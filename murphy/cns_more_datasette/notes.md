### Do the results make sense?

make logical sense? usually. make practical sense? not really. like, for a story about a cargo ship stuck in the chesapeake, "Cargo Salvage" definitely makes *sense*, but it's not *useful*. but that in and of itself makes sense. the prompt was incredibly vague. the last time we did this, i had to tell it this:

```
list five umbrella categories that describe the main focus of the story, using one word for each if possible and a maximum of two words if necessary. use only terms that could be used as tags to categorize stories on a website, remembering that news consumers search primarily for broad categories like news, politics or sports, and typically not for specific or niche terms. only include topics that are nationally relevant or relevant to marylanders. each output should be simple enough that an average tenth-grader might research it for a school project, and broad enough that a general news publication in maryland would publish at least 10 stories annually that would fall under that category.
```

it wasn't perfect, but the outputs were far less variable.
