According to court documents, the State filed charges this week against Gwendolyn Persina, age 48 of Chester.Those charges include causing life threatening injuries while operating a vehicle, driving under the influence of alcohol, driving while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance and driving on a suspended license.\nThe multi-vehicle incident on the westbound span of the bridge had travel shut down for several hours.\nThrough the course of investigation, the Maryland Department of Transportation Authority Police Collision Reconstruction Unit determined Persina was driving at high speeds and erratically, contributing to the crash.\nQueen Anne's County State's Attorney Lance Richardson said he requested the court to hold Persina in the detention center during the Aug. 29 bail review because she was on probation for a DWI at the time of the accident.\nIn 2022, Persina had been found guilty in Queen Anne's County Circuit Court of driving while impaired by alcohol. Her 18 month probation was still in effect at the time of the January incident.\nRichardson said he made the request because he believed Persina is \"a threat to public safety with her potential to drive in a dangerous manner again if she were to be released on pre trial supervision.\"\n\"The chain reaction collision also ultimately caused an innocent man to lose his arm in the accident,\" Richardson said.\nAn arrest warrant was issued for Persina on Aug. 27. During a bail hearing on Aug. 29, Persina was ordered to be held pending trial. A jury trial has been set for February. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Hummingbird Inn: a bed and breakfast filled with love and community\n\n August 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Business \n \n 769\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Owning a bed an breakfast was not a dream Eric Levinson had on his own. The plan was created alongside his late husband, Kevin Woloshyn.The Hummingbird Inn, located on North Aurora Street in Easton, is a product of their shared love of traveling and hospitality.\nThe foundation of the inn and their love began many years ago online, when computer monitors had one color and there were no graphics, according to Levinson. Levinson, who at the time was working in Manhattan, New York, in IT management, went on Internet Relay Chat and began talking to Woloshyn, who was from Alberta, Canada. They connected and soon began sending letters to each other and talking on the phone.\nEventually, they made the decision to have Woloshyn move to New York. Same-sex marriage was not legal at the time, and the couple had to find alternatives to be together through work visas, but once they, did they did not want to be apart.\n\"He was one of these life-of-the-party guys,\" Levinson said. \"He would walk into a room, and everybody was just enamored with him. He was very charismatic, and outgoing, and funny and silly, but extremely intelligent. He spoke seven languages. He and I traveled the world together.\"\nLevinson said Woloshyn was determined to help him find his passion. Bit by bit, Levinson tried to hone in his interest of traveling, cooking and connecting to people. He enrolled in the New York Culinary Institute and began working in a couple of restaurants in Manhattan.\nEventually the idea of opening a bed and breakfast came to the couple, and they decided it would be a project they could do together in the future.\nAfter years of being together Levinson and Woloshyn moved to Canada, where same-sex marriage was legal, and got married. The plan was to wait for same-sex marriage to be legalized before moving back to the U.S., and at the time the issue was being presented to the Supreme Court.\nBut just before same-sex marriage was legalized, Woloshyn was tragically killed by a drunk driver.\n\"Ever since Kevin was taken away, I realized that tomorrow is not guaranteed,\" Levinson said. \"You have to live every life to the fullest.\"\nWith the help of his sister Brooke Drake and his realtor (and future best friend) Jana Mewedith, Levinson found what is now the Hummingbird Inn.\nIt has become a popular bed and breakfast where Levinson hosts events such as weddings, dark dinner experiences, annual Pride events, halloween parities, tea events and fundraisers for local nonprofits.\nDrake said she is proud of her brother and the success he has found in Easton.\n\"It was their dream, and he's done a great job to bring that dream to life,\" Drake said. \"We, me and my husband, have just been so happy for him to have him be able to change his life like this and move forward into a wonderful community that's embraced him and made his inn a success.\"\nLevinson is known as an \"ambassador of Easton\" by many of his guests.\nDan Schumacher, a former guest and current Easton resident, credits Levinson's hospitality for bringing him and his husband to the town.\n\"Eric and the Hummingbird Inn have been instrumental in attracting new residents to the town of Easton,\" Schumacher said. \"I know a number of couples who visited because the inn allows dogs, can host weddings or because it's LGBTQ friendly (the latter of which attracted my husband Rob and I) … Many of us have purchased homes here and now call Easton our home.\"\nThroughout the inn, hummingbirds can be found in every room, framed on many walls and tiny crystal birds floating on every ceiling. In the entrance, there is a wall of framed cards and art of hummingbirds sent by guests called a \"charm\" wall, since that is the official name of a group of hummingbirds.\nLevinson said that for the vast majority of his life, he had no connection to the bird. But after his husband died, he began receiving many sympathy cards with hummingbirds on them.\nFor a while, he was confused by all the hummingbird cards. After a bit of research, he learned of the lore associated with the bird.\nHummingbirds are thought to take on the spirit of people who were charismatic and full of life after they had passed, Levinson said.\n\"I used the hummingbird as a remembrance symbol after he died, and then when the inn started to actually come together, I knew I was going to rename it,\" Levinson said. \"… Knowing this was something that Kevin and I were originally planning to do together, that's why it's called Hummingbird Inn — because it's in his memory.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Across from the entrance to the complex is an open field about the size of a football field.For most of the years that we have lived here that field was left in its natural state. That meant lots of wild flowers (chicory, daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne's lace, Joe Pye, milkweed, etc.).Also birds were among the inhabitants, especially redwing blackbirds, as well as many butterflies (swallowtails, monarchs, buckeyes, fritillaries, cabbage whites, blues, morning cloaks).Now twice a year it is mowed down to an ugly field of clumps of vegetation.And why? So I can see the bypass.To destroy such a natural magnet for native flowers, butterflies and birds makes a mockery of leadership that professes to care about the environment.My question is: What government agencies make this decision - town, county or state? I want the responsible government entity to be aware of the unhappiness that this brutal treatment of a formerly beautiful field has caused.JAMES CARROLL Easton \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore had decided to postpone implementing the experimental Blueprint for Maryland in our schools, due to the $2.7 billion deficit accrued by the state of Maryland.The Blueprint has been described as follows:\n\"It has taken the focus of schools off teaching students the academic and content knowledge they need to be successful adults in our society and made them 'one stop shopping' for services like medical, dental, nutritional, social engineering and mental health. It has promoted the implementation of 'restorative discipline' which has created a generation of students who are out of control and violent since there are no consequences for bad behavior. It has drained our schools of teachers as they flee to other states where working conditions are better even if the salaries are lower. These are just some of the negative impacts.\" (Easton Gazette, Dec. 20, 2024)\nHow disappointed was I to read in The Star Democrat (Jan. 15, 2025) that the Talbot Board of Education wishes to implement the Blueprint anyway, especially equity in math, with an $8.6 million increase to the school budget. With nearly 60% of Talbot County students (grades 3-8) showing a lack of proficiency in basic English language skills, while mathematics proficiency for Talbot County students stands at a dismal 17.2%, the last thing we need is for our children to be guinea pigs in yet another social experiment.\nWhat is equity in math? According to Edutopia: \"Math teachers can use short activities based on student goals related to equity in order to make classes feel more inclusive and accessible.\" The key words are \"feel\" \"inclusive\" and \"accessible.\"\nI was a sixth grader once, a sixth grader who hated math class. We had a strict teacher, of whom most of us were afraid. But we all learned to multiply and divide, in spite of the negative feelings, unlike, it appears, many of today's children who are not even being encouraged to memorize their times tables.\nThose negative feelings can give way to feelings of confidence and assurance when a subject has been mastered. I beg our educators to return to basics and stop making our children the latest casualties of yet another half-baked, ill-conceived progressive scheme for remaking society according to the designs of Karl Marx or Saul Alinsky.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Maryland State Police are investigating the report of abuse and neglect.\nBaker and Caroline County State's Attorney Sloane Franklin met with the secretary of Human Services about a year ago to address long CPS response times.\n\"We were promised a lot of changes, and unfortunately, those changes have not come to fruition,\" Baker said.\nThe Caroline County Department of Social Services, which oversees CPS, did not respond to requests for comment.\nBen Shnider, director of communications for the state Department of Human Services, which oversees the Caroline County department, wrote in an email to the Star Democrat, \"The safety and well-being of Maryland's children is our highest priority, and local departments of social services respond to every report of alleged child abuse or neglect.\"\nAccording to Department of Human Services policy, the Caroline County Child Protective Services response times fall within the guidelines for responding to reports for the examples that Baker cited.\nThe policy calls for:\nAnswering calls of physical or sexual abuse within 24 hours.Answering calls for reports of neglect within five calendar days.Answering calls for cases of substance-exposed newborns within 48 hours.\nBut Baker and Franklin said this policy leaves law enforcement to act as a middle man, but addressing the problem is complicated.\nThe Caroline County Department of Social Services is a state-run agency over which the county has no control, making it difficult for local agencies and officials to affect change, Franklin said.\n\"I have no power to enforce changes, I can only make recommendations,\" Franklin said.\nBaker and Franklin said there have been unfulfilled promises of solutions since the problems began during the pandemic but were vague as to what those problems and promises were, saying they wanted to preserve their working relationships with CPS.\nBoth said they want a better working relationship with Child Protective Services. State law mandates law enforcement agencies working with CPS.\nAfter-hours reports of child neglect or abuse can be handled in a few different ways. In cases involving high or even moderate risks, a Child Protective Services case worker should be automatically dispatched, but if they cannot respond, law enforcement, generally the sheriff's office, will be sent.\nBecause of the mandated joint investigations, Baker said law enforcement officers have been picking up the slack when the case workers do not arrive, leading to increased frustration by the officers on the scene.\nPart of the problem may be vacancies in the state Department of Human Services, where there is a 7% vacancy rate, although Baker said he thinks the root cause stems from procedural and cultural issues that start with upper management.\n\"I would say that everything starts from upper management and works its way down as far as a cultural issue,\" he said. \"And I think that there are some procedural issues within the agency itself.\"\nBaker spent a majority of his career working in child abuse investigations and said they are near and dear to his heart.\n\"I know how hard that is, so it's very disheartening to me when we do not have good partners,\" Baker said.\nShnider, the Department of Human Services communications director, said his agency \"is committed to holding ourselves accountable.\" His email statement said the department will address any systemic issues that are identified through the investigation.\n\"Any failure to respond to a report of abuse or neglect in a timely manner is unacceptable,\" Shnider said. \"When mistakes are made, we hold ourselves accountable and take action to ensure we do better moving forward.\"\nIn the meantime, Baker and Franklin hope the investigation will bring systemic change that will enhance their partnerships and the safety of the children in Caroline County.\n\"I hope that some accountability and changes will come to better protect the kids,\" Franklin said.\nThis report has been updated to clarify that MSP and DHS are conducting separate investigations. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In addition, local health departments will host listening sessions to understand community needs and solicit ideas and recommendations. Feedback on the program will close on Sept. 30.\nThe program will provide $50 billion to 50 states over the course of five years. Maryland is projected to see $100 million of those funds. However, the state still needs to apply for the program in order to receive the money.\nHalf of those funds will be distributed based on rurality, quality of the application and state policy, while the other half will be distributed equally among all states upon approved applications, according to Maryland Department of Health's website. Once applications are approved, funds will be distributed from 2026 to 2030.\nThe strategic goals of the program are prevention and management of chronic disease, behavioral health, sustainable access, workforce development, innovative care and tech innovation.\nThe dates of the listening sessions can be found at health.maryland.gov, and questions regarding the process or feedback on the program can be sent to mdh.transformruralhealth@maryland.gov.

Newnam Armory at 509 S. Cross St., Chestertown.Members of the Frank M. Jarman American Legion Post 36 came to pay homage to those soldiers lost on the beaches of Normandy that bleak day in 1944.\nOf the 2,501 US troops who died, many were from here.\nAt the foot of the stone monument, post members laid a wreath and flowers donated by The Mill of Kingstown, showing the Legion is just as active in the community as when they had their building at 9155 American Legion Road.\nThe monument reads: \"In grateful tribute to the men of the medical detachment of the 115th Infantry Regiment Maryland National Guard, both living and dead this shrine is dedicated. Their valiant efforts helped preserve freedom in America, 1941-1945.\"\nAt that sacred spot, incoming Post Commander Tim Lloyd, a veteran of the Navy, provided remarks.\n\"We lost some good people, and their sacrifice gave us our freedom today.\"\nCommander Paul Showalter talked about the clandestine nature of the mission the Kent County soldiers trained for at the Armory.\n\"Two days prior to June 6, 1944, the activity to get prepared to go to Normandy wasn't mentioned in (President) Roosevelt's fireside chats,\" he said.\nRoosevelt only hinted at it.\nIn the armory, built in 1931, was where those soldiers trained. From that training area, men went to the European theater and engaged in the largest amphibious invasion in military history, a battle that changed the trajectory of World War II. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This new special tax was designed to directly tie development to available funding for open space and recreational facilities for the public good. Now because of the state budget deficit the Program Open Space funds are being threatened with total removal for the next four years.Program Open Space supports parks, forests and wildlife management areas and is an important contributor to the state's conservation commitments and goals. It also supports community playgrounds, ball fields, tennis courts, hiking trails, historic sites, Chesapeake Bay water access and multiple other community benefits. These programs are important for citizens' wellbeing and also have substantial economic benefit. Quality of life is a very important factor in home and business investment in a community.\nI am impressed with the value of open spaces when I visit the Oxford Conservation Park and see the park being enjoyed by people of all ages and abilities. I see toddlers running around, senior citizens — some proceeding slowly with the help of a cane, dog owners with their enthusiastic pets and many others enjoying the outdoors.\nI am particularly mindful of the many citizens who safely walked in the park during the worst days of the pandemic for exercise, tranquility and inspiration. The park also has become a highly valued locale for viewing wildlife with, for example, a large number of bird species identified, including recent sightings of quail.\nProgram Open Space provides very important benefits to residents of the Eastern Shore. I encourage you to contact our Talbot County representatives ask that they continue funding for Program Open Space.\nSARAH RAMSEY\nOxford \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The town was the organizer of the event. It is the first anniversary,\" Willie G. Woods, president of the NAACP Caroline County Branch, said. \"We were there to support what was happening in Federalsburg. They had a cross section of vendors and participants and music and food.\"\nWoods said it is important to stand up and be heard.\n\"You have to come together and share your ideas, your viewpoints and your respective cultures. And you have to respect the contributions that the diverse population is making,\" she said.\nBrandy James, a Federalsburg Town Council member elected in last year's historic election, said the event was a success and that there was a good crowd.\n\"It symbolized unity to me. We had people from every aspect of Federalsburg. The faith-based community was there. Law enforcement was there. Not just Federalsburg police, but also the Caroline County Sheriff was there,\" said James.\nShe said there were many vendors there, including the Caroline County Health Department and smoking cessation resources.\n\"The NAACP has a table, Men For Change, there were churches with tables out there. They were giving away free cotton candy, and the kids had a blast. It was a great way to see everyone from across the lifespan come together and celebrate the unity of Federalsburg,\" James said.\nShe said the actual business of sitting on the council is slower than she would like, but she said everyone is being fairly heard.\n\"I am hopeful to see more African American people run for office in the future, and I am hopeful that the town business will get a little more streamlined and more organized,\" she said.\nThe Sept. 26 celebration and plaque were requirements of a settlement in a 2023 lawsuit brought against the town in federal court under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Through months of charter amendments, legislation and federal court rulings, the town's previous at-large election system was changed in June to a two-district system to ensure more representation of Federalsburg's Black residents. District 1 has a 64% Black population and District 2 is predominantly white.\nThe sign that was placed at Brooklyn said, in part, \"In coordination with the Mayor and the Council of Federalsburg, created an opportunity for Federalsburg's Black community to elect two representatives to the Federalsburg Town Council. Through their efforts, with support of the ACLU of Maryland and the guidance from the United States District Court, the town adopted and implemented a new and fair election system, undoing the 200 year exclusion of Black residents from town government. Federalsburg's historic election on September 26, 2023 resulted in two Black women winning seats to the town council: Darlene Pitt Hammond and Brandy James. This day forever marks a turning point in Federalsburg's diverse community.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

MICHAELS — The St. Michaels commissioners plan to invest $215,000 from this fiscal year and next fiscal year into three new police vehicles for the St. Michaels Police Department.\"These guys are always in need for updated equipment,\" Alfred Mercier, commissioners president, said.\nThe company that St. Michaels is buying the police vehicles through will allow the commissioners to pay for one vehicle with this year's fbudget and two in next year's budget. The town will receive all three vehicles up front.\n\"These are all coming out of speed camera funds that are held in a separate account, so unless there's going to be changes in the FY26 budget, this should be something that we can accomplish,\" Don Richardson, town manager, said.\nWhile the budget for the vehicles is $215,000, the three vehicles will cost $146,820. The rest will be used for graphics, lights and equipment.\nJeffery Oswald, St. Michaels chief of police, credits the St. Michaels commissioners for their help getting the new vehicles.\n\"I would have to thank to the commissioners because they're always have the support on keeping our equipment up-to-date to match other agencies surrounding us,\" Oswald said. \"We want to keep our emergency vehicles safe and well equipped so we can provide public safety to the town.\n\"Our fleet is aging, so having the cost and the liabilities of an aging fleet, so not only it will save us money on maintenance, it will provide a better look to attract officers with new equipment and new vehicles.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Weiss said. \"My office will hold accountable applicants who undermine the integrity of the federal grant process by knowingly failing to submit complete and truthful applications.\"\nAccording to the settlement agreement, in 2020, UD accepted a grant from NASA, which is prohibited from using funds to collaborate with China or any Chinese-owned companies. While accepting the grant, UD certified that the money would not be used to collaborate or coordinate with China.\nHowever, the government later learned that one of lead professors associated with the grant, Xiao-Hai Yan, did in fact have ties to China.\nYan is a faculty member at Xiamen University in China, received funding from the National Science Foundation of China and participates in a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with knowledge or access to foreign technology intellectual property, according to the settlement.\nThe settlement does not constitute an admission of liability by UD, nor does it prevent the government from pursuing criminal charges against any parties involved.\n\"Along with our law enforcement partners, we will continue to safeguard taxpayer funds that are intended for federal research and development programs,\" said Adelle K. Harris, a special agent in charge for the NASA inspector general.\nYan has been a UD professor since 1990. He teaches in the School of Marine Science and Policy and serves as director of the Center for Remote Sensing.\nAccording to a glowing profile of Yan on UD's marketing website, he is \"internationally known for using satellites in tracking the notorious weathermaker El Niño and in developing new techniques for monitoring global climate change and coastal responses.\" In 2019, he received the Outstanding Doctoral Graduate Advising and Mentoring Award from UD President Dennis Assanis.\nThe article also praises Yan for playing \"an integral role in the university's efforts to improve and expand the intellectual exchange between UD and Xiamen University\" — the Chinese university that UD failed to disclose Yan's involvement with while accepting the NASA grant. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As owner of Green's Septic, he and his employee of six years Pete Padley enjoy educating kids on the vehicles each year.\nOther than the big trucks, local and state emergency personnel were on site giving demonstrations.\nChief Logan Quinn from the Kent County Office of Emergency Services had lifesaving items on display: cardiac heart equipment, CPR devices and a pediatric response bag.\nChestertown Police Chief Ron Dixon presented some everyday tools they use to assist the public: bolt cutters, pry bars and jumper cables.\n\"When people see these items, we hope they see we're there for the community,\" Dixon said.\nWith a generous crowd scattered throughout the large grounds, it was calm, a good environment to learn, talking to equipment operators.\nThat calm was momentarily shattered at around 11:30 a.m. when a helicopter from the Maryland State Police was spotted hovering over the grounds. As soon as the chopper touched grass, kids and adults made a beeline to it, excited to get a tour.\n\"It's an impressive bird,\" said airline pilot of 25 years John Strigle. As a civilian volunteer he had a wealth of knowledge he shared along with the state police operators.\nThey answered questions, letting kids sit in the Agusta Westland AW139, creating lots of memories and providing parents with photo opportunities.\nOther than vehicles, the various Kent County 4-H clubs manned stations running activities for the public to enjoy. The Kent Fuzzy Tails & Shiny Scales group allowed a chance to pet the rabbits, talk to their owners and participate in a prize-winning activity.\nPrincipal Agent Associate, 4-H Youth Development Kent County, Beth Hill, behind an inventive bike/blender making pumpkin smoothies, said these kinds of events help generate new members.\nIn addition kids participated in a hay bale toss and Tic Tac Toe with pumpkins, while Matt Jones gave hayrides and various organizations like Rock Hall Dental fielded questions at tables.\nCo-organizer Cindy Moore said Touch-a-truck came about to show appreciation to the 4-H clubs who maintained the place year-round.\nShe thanked everyone for showing up that day.\n\"We all work together on this,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jimmy Olsen (Jack Larson) and Perry White's sister (veteran character actress Mabel Albertson) vanish while investigating a voodoo cult in Haiti, sending Perry (John Hamilton) and Clark Kent (George Reeves) on a quest to find them.\"Freaky Friday\" (Freeform, Monday, Sept. 11): Filmed a couple of times previously and again since, this fanciful body-switch comedy has served the Disney studio well, including in this 2003 version. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are quite enjoyable as the mother and daughter who magically make the exchange, a therapist and a would-be musician who each get a new and quite deep understanding of the other by walking in their shoes, quite literally. Mark Harmon and Chad Michael Murray also appear.\"Magnum, p.i.\" (getTV, Monday, Sept. 11): \"Limbo\" is an appropriate title for the episode that concluded Season 7 of the series, since it originally was intended to end the entire show but CBS ended up renewing it for one more round. A seriously wounded Magnum (Tom Selleck) is in a coma, and his ghostly self pays visits to his friends to consider the times he's had with each. Elements of the story continued to play out over the first couple of episodes of Season 8. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now it continues through his son Ed Nabb Jr.\nAs part of the Carlisle Mission Team, Michael Marra collected funds for construction materials for island home repair, including ramps and deck rails for many of the older or disabled residents.\nEvery summer for the past 10 years, missionaries go to the island for vacation Bible school, outreach and more, according to Marra.\nSince the 1600s, generations of families have lived on the island that faces environmental distress, and it is enormously important to try and keep that culture going, he said.\n\"To let them know they are not forgotten,\" he said. \"We're there to uplift their spirits as well as their houses.\"\nThrough a match in donations, over $15,000 was raised with all funds donated by Holly Run participants supporting the work.\nA newer member of Chesapeake Sport Pilot, this was pilot Lenora Kandiner's first time participating in the Holly Run. Kandiner last flew to Tangier Island in the 1980s from New Jersey. \"You can't be here without hearing about the Holly Run,\" she said.\n\"Pilots always want to fly somewhere, so here's a good cause,\" breakfast elf volunteer Sandy Dewey said.\nMore information about the Holly Run can be found at tangierhollyrun.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lost in the rubble - How how high is the death toll in Gaza? - Biden, U.S don't trust casualty numbers from Palestinian health agency in Hamas-controlled war zone\n\n October 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1567\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n War casualty figures in Gaza - including the number of children killed - frequently cited by international groups and media outlets are being questioned by U.S. officials, including by President Joe Biden, because they are coming from a Palestinian health agency in the Hamas-controlled territory.The dispute comes as Israel Defense Forces step up already intense bombing of Gaza with ground attacks in the Hamas-controlled Palestinian area along the Mediterranean Sea.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday IDF ground forces have entered the \"gates of evil\", announcing the next phases of attacks against Hamas inside Gaza, which has a population of more than 2 million people.A sustained ground invasion faces grim realities of urban warfare and a rising death toll. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said Friday Israel's \"ground war\" had begun with power and internet outages across Gaza and increased tank and artillery fire.\"Israel just launched a ground war on Gaza. Outcome will be a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions for years to come,\" Safadi said in a statement on Twitter/X.'THEY'RE NOT RELIABLE'The Palestinian Health Authority is the main information source from the Palestinian side for deaths and injuries during the war between Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hamas after the latter's Oct. 7 attacks inside Israel.Israeli officials said those attacks killed more than 1,400 people (including close to 450 children) and Hamas took more than 220 hostages. U.S. officials said 33 American citizens (many with dual Israeli citizenship) died in the attacks and there are also a still an unconfirmed, small number of Americans missing or also held hostage by Hamas The Palestinian Health Authority reported Friday more than 7,300 people have died in Gaza since the IDF started - including more than 2,900 children. Those numbers are going to expected to rise as the war continues, more ground battles ensue and Gaza civilians (close to half of them children) continue to get caught in the crossfires of the Holy Land war.But American and Israeli officials - including Biden - question how accurate the fatality figures are from the health group which is under the auspices of Hamas and its military and governmental control over Gaza.\"I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed. I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's the price of waging a war,\" Biden said Oct. 25.\"I think we should be incredibly careful. I think - well, not 'we' - the Israelis should be incredibly careful to be sure that they're focusing on going after the folks that are propagating this war against Israel. And it's against their interest when that doesn't happen,\" Biden said. \"But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.\" John Kirby, the White House's national security spokesman, reiterated Biden's point during a media session Thursday.\"We absolutely know that the death toll continues to rise in Gaza.Of course, we know that. But what we're saying is that we shouldn't rely on numbers put forth by Hamas and the Ministry of Health,\" Kirby said.Kirby also pointed to the bombing of the Al Ahli Arab Hospital, which is operated by the Anglican church and Episcopal Archdiocese of Jerusalem, on Oct. 14 which the U.S. and IDF says was ht by an errant Islamic Jihad rocket.Palestinian officials blamed Israel for the Christian hospital blast and reported a disputed much higher fatality figure.\"Well, do you remember that attack on the hospital? And what did the Gaza Ministry of Health put out?Something like 500? They slapped the number of 500 on it, you know, within the hour of - of that attack. And, of course, they - the same ministry of health said it was an Israeli airstrike, so we know that's not true. And we've now since found out that the numbers aren't that high, either. They never got up to 500,\" Kirby said.\"They're just not reliable,\" he continued.'UNDER THE RUBBLE'In response to the doubts, the Gazabased health ministry released names, genders and ages of residents who have died in the war since Oct. 7.Media outlets as well as international groups frequently cite the health ministry numbers with some defending their accuracy. They also argue the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza should not get lost in other disputes.The United National Relief and Works Agency cites the Palestinian health agency numbers and said there are more than 1,500 people in Gaza missing \"under the rubble of destroyed buildings - including 870 children.\" Save the Children International, Amnesty International and other relief groups also cite health ministry numbers as they worry about the situation in Gaza, including the spread of diseases.Defense for Children, a Palestinian group, said the number of deaths in Gaza reported by the healthy ministry, could be lower than the reality of the ground saying there are missing persons \"under the rubble\" of the war and who have not been confirmed as dead or alive.DOC also blames the U.S. for the deaths.\"Israeli forces are actively committing the crime of genocide against Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,\" said Brad Parker, attorney and senior policy adviser at DCIP. \"The United States is not simply standing by, but is actively enabling and supporting the gravest crime under international law making the United States complicit. Israeli warplanes are entirely U.S. sourced and the munitions killing Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are overwhelmingly American-made weapons.\" The U.S. backs Israel in the war and has moved two aircraft carrier groups, additional get squadrons and 2,900 troops - including a Marine rapid response force to the region. Biden wants Congress to approve $14 billion in military aid for Israel as part of a larger $106 billion war package that includes money for Ukraine in it war with Russia. The U.S. already sends Israel $3.3 billion annually in military aid along with significant outlays to Egypt and Jordan, who refuse to take Gaza refugees.The DOC group said the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire with lack of potable drinking water and more than 8,000 new COVID cases among Palestinian residents. \"Many people have resorted to drinking salt water from agricultural wells,\" the Palestinian group said.Oxfam International worries about the spread of cholera and other diseases with water treatment and sewage shutdown because of the war. Relief and groups say the situation in Gaza which has a population of more than 2.2 million (close to half of which are children) is dire.\"The situation for civilians is already intolerable. Our staff are telling us that in some cases, there are up to 70 people crammed into a single room.\" Amitabh Behar, Oxfam International's executive director.'SLEEPING WITHIN'On Friday, Oct. 27, Pope Francis, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Pierbattista Pizzabella and other Christian leaders held a day of prayer calling for peace and the end violence and war in the Holy Land.The World Council of Churches and Patriarchs and Heads of Churches in Jerusalem are also calling for de-escalations of the war and the protection of churches and other places of refugees in Gaza. There are between 1,000 and 1,300 Christians in the heavily Muslim Palestinian territory. Another 50,000 Christians live in the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to the U.S. State Department.The push comes after Orthodox church leaders and the WCC say an IDF airstrike aimed at nearby Hamas installation struck the compound of the St. Porphyrius Church Oct. 19, which was built in the 5th century and is one of the oldest churches in the world.\"These blasts led to the sudden and catastrophic collapse of two church halls around the scores of refugees, including women and children, sleeping within,\" according to a statement by the Patriarchs and Heads of Churches in Jerusalem. \"Dozens found themselves instantly crushed beneath the rubble.\" Eighteen people have died, including nine children, according to WCC.The Holy Land Christian churches have also called for more humanitarian aid be allowed into Gaza, for all sides to stop targeting civilians and for a ceasefire.HAMAS' FAULTThe IDF says misfired rockets from Hamas and other Islamic militants are resulting in deaths and injuries in Gaza, including the Anglican hospital blast, and that Hamas has stolen or hoarded fuel that could be use by hospitals and to operate water treatment plants and sewage pumping stations.\"Hamas is determining the level of the humanitarian crisis by not handing over that fuel to the United Nations,\" an IDF spokesman said Oct. 25.The day before, the IDF posted images of fuel storage facilities operated by Hamas in response to UNRWA pushes for fuel shipments into Gaza during the wartime siege.\"These fuel tanks are inside Gaza,\" IDF said pointing to reconnaissance photos and responding to the UN group's bid to get fuel included in relief shipments. \"They contain more than 500,000 liters of fuel.Ask Hamas if you can have some.\" The Israelis also posted social media graphics and information contending Hamas has underground facilities beneath the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Hamas continues to hold more than 220 Israelis (as well as some Americans with dual Israeli citizenship) in Gaza as leverage as the war and IDF bombardments rage and intensify. \n \n Caption: ABED KHALED/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nA wounded Palestinian woman runs following Israeli airstrikes that targeted her neighbourhood in Gaza City, Monday, Oct. 23, 2023.\n \nNASSER NASSER/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nPalestinian protesters hold posters and chant anti Israel slogans during a demonstration in solidarity with the Gaza Strip, in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Friday, Oct. 27, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eastern Shore legislators discuss education funding and county burdens\n\n February 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 398\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Speaking to Eastern Shore legislators Friday, the Department of Legislative Services outlined how local governments may assume costs passed down from the state as Gov. Wes Moore and the state legislature aim to tackle a $3 billion deficit.Hiram Burch, the local government research and analysis manager for the department, shared that local governments across the state will have to pick up around $144 million of the gaps in the fiscal year 2026 budget as proposed.\nIn Caroline and Talbot counties, projected local cost shifts are in the $700,000 range. Dorchester County is at $830,000, while Queen Anne's County leads the pack for the Mid-Shore at $970,000. Kent is the lowest of the five counties with a $300,000 projection.\nMany of those cost shifts come in the education realm, including teacher retirement funding.\nDel. Steven Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) questioned whether record education funding that the governor's office has touted was due to the governor's actions or the result of The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's funding plan for education passed under former Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\"The governor's saying we have record funding to education,\" Arentz said. \"And I'm wondering if that's mandated from The Blueprint.\"\n\"Most education funding is formula-based,\" Burch said. \"He's required to put that in.\"\nBurch said while Moore did provide some \"enhanced funding,\" most of the state aid is required by formulas in The Blueprint.\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) said she's hearing from constituents that they're concerned about special education funding amid around $200 million in proposed cuts to the state Developmental Disabilities Administration.\nBurch said that none of the state aid reductions will affect special education.\n\"There were reductions in collaborative learning that impacted the foundation program, the compensatory aid program (and) the English language learners program, but this reduction did not affect special education funding,\" Burch said.\n\"That is the one area that has been held harmless by his proposed reductions and postponing the implementation of The Blueprint,\" he added.\nAt the close of Friday's budgetary discussions, Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said the state is \"very willing to pass unfunded mandates down to the counties.\"\n\"What this means really for Eastern Shore citizens, is their tax rates, their rates on their property, are going up,\" Adams said, referencing increasing property assessments. And that's how we're unfortunately going to be funding Maryland.\"\n\"That's my raw take on it, and many of our members are very concerned,\" Adams said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Realtors work to protect themselves on job\n\n September 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A15 | Section: News \n \n 584\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Smoke detectors and locking doors are obvious safety techniques for homeowners, but there is so much more to keeping homeowners and Realtors safe during the buying and selling process.Real estate leads come in many ways, and a referral from a friend or family member is different than a walk-in or website referral. Realtors are in a unique position that sometimes puts them in harms way.As a buyer or seller being aware of this will make all involved have a better understanding of why Realtors ask or do certain things.Local Realtors say they feel the most vulnerable at open houses and when showing property. Nationally, 4% of agents reported being victims of assault, robbery, theft and other undisclosed crimes.Many of the incidents occurred at open houses, home showings and in the agent's own vehicle.Although locally this is rare, it is still a possibility. Each September, Realtors are reminded about potential risks on the job and are asked to review the Member Safety Report (NAR.Realtor/Safety) for themselves and their clients.Allowing strangers to enter your homes always comes with risks, noted Megan Rosendale, president of Mid-Shore Board of Realtors. That is why jewelry, valuables, and medicines, should be locked up or removed from the property.Some agents make use of visual recordings and posted signs that say \"camera in use\" to try to deter thieves. There was a situation a few years ago in Talbot County where a person was going to multiple open houses and taking prescriptions, the police and other agents were notified.Realtors also use a lock box system called SentriLock.SentiLock records the code of the agent who opened the box plus the time the box was opened and when the key was returned. A combination box does not have this protection, and once the combination code is given out there is no way to know who is entering your property.Rosendale said, \"I also speak with my clients about not showing their home by themselves, not all agents, and buyers are who they say they are. We tell our children not to talk to strangers.I tell my sellers not to talk to other agents or buyers and have them refer all inquiries to me.\" Here are a few ways some Realtors protect themselves and their clients:▪ They take a picture of the license plate of the buyer's car and the client's identification.▪ They do not drive or ride with their clients unless they know them well.▪ They hold the first meeting with the clients in the real estate office or a public location.▪ They do not hold an open house alone.▪ They never meet a client for the first time at a vacant property.▪ They use a smart phone or application to track their whereabouts and to alert colleagues in case of▪ emergency.▪ They have their phone charged, carry a charging cord and hotspot for poor cell phone areas.▪ They carry mace and maybe even a weapon.We understand that meeting clients in private locations can be a part of our job, as well as hosting open houses and showing vacant properties in areas with poor or no phone coverage, noted Rosendale.That is why it is important to take preventative measures and be aware of the surroundings to help the agents and clients stay safe from would-be criminals.The Mid-Shore Board of Realtors mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and utilize real property.

    "content": "Demolition of remaining Key Bridge structures beginning around July 7\n\n June 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Matt Wynn mwynn@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 457\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Demolition of the remaining Key Bridge structures will begin on or about July 7, the Maryland Transportation Authority announced on June 26.The work is expected to take several months to complete and will involve the use of heavy machinery to dismantle what is left of the bridge.\nThe process will begin with the removal of the bridge deck over the river, followed by demolition of sections over Hawkins Point and then Sollers Point, the Maryland Transportation Authority said in a release.\nThis phase of work focuses on removing portions of the existing structure that interfere with the alignment of the new bridge.\nNo controlled detonations will occur.\nThe general demolition sequence will include the removal of deck, barriers and parapets over the river from both Hawkins Point and Sollers Point, followed by the removal of deck, barriers, parapets, girders and piers on the landside approaches, down to just below ground level.\nFinally, the original north and south abutments will be removed.\nNearby communities should expect to see active tug and barge operations on the river, with heavy equipment and trucks visible on the existing bridge structure.\nBarges will serve as protective shielding during demolition and must be avoided by waterway users. Machinery used may include excavators, concrete saws, vacuums, cranes and trucks.\nAn on-site concrete crusher will recycle materials for haul roads and staging areas, reducing truck trips and cost.\nTypical large construction project noise is expected from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.\nEquipment is being installed in nearby communities to capture baseline noise and vibration data before the start of demolition and upcoming construction activities.\nBuoys will mark a safety zone, no entry area around active work areas.\nNotices will be issued to designate speed restrictions and safety zones to ensure the safe passage of vessels near the construction area.\nThe Maryland Transportation Authority said that it will continue to provide updates and advance notice of any work that may affect nearby communities, roads or waterways.\nBased on months of field investigations and engineering analysis, the bridge alignment is slightly east or downriver of the original structure, remaining entirely within the Maryland Transportation Authority's existing right-of-way. To proceed with construction, the Maryland Transportation Authority is requesting modifications to permits that have been issued by the Maryland Board of Public Works, Maryland Department of the Environment, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard in support of the Key Bridge Rebuild, according to the release.\nThe permit modification requests will reflect updates to the bridge pier foundation design, pier protection elements, and trestle configuration. They also include a decrease in authorized impacts to tidal waters and some additional impacts to non-tidal wetlands and waterways.\nA reevaluation of the project's categorical exclusion will also be submitted to the Federal Highway Administration.\nNo significant increase in environmental impacts is expected, the release said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Interdisciplinary in Computer Science and Natural Science\nOccupation: Installation Tech at Ustreamwifi LLC\nPrevious political experience: None\n1. Why are you running for the Ward 4 seat on the Easton Town Council?\nI love Easton. One day I hope to have a family here, and I want to ensure Easton stays safe and livable (not just survivable) for future families and its current population. It's also very important for young people to step up and get involved in our civil government and approach things with a new perspective and fresh ideas.\n2. What issues will you prioritize if elected?\nFour points: Financial transparency and responsibility, public safety and stronger communities, smart growth and local business support, and infrastructure and quality of life.\n3. What changes would you make to the town's budget, and what budget items should not be cut?\nThere is a lot of prospective future growth in Easton. We have to make sure the police are well funded. On top of that, the unnecessary fees for businesses need to be cut back, and the process needs to be streamlined. That's just the tip of the iceberg.\n4. While the town has grown, affordable housing remains a challenge for residents. How should the town build more housing, in particular affordable housing?\nAffordable housing in not necessarily the answer. I want to take a stand that more starter homes be developed in Easton so young families (and old) can afford to live here.\n5. What are your plans for public safety in Easton? What can be improved?\nI'm pretty sure I addressed this earlier, but to expound: our police department is at least 5 people understaffed. That should never be the case. Increasing their funding while cutting ridiculous and unnecessary items would be the first item on the agenda (some might say that the town will then have less money to use elsewhere, but that just means they need to be more responsible with how they spend taxpayer dollars).\n6. In addition to serving the Town of Easton as a whole, what are your plans to improve your ward specifically?\nI want to (above all else) listen to my ward. I want to be easily accessible, open minded to concerns and committed to doing what is right by them. I have been given a back to shoulder burdens, not to turn it on the people I am representing.\nThe Star Democrat questionnaire was sent to all Easton Town Council candidates to allow them to share their perspective on various town issues in their own words. Responses may be edited for length and clarity. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

We want to go back every year and let our kids have these ideal summers, running around barefoot in the grass and swimming in the lake. It has a really wholesome feel that really resonates with us, and it's great to spend real time there.Q: How have you enjoyed working with your husband. actor Jonathan Silverman (\"Weekend at Bernie's\"), on A: He's one of the kindest, most generous people on the planet and if he's going to do something with me (professionally), I want our characters to be completely at odds with each other. Frankly, there's nothing more fun than when you've been in a long-term relationship with someone and you know them inside and out - and you don't fight with them much - to go at it with them on camera. I can't even tell you how cathartic it is.We see each other all the time, and part of a happy relationship is a healthy boundary. Many people have said to us over the years, \"Why don't you guys do a show together?\" Well, it's because I want us to stay married! One of the reasons The CW wanted this show is that Jonny is such a recognizable American actor, and I think that's a nice advantage.Q: How does that work for you yourself, in terms of being well-known in both the U.S. and your native CanadaftA: I think a lot of Canada doesn't even know I'm Canadian. I think I've done nine series at this point, and I've been on everyone's television for 24 years.Part of my excitement in doing this show initially was to boost my profile in Canada, because I have always been patriotic and proud to be a Canadian, though doing a strictly Canadian show is something I've very rarely done. In the way my character Lidia goes back home (in \"Moonshine\"), this was going back home for me as well. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Cristal explained that when you put pilings in, it's half in and half out, so at least 25 feet should be buried.\nWhen they are leaning, most likely they are cracked, she added.\nAnd Bramble pointed out no job is the same since the surface varies. Some surfaces are more sandy, or rocky, or like in parts up the river, there's mud.\nAlso there's the turbulence of the work. Waves are always pushing and pulling the boat and barge, which can lead to a highly dangerous situation. Workers could go overboard if not careful. The push barge with the excavator could tip, especially during the recreational months when people zoom by with speed boats and no consideration for the intricacy of their work.\nWhen the waves are too rough, they have no choice but to come to a complete stop and wait for waves to subside before going back to work.\"Our guys get frustrated,\" Cristal said. \"Summertime is not fun.\"\nDangerous, but in 41 years in the business, Bramble's had no incidents...knock on piling wood.\nAnd they stay busy all year round. After the Betterton job was completed at the end of June they were bound for Cecil County.\nBramble also keeps busy fielding questions from curious bystanders too who often stop and ask questions.\nHis wife of 26 years understands that fully, knowing the business in and out.\n\"What they do is pretty amazing,\" she said.\nFor a complete list of services they offer, visit www.bbpiledriving.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Larry Hogan, who has been one of former President Donald Trump's fiercest critics in the GOP, received Trump's endorsement in his Maryland Senate bid on Thursday in an interview on Fox News.\"I'd like to see him win,\" Trump told the network during a trip to Washington, D.C. \"I think he has a good chance to win.\"\nThe Maryland race could determine control of the Senate, a point Trump noted in the interview.\n\"I would like to see him win, and we got to take the majority. We have to straighten out our country, so I'd like to see him win,\" Trump said.\nHogan, who was a popular governor, is trying to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in Maryland, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 2-1 ratio statewide.\nLate last month, Hogan angered Trump's campaign when he said that the public should \"respect the verdict and the legal process\" prior to Trump's conviction by a Manhattan jury on 34 felony counts related to hush money payments.\n\"At this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders — regardless of party — must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship,\" Hogan posted on X before the verdict was announced. \"We must reaffirm what has made this nation great: the rule of law.\"\nChris LaCivita, a senior Trump campaign adviser, shot back on X: \"You just ended your campaign.\"\nHogan, who is trying to navigate a difficult path running in a heavily Democratic state, has said he will not be attending the Republican National Convention next month in Milwaukee, July 15-18. Hogan did not attend the party's conventions in 2020 and 2016.\nIn the past two presidential elections, Hogan said he did not vote for Trump, the party nominee. Hogan said he wrote in the name of his father, former U.S. Rep. Larry Hogan Sr., in 2016 and the late President Ronald Reagan in 2020.\nHogan is running against Democrat Angela Alsobrooks, the chief executive of Prince George's County near the nation's capital. The Senate seat is open due to the retirement of Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

They had a ribbon cutting to open the new field near Moton Park on May 11.\nLocated in Easton, the nonprofit provides scholarships, afterschool programing, summer camp, and more to empower at-risk youth in the community.\nA white tent full of local government officials listened to different speakers at a podium set up right in front of the field.\nFrank Gunsallus, president of the Easton Town Council, said, \"I want to extend special thanks to everyone involved in making this project a reality. From our dedicated town staff to our numerous community volunteers and generous sponsors.\"\nThe small crowd of officials clapped as the colors were raised on either side of the podium.\n\"Let's continue to support and invest in our parks and recreational facilities to ensure that Easton remains a vibrant and engaging community for everyone,\" Gunsallus said.\nDel. Tom Hutchison (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) came up to the microphone.\nHutchison said, \"You have done such great things for the community. This is a great addition for the children and youths that are here.\"\nHe presented citations to BAAM for U.S. Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin honoring BAAM's 20 years of service.\nMautz said, \"If you had been standing here 20 or 30 years ago, you wouldn't recognize where we are standing. I am looking forward to everybody kicking soccer balls out here.\"\nThe sound of DJ Hector could be heard in the distance as Amy Kreiner, president of the Talbot County Chamber of Commerce, came to the microphone to give a glass award to BAAM.\n\"It is my honor to present Derek and Dina Daily with this 20th Anniversary plaque on behalf of the Talbot County Chamber of Commerce and blessings for the next 20 years,\" Kreiner said.\nThen they stepped onto the pitch for a large red ribbon cutting to open the field up.\nWilliam Ryan is president of the board of directors for BAAM. He was smiling as he wore a BAAM sweatshirt.\n\"We want to get our kids out playing as much as possible. It is part of the town park. It is open to all. If you want to have an event, you have to check with the town. We started out small and we have just been steadily growing,\" Ryan said.\nThere were members of the construction crew that actually built the field. It was a lot more than siting a rectangle. Lucas Lees, coastal and land designer of Unity Landscapes, had a three man crew that got the drainage on the field just right.\n\"We ran into water lines we weren't expecting, but since we were putting in irrigation it was convenient that the town already owned them. It really transformed this space and completed the park,\" Lees said.\nUnity Landscape built it in 45 days.\nDerick Daly, founder of BAAM, said that key is being long-term. The relationship with the town, the donors and the staff were all long-term.\n\"We wanted a place where kids could come and call it their own. We are opening up the soccer field with the partnership of the town of Easton developing with this field for youth soccer. Come out here and just have fun. Play and enjoy yourself, get out and exercise. This could be an incubator for kids to get exposure and take it to another level,\" Daly said.\nLooking past the new soccer field, there was BAAM Fest going on closer to the community pool. There were 31 community partners, whose colorful tents lined a winding sidewalk.\n\"We started BAAM Fest to give out information about what we are doing. It turned into offering a meal to everyone. We have free lunch for everyone. We have a band as you can hear, face painting — the kids love it. We have community partners,\" Daly said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Tench Tilghman: A Talbot County-born revolutionary hero\n\n October 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 795\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — One of George Washington's most trusted men has roots in Talbot County, and this week he was celebrated by a local chapter of the Maryland Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.The SAR's Colonel Tench Tilghman Chapter honored its namesake after receiving proclamations from Easton and Talbot County for the inaugural Tench Tilghman Week from Oct. 19 to 24.\nTilghman, born in Talbot County in 1744 and educated there during his youth, was a primary aide-de-camp for Washington during the Revolutionary War. Wes Hagood, chapter president, has deeply researched Tilghman and his critical role as one of Washington's right-hand men.\nIn 1776, Tilghman joined Washington's staff. Washington often referred to him as \"family\" in written letters, Hagood said.\n\"He became, in a lot of ways, like a son to Washington,\" Hagood said. \"… They carried on a relationship until Tilghman died.\"\nTilghman's calling card was his duty of delivering the notice of British surrender following the Battle of Yorktown. Surrender came on Oct. 19, 1781, and Tilghman arrived in Philadelphia on Oct. 24 to confirm the news to the Continental Congress.\n\"It's probably one of his most recognizable accomplishments,\" Hagood said.\nHagood described Tilghman as \"hard working\" and smart, adding that he \"probably would have had a role in the future government had he lived.\" He provided leadership to patriot soldiers and often was responsible for finding food to sustain the troops, Hagood said.\nIn a letter to Continental Army General John Sullivan in 1781, Washington spoke highly of Tilghman.\n\"This gentleman came out a captain of one of the light infantry companies of Philadelphia, and served in the flying camp in 1776,\" Washington wrote. \"In August of the same year he joined my family, and has been in every action in which the main army was concerned. He has been a zealous servant and slave to the public, and a faithful assistant to me for nearly five years, a great part of which time he refused pay.\"\nFollowing the victory, a portrait of Washington was commissioned in 1781, depicting Tilghman and Marquis de Lafayette. Maryland-born Charles Willson Peale painted the portrait, which is displayed today in the Maryland State House.\nTilghman died in 1786, leaving behind his spouse, who spent many decades thereafter in Oxford on Tilghman's father's plantation. Today, Tilghman is buried at the Oxford Cemetery after being reinterred in 1971 from his original burial site in Baltimore.\nMARYLAND 400\nHagood, who has read all of the letters Tench Tilghman wrote to his father during the war, pointed out the Talbot County native's critical role in the Battle of Brooklyn in 1776. At that battle, a larger and more experienced British army posed a significant threat to patriot troops.\nOwen Lourie, \"Finding the Maryland 400\" project director at the Maryland State Archives, calls that the \"first major battle.\" Lourie says the troops known as the Maryland 400, along with some from Pennsylvania and Delaware, reformed to attack the enemy after a damaging British charge.\nWhile there were massive casualties, Lourie says the Maryland 400 \"bottled up\" the British and prevented them from delivering a \"final death blow\" to the other continental soldiers that were escaping.\n\"It is probably not too much of an exaggeration to say that they saved the Continental Army,\" Lourie said.\nWitness to the heroic efforts, Tilghman applauded the Col. William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Regiment, Lourie notes. \"No Regular Troops ever made a more gallant Resistance than Smallwood's Regiment,\" Tilghman wrote in a memoir.\nLourie and the Maryland State Archives are working to identify and write biographies on as many of those soldiers as possible. There were more than 1,000 Maryland troops, and his historian work has helped identify over 800. He says he's focused on \"telling the small stories\" of those Marylanders that may not have been thought of in hundreds of years.\nLourie is presenting a history of the Maryland 400 at the Talbot County Free Library on Saturday at 11 a.m., an event sponsored by the Tench Tilghman Chapter which wraps up Tench Tilghman Week.\nDana Newman, library director, says registration is open online at tcfl.org, with limited spots remaining. It will also be livestreamed on Talbot Library's YouTube channel.\nHagood is excited for Tench Tilghman Week to return next October and for years to come.\n\"What better way would there be for us as a chapter to fulfill our mission of educating current and future generations about all of this than to have a week dedicated to Colonel Tench Tilghman,\" Hagood said. \"And this year, just start with one event. But the idea is, we'll do this every year.\"\nFollowing the Maryland 400 presentation on Saturday, a free program on how to join the Sons of the American Revolution and Daughters of the American Revolution will be held at the Talbot County Free Library from 2 to 4 p.m. in the Frederick Douglass Room. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There was BBQ chicken being prepared by the hunky stepping dance troupe from Omega Psi Phi. With every flip of the chicken, these fraternity brothers came up with more highly aerobic, synchronized dance moves. It was like going into a '90s soul video with the smoky sweet smell of chicken.\"Stepping is something we all do to get together to unify us. It is mainly an uplift for events. This is our fourth year doing this. It puts us out there in the community.We do a scholarship.We all believe in education.All these guys are from the Eastern Shore and went to UMES or Salisbury,\" said Albert C. Jones Jr., or \"Queban.\" He said they were not done and will all get together to hop.One festivalgoer tried to sum it all up and thank some sponsors.Veronica Taylor, president of Groove City Black Heritage and Cultural Group Inc., said, \"It will be a rockin' party. If you weren't here, you should have seen the phenomenal performance by the Universal African Dance and Ensemble. A great performance.We started preparing for this in April. We get funding from grants, the city of Cambridge, the Elks Lodge and the Maryland Heritage Way. We get support from throughout the community like Dorchester Center for the Arts.\" \"My favorite part is seeing all the vendors on the street.We started in 2018. Five years. I want to thank the community for trusting in us to provide a good cultural experience for them,\" said Taylor as she looked over at a broken generator that was supposed to power the live stage. The large trailer mounted generator was not turning over, but they got it going after trying to jump it with a yellow van.On a more serious note, getting a solid education is the key to prosperity and the ability to give back to the community. It makes leaders in a community.Victoria Jackson-Stanley, former mayor of Cambridge, is a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, which is a service based group. She was wearing the red and black colors of her sorority.\"We are a public service organization. We are here to pass out information about the mission of Delta Sigma Theta. We are part of the Cambridge alumni chapter.Scholarship, service and sisterhood those are our motto,\" said Jackson-Stanley.Lois McCord president of Delta Sigma Theta said, \"We do get out the vote. We work with young girls in our community.We offer scholarships for college.\" Not only could the community shake it and have a good time, they could also find vital resources to help make life a little better.This festival had it all including the smell of funnel cakes frying. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/TMCCA LL@CHESPUB.COM\n \nFood was a huge factor in the fun of Groove City Culture Fest.

Addressing that deficit meant Dorchester County schools lost after-school and summer programming.\nThe cuts to education come at a time when the county ranks 21st out of 24 school districts (including Baltimore City) in third grade literacy and 22nd out of 24 in overall English Language Arts proficiency in the state.\nThe Y is partnering with the John and Janice Wyatt Foundation to create a space for the Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading, a campaign that aims to target childhood illiteracy.\n{span}The campaign was inspired by the movie \"Sentenced,\" which was produced and narrated by NBA champion Stephen Curry. The film explores the epidemic of childhood illiteracy and its lifelong impacts.{/span}\n\"Dorchester County has, for a long time, been ranked very low in the state of Maryland,\" said Matthew Peterson, executive director of the John and Janice Wyatt Foundation. \"And so interestingly, now concurrent to all the work that the Y is doing, that we're all doing together, Dorchester County Public Schools is undergoing a strategic plan to go from 21st, to 15.\"\nThe Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading plans to approach this goal from multiple angles and with multiple partnerships.\nBecause third grade is a pivotal marker for childhood learning development, the campaign's target population are children from birth to age 5, so they are better prepared to enter kindergarten, and are less likely to fall behind.\n\"So we're trying to grab moms as prenatal because we're gonna do infant groups, we're gonna do, you know, toddler groups, mommy and me groups, so we want to bring awareness at early childhood,\" said Tynice DeShields, director of mental health at the YMCA of Chesapeake.\nThe campaign's partners include county schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson, the Dorchester County Public Library, United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, Operation Pathways and volunteers from the community.\n\"There's a number of agencies we've been working with over the years. You know, as any organization, some were more engaged than others, and so bringing everybody on board, finding out where that alignment fits best, and then trying to leverage that, to do the best we can, is what we've always tried to have,\" Peterson said.\nThe reading hub will be a space that is open to the public and YMCA members alike.\n\"We're building this reading hub as a meeting place where we can have a resource center, we can have meetings with the community, we can have sessions with the parents to teach their kids how to read, how to look at letters and numbers, and not just throw a book in front of them,\" said Bryant Wittington, director of the Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading.\nPeterson, DeShields and Wittington are excited to engage with the community and hope to build a strong foundation of volunteers at the reading hub.\n\"We want to build that unity in the community,\" Wittington said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Coopersmith recounted his journey as a community college graduate over 40 years ago.\nIn his speech, he referenced two themes he wanted to share with the graduates: the first acknowledges the extraordinary times they are living through, and the second theme is the hope that the graduates embody.\n\"I wish to focus on all of you, our first cohort of students graduating with degrees and certificates that were impacted the most by the immediate and following effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Coppersmith said. \"You have persevered in the most difficult times we have seen as a nation in decades, and your decision to pursue your education, to quote a colleague of mine, Dr. David Harper, is a sign of hope, in and of itself.\"\nAn array of individuals were honored, including Rob Thompson, current director of arts for Chesapeake College, who received the 2024-2026 Bounds Distinguished Teaching Chair Award.\nIn Thompson's speech, he spoke of Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for president in 1872, and her dedication to her dream for a more equal society. He described her as a pioneer for women's rights.\n\"Woodhull never asked for permission to try and change the world or to embark on any of the careers she took up,\" Thompson said. \"She felt an injustice, she found a purpose, and she took action in as many ways as she could think of. For as long as she could stand, it would all be a national figure. But as her story shows, she was just as focused on changing conditions in her home as she was on the nation.\"\nThompson described the importance of shaping homes and communities and the power that adapting after failure has on people.\n\"That's not so much persisting as it is adapting and seeking an alternative,\" Thompson said. \"Chasing dreams requires that you travel down some dark and twisting trails. But you've got to keep searching. My student's dreams and their remarkable capacity to show up with creative minds and passionate hearts have carried me through this career. I'm talking about you guys.\"\nAfter Thompson's speech, Milton Nagel, vice chair of the Chesapeake College Board of Trustees, presented the John T. Harrison Award to Zulema Delacruz Martinez. The John T. Harrison Award is given each year to a student who has demonstrated the highest academic performance, leadership and overall contributions to the college and the community.\nDelacruz Martinez was praised for her commitment to Hispanic and Latino students within the region who are interested in college but may be intimidated by the academic process. She has organized several events to welcome the students and their families to complete college applications and sign up for resource services.\nDuring her speech, Delacruz Martinez recounted her childhood growing up in a nontraditional home and witnessing the extraordinary hard work that her mother had to do to provide for her and her brother.\n\"My mother overcame so many obstacles while making so many sacrifices. It was then, at the age of 8, that I vowed to do the same. I decided I would learn from her experience of having a front-row seat to my mother's hardships as she overcame her adversities. All of those experiences have pushed me to persevere.\"\nShe recounted the resources her advisers gave her and the many people who helped guide and support her to finish. During her time at Chesapeake College, she founded the Hispanic Latino Student Union, learned to be a leader and found her home there.\nToward the end of her speech, Delacruz Martinez praised her classmates and offered words of encouragement.\n\"Take advantage of every opportunity that comes your way. Build upon meaningful relationships with those around you and keep persevering as you keep persevering. Whether that be in your future college endeavors or in your day-to-day lives,\" Delacruz Martinez said. \"I leave you with this quote: 'To make a great dream a reality. The first requirement is a great capacity to dream. The second is persistence.'\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wilson, 59, on Thursday, police announced.The charges, which include acting as an accessory, altering physical evidence and obstructing and hindering a police officer, stem from Wilson's alleged involvement after the shooting death of Easton resident Ty A. Brooks in early August.Police responded to the area of 104 Blake Street around 7 p.m. Aug. 7 for a report of a person who had been shot and was laying in the grass.Officers arriving on scene rendered aid to the man, later identified as Brooks, until paramedics arrived. Brooks died from his injuries at the scene, police said. He was transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore for an autopsy.Police said earlier in the day, Brooks argued with individuals that were near and operating a 2018 Land Rover Range Rover, which was parked in the 100 block of Blake Street.Brooks left the area and returned later, operating an ATV. Brooks confronted the same individuals with a shotgun, police said.Police said after the group exchanged words, a man seated in the driver's seat of the Range Rover fired shots through the front passenger seat window and struck Brooks' side.The man in the driver's seat was identified by police as Daseir Cornish, 22, of Denton. Cornish is charged with second-degree murder, assault, manslaughter and related charges in connection to Brooks' death.After Brooks was shot, he fell off of the ATV, police said. The Range Rover fled the scene accompanied by a gray Hyundai sedan.Police said Thursday that when officers were attempting to secure the crime scene and render aid, Wilson walked to the area where Cornish allegedly shot Brooks and retrieved his cell phone, which was dropped by Cornish. Wilson left the area with the phone, police said.Wilson was released on a $25,000 unsecured bond, according to online court records. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Even those who wake up and decide to participate that day can get in on the action and register at the walk.When Pam Clark Edwards of Centreville, was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in February 2021, her family and friends not only rallied around her, they lost no time launching the effort to raise funds for the ALS Association.Edwards' daughters, Meredith Kulbacki of Centreville and Morgan Edwards of Winter Garden, Florida, spearheaded the Oct. 2022 Walk that rallied some 140 people who walked, ran and wheeled to raise over $30,000.Their team, Pam's Praying Pineapples, will be joined by 10 additional teams this year.As of the beginning of October, the local walk had raised over 80% of its goal.\"That's pretty amazing,\" Kulbacki said. \"I think we can definitely get close to that, if not reach it by the walk.\" The community has reached out to help. Other fundraising in the form of raffles and a 50/50 drawing will be held, and about 40 items were donated by local businesses.For example, \"we have a foursome golf outing at Queenstown Harbor, an official NFLfootball signed by Justin Tucker of the Baltimore Ravens, a gift basket from Draper Brothers liquor store, cosmetic gift bags, jewelry and various services,\" Meredith said.Fun activities include pumpkin decorating for kids.The ALS chapter from D.C., Maryland and Virginia will be sending helpers to be stationed at tables, so people can find out more information about ALS itself, and maybe about how they can help, Kulbacki said.\"If they have become a caretaker to someone with ALS,\" she said. \"There will be workers there to help them through that.\" Information will be available for people who have been diagnosed with ALS.In fact, some members of Edwards' care team at Johns Hopkins will be attending the walk Ebb Tide Tent & Party Rentals in Queenstown donated a large tent, while Queen Anne's County Parks and Recreation donated the use of the park.Community support has been \"just amazing,\" Edwards said.\"Having the support of the community helps us as a family deal with all of this,\" she said.The Clark family has deep roots in the county. Pam and her husband, Fred, and Kulbacki and her family live on the family farm just down the road from the park where the walk will be held.Pam is a retired teacher in Queen Anne's County Public Schools.Pam's mother, June, and her brother Jeff have canvassed local business owners, who are supporting their longtime neighbors.Edwards' longtime friends and colleagues are part of the small committee helping her daughters. Connie Dean, Barb Thompson and Bobbie King have rallied around the Edwards family to help out where they can to help organize the walk.Kulbacki, who was raised in Centreville, spent eight years in York, Pennsylvania, and recently moved back. \"It means everything to me. It means family,\" she said.During the COVID pandemic, she and her family, which includes her husband and two children, decided to move back home \"on a whim.\" \"We felt so alone with just no family and (few) friends there,\" she said. \"We had no idea that this would happen.We say it was almost like God told us. He helped us through this, and it was almost a blessing in disguise that we moved home, so that we could help my mom and my dad and my family through this.\" \"So not only to be here with them, and then also to have so much support from everybody in the community and all of our friends and family - it's just amazing and we're so thankful for that,\" Mer said.Kulbacki knew about the ALS Association's Walk to Defeat ALS through a sad coincidence. The mother of a close friend in Pennsylvania died from ALS about a year before the Kulbackis moved to Maryland, and Kulbacki had participated in a Pennsylvania Walk in memory of Becky Miller's mom.\"I didn't know that it would affect me so deeply a year later, so it's been amazing to still be friends with her and have support from her because she knows what I'm going through,\" Mer said.\"You never know when ALS may affect a friend or family member,\" Edwards said. \"It is becoming, I think, more prevalent. I know five people who have passed away from it, not because I have been in this situation - these are people who have been in my life.\" \"It's a disease that they really do not have a treatment or cure for yet, and we just need to put money into the resources for help for these families, as well as to provide money for research,\" she said.To register online for the Oct. 22 Walk, visit Walkto-DefeatALS.org.For more information about the ALS Association, donating your time or resources and supporting the Walk to Defeat ALS Chesapeake Bay, visit als.org or contact coordinator Tara Huang at tara.huang@als.org. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTeam Chesapeake Bay is ready to lead the Walk to Defeat ALS Oct. 22.

    "title": "EDITORIAL: 10-cent paper bag fee should be optional",
    "date": "2024-09-07",

    "content": "EDITORIAL: 10-cent paper bag fee should be optional\n\n September 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editorials \n \n 923\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier this week, the Easton Town Council debated a proposal to remove a 10-cent fee on paper bags used to bag groceries and other purchased merchandise.We think that fee should be optional — if retailers need to charge the fee to cover the cost of the bags, they should be able to do so. But it is also important that store owners be able to provide the bags at no charge as part of the service they offer customers.\nThe April 2023 Easton ordinance banning the use of plastic bags required retailers to charge customers a fee of at least 10 cents for each paper bag used, encouraging shoppers to bring reusable bags. It came as the Town Council banned the use of plastic bags for packaging purchases in stores such as groceries and retail shops. Restaurants and food establishments are exempt from the ban.\nThis is a hot topic in Eastern Shore communities.\nLate last month, the Commissioners of Oxford debated a similar ban for Oxford before tabling the proposed ordinance.\nLike it does in Easton, Oxford Town Attorney Lyndsey Ryan said the Oxford ban would apply to retail establishments including grocery stores, convenience stores, shops, department stores and service stations. The ordinance would not apply to restaurants and food service establishments.\nDuring the Oxford public hearing, some business owners and employees expressed concerns with the proposed ordinance. Graham Norbury, the general manager at Safe Harbor Oxford, said that while this may be a national issue, he doesn't observe plastic bags being littered often in Oxford.\n\"Why is restricting a retailer's right to choose the best delivery mechanism for their products, why is that something that the commissioners feel necessary?\" he asked.\nOxford Vintage and Trade owner Barbara Ranson said in her six years of being in business in Oxford, she has always used paper bags. She said she doesn't understand why the commissioners are looking at this legislation when \"it may or may not target three very small businesses.\"\nWe think Oxford should follow in Easton's footsteps and ban plastic bags and even expand the ban to include restaurants and food service establishments.\nPlastic bags have severe and dire affects on the environment.\nNon-biodegradable: Plastic bags can take hundreds of years to break down in the environment. Instead of decomposing, they break into smaller pieces called microplastics, which can persist in the ecosystem for even longer.\nPollution: Plastic bags often end up in waterways and oceans, where they can cause severe pollution. Marine animals can ingest or become entangled in plastic bags, leading to injury or death.\nHarmful chemicals: As plastic bags break down, they can release harmful chemicals into the soil and water, which can contaminate ecosystems and pose risks to wildlife and human health.\nEnergy and resources: The production of plastic bags involves the use of fossil fuels and energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion.\nWaste management: Plastic bags can be challenging to recycle due to their lightweight and flimsy nature. They can clog machinery at recycling facilities, leading to higher costs and lower recycling rates.\nJust this week a Star Democrat editor watched a plastic grocery bag go airborne from the bed of a pickup truck crossing the Bay Bridge. The bag floated into the air where a breeze caught it and sent it flying over the Bay, eventually landing in the water. That bag became a death trap for a fish or a bird. This is not an isolated incident, we are sure readers can recount similar experiences seeing wayward plastic bags.\nSo we stand firmly behind banning plastic bags and think more towns should follow the lead of Easton and Oxford.\nOur complaint comes with the imposition of a 10-cent fee that Easton requires retailers to charge a fee if a customer requests or needs a plastic bag.\nThere is a good reason for that fee: It provides an incentive for customers to begin using reusable bags, which are far better than even the paper bags.\n\"The reason for the proposal to remove this fee comes directly from the voices of many Easton residents who are feeling its impact,\" said council President Frank Gunsallus in explaining the proposal to make the fee optional, \"especially those in lower-income brackets who are already stretching every dollar to make ends meet.\"\nGunsallus and Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery both said they've talked to residents who do not support the current 10-cent fee. The rest of the council, though, stated otherwise.\n\"I have heard from many people the exact opposite, that the ban is working and that the 10 cents is not onerous in any way, shape or form,\" Ward 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry said.\nWard 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello and Ward 4 Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis stated the fee has incentivized people to bring their own reusable bags. Abbatiello said, \"the reason for that (fee) is because paper bags pollute just as much as plastic bags do.\"\nAll valid arguments on both sides of the issue. Our thought is that this is an issue that should be left to individual retailers to decide what is best for their businesses.\nNearly everybody from the audience who spoke at Tuesday's council meeting supported leaving the mandatory fee in place.\nEaston resident Shari Wilcoxon held a different stance, questioning why the businesses are forced to charge the 10-cent fee.\n\"I don't know why people are afraid of freedom of choice,\" Wilcoxon said. \"Why don't you let the merchants decide if they want to charge or not, what's wrong with that?\"\nWe agree with Wilcoxon and hope town council members look to making the fee optional when the issue is discussed again on Sept. 16. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Turner Classic Movies shows the picture Thursday, Sept. 14, to lead a memorial salute to Friedkin, who died in August.He won an Oscar for the fact-inspired 1971 police thriller (named its year's best picture at the awards), as did Gene Hackman as \"Popeye\" Doyle, a tough New York detective determined to get the goods on a seemingly untouchable international drug smuggler (Fernando Rey). Roy Scheider also attained stardom as Doyle's partner, and while there's much else to recommend about the movie, the chase that puts a wild-driving Doyle on the trail of an overload train is a highlight that's hard to beat.

He proposed that the council should hold off on any action on this letter to allow time for a thorough review of the draft language.\nHe suggested waiting until council member Haythe could weigh in who was not in attendance at the meeting.\nA date was not set for discussion of the letter. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lions rally for first Bayside title; Caroline boys defend throne\n\n May 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 838\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Queen Anne's County High's No. 3 girls doubles team of Sydney Pinder and Kara Ringold were down 4-1 when head coach Dee Fisher approached.\"I asked them, 'Hey, are you guys having fun?'\" Fisher said. \"And they were like, 'No. We're not.' I was like, 'You guys need to go out there and have fun and relax.' Just the things you can say to kids, and nothing tennis related, and it just made them relax.\"\nPinder and Ringold rallied to win, then watched Hayden Legg rally for a clinching victory at No. 3 singles Tuesday, May 7, helping Queen Anne's defeat Stephen Decatur, 4-3, at Washington College for its first Bayside Conference championship in girls tennis.\nWhile the Lions were winning their first title, North Caroline's boys were winning a second straight conference crown, topping James M. Bennett, 4-3, to cap a perfect 15-0 season.\n\"We lost one match last season,\" Bulldogs second-year boys head coach James Donelan said. \"It was their goal to go undefeated this year. And we were able to do that, which was huge.\nWe had a couple of close matches at the end of the season that just took some real grit to pull out and some real mental toughness from our boys,\" Donelan said of a 4-3 win at St. Michaels on April 24 and a 4-3 victory over Easton in the regular-season finale May 1. \"It was really impressive to watch. Their growth and their ability to face adversity, face everybody coming at you, giving you their best every single night and just finding a way to win.\"\nThe Bulldogs did that again against the South champion Clippers.\nNorth Caroline's No. 1 singles team of Josh Huster and Jesse Link defeated Cypress Schnatterly and Joe Chen, 9-7, while Ryan Canter and Hayden Kent beat Bennett's Daniel Ryu and Mason Layne, 8-4, in second doubles. But the Clippers avoided a double sweep, when Shafay Qaiser and Rishi Kandagatla earned an 8-5 win over Gavin O'Brien and Yossin Roblero-Velasquez at No. 3.\nIt remained close, as Bennett's Chen defeated Link, 8-5, at second singles, and Ryu outlasted Canter, 9-7 at No. 3. But Roblero-Velasquez rolled to an 8-1 victory over Landon Blumenthal at No. 4. Huster, who last year teamed with Rebecca White to win the Class 2A state mixed doubles title — North Caroline's first-ever state tennis title of any kind — clinched the victory against Bennett and the perfect record with an 8-3 victory over Schnatterly at No. 1.\n\"Going into this season, after the success that we had last year, we were definitely very confident,\" Donelan said. \"We knew it wasn't going to be handed to us. We knew that everybody was going to be putting a target on our back, and that they knew we only graduated one senior and then all these boys were returning.\"\nUnlike Donelan, Fisher entered the season thinking rebuild after graduating nine seniors from a year ago. Instead, the Lions went unbeaten in the North and 13-1 overall, with the lone loss coming against Decatur.\nAnd while Queen Anne's drew a rematch with the Seahawks for the Bayside championship, Fisher didn't want his team deviating from its usual approach.\n\"Just treat it like a regular match and have fun,\" Fisher said to his team.\nThe Lions' No. 1 doubles team of Lucy Taylor and younger sister Meg Taylor lost 8-6 to Decatur's Ana Pena and Emily Ferguson. But Queen Anne's Hayden Legg and Marylee Kline beat Brooke Berquist and Kalli Nordstrom, 8-2, at No. 2, while Pinder and Ringold erased their 4-1 deficit en route to an 8-6 victory over Anika Karl and Emmie Weber at No. 3.\nThe Seahawks moved to a 3-2 lead, when Pena defeated Lucy Taylor, 8-2 at first singles, and Ferguson earned an 8-2 win over Meg Taylor at No. 2. Kline tied the match at 3-3 with her 8-6 win over Nordstrom at No. 4.\nThat left No. 3 singles, where Karl built a 4-1 lead on Legg. Again Fisher spoke with his player.\n\"I was like, 'Come on Hayden. You can play better,'\" Fisher said. \"'Focus. Take your time.' And basically she just started turning it around.\"\nLegg did turn it around, rallying for an 8-6 title-clinching victory.\n\"I was like, 'It's going to be tough,'\" Fisher said. \"She's like the most chill person. She just kept coming back and coming back.\"\nYet after Legg had completed her comeback to seal the title, nobody from Queen Anne's stormed the court or hoisted their teammate onto their shoulders for a victory lap.\n\"Nobody got excited,\" Fisher said. \"We just all like took it all in, like, 'Good job Hayden.'\" Fisher said. \"I think that's just the mentality of our team. We treat it like a regular match. We just do what we do.\n\"It felt even better because we lost to Decatur during the regular season,\" Fisher said. \"Hey we fixed our wrongs, made some corrections and won it.\"\nWhat Fisher wasn't expecting came next.\n\"They were like, 'Come here coach Fisher and take a picture,'\" Fisher said. \"And then they started spraying me with silly string. It was fun.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Number of Cambridge homicides down in 2023\n\n January 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 743\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — There were less than half as many homicides in Cambridge in 2023 compared to the year before.In 2022, Cambridge saw seven homicides. In 2023, it saw three.\nCambridge Police Chief Justin Todd, who was sworn in as chief in January of 2023, called the difference progress. He credits the decrease in homicides to a few different things — namely, how the department polices and its partnerships with other agencies.\nOne of the police department's top priorities last year was community-oriented policing. For Todd, that meant being a part of the community that the department services.\nHe said getting out into neighborhoods and creating programs like neighborhood watches can help build relationships and trust in communities and, hopefully, reduce crime.\nAlong with prioritizing community policing, Todd said that the department has tried to be proactive in addressing gun violence and aggressive assaults. He said CPD is now taking an average of one gun off the street each week, \"well more than double\" the average in 2022.\nTodd also stressed the importance of working with other agencies and working with the community. He said that being a part of the Dorchester County Task Force, getting support from Cambridge City Council and focusing on community-oriented policing has all made a difference.\n\"I think a lot of people have come to the table in the last year,\" he said.\nCambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout said this decrease in the number of homicides in Cambridge is a significant one.\n\"Every shooting that we can stop is a step in the right direction,\" he said.\nRideout said he thinks CPD's community policing efforts are part of the reason for that success.\n\"It's just started, but I think they're building a trust within the community that just did not exist before now,\" he said.\nLieutenant Kyle Clark with Maryland State Police's Homicide Unit said that although he can't say for certain why the number of homicides has gone down in Cambridge, he can say that there has been a focus on collaboration between agencies.\n\"We do concentrate on a lot of collaborative efforts with other units within the State Police and also allied agencies,\" he said, specifying the use of task forces, gang units and gun units. \"And those are all tools that we use to combat the crime in any city.\"\nClark said that he would estimate about 50% of the homicides in the last two years in Cambridge have been gang-related. He said that in addressing gang violence, MSP, along with other agencies at all levels, do \"everything and anything\" to combat the gang violence.\nTodd said CPD is working to identify gang members and groups that are \"constantly harassing\" residents in different Cambridge neighborhoods. He said they have worked with the different agencies within the Dorchester County Task Force as well as federal agencies to identify who is bringing in handguns and where they are coming from.\n\"The partnership's been great with the Task Force and Maryland State Police,\" he said. \"The Homicide Unit with Maryland State Police — they handle all of our homicides. So we work hand in hand together. And that's what it's going to take.\"\nTodd said he has noticed gun violence and homicide rates begin to fall throughout the country.\nSpecific data on other crime rates in Cambridge should be released to the public in the next couple of weeks, Todd said.\nRideout said early intervention is important when it comes to crime prevention. Rideout was recently at a meeting about a flag football initiative by CPD and the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services.\n\"It was really an exciting possibility of where we can really start focusing, not only on the crime itself, but on the prevention and early intervention,\" he said.\nRideout added that engaging children in education and outside activities, such as programming at the YMCA or Boys and Girls Club, can have a positive effect.\nGoing into 2024, CPD's goals include continuing to build its manpower, focusing on data-driven technology and \"patrolling with a purpose.\"\nTodd said \"patrolling with a purpose\" means putting officers in the areas where crimes are occurring on the specific days and at the specific times they have been occurring.\nHe said that residents can also expect to see more data from CPD in the new year, including heat maps of where crimes are occurring.\nRegarding homicides, Rideout said the downward trend is good, but added that the work doesn't stop here.\n\"What we have to do is continue working on it and engage the community in working on it to hopefully keep these numbers down,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The cat was turned into the Humane Society, which then contacted the Caroline County Health Department's Environmental Health Division to facilitate rabies testing.Any person in the vicinity of Legion Road should avoid contact with wildlife, feral cats, unknown animals and any animal (including cats or dogs) that appears sick or to exhibit signs of rabies. Additionally, all residents in the area are urged to make sure their pets and mammal livestock are up to date on rabies vaccinations.\nTo report a potentially rabid animal, contact Animal Control at (410) 820-1600 or the non-emergency line of the 911 Center at (410) 479-2222.\nPlease contact the Caroline County Health Department immediately if you have had, or may know of anyone who might have had, any possible human or animal exposure to a rabid animal at (410) 479-8045.\nIf you have an emergency regarding a potential rabid animal or exposure and are calling after normal business hours or on the weekend, call (410) 829-5910.\nAn exposure can mean contamination of open wounds, abrasions, mucous membranes or scratches by potentially contaminated with infectious material from a rabid animal.\nAdditionally, any penetration of the skin by teeth constitutes a bite exposure. All bites, regardless of body site, represent a potential risk of rabies transmission, but that risk varies with the species of biting animal, the site of the bite and the severity of the wound.\nRabies is a serious, but preventable viral disease that attacks the nervous system. It is predominantly seen in raccoons, bats and skunks, as well as dogs and cats.\nAll wild or unknown animals must be avoided whenever possible since the possibility of exposure to rabies can occur anywhere and anytime.\nPet owners should remember that the best way to protect themselves, their families and their pets is to keep their animals up to date on rabies vaccination.\nThe Health Department regularly offers low-cost rabies clinics to help residents protect their pets. The next clinic will be held in the spring. Please monitor the Health Department's Events Calendar for more information.\nFor more information about rabies, visit CDC's Rabies Prevention webpage at cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/index.html. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
