# Narrative Guide: Baltimore/Maryland Sports and High School NIL

## Overview

This guide covers major themes in Baltimore and Maryland sports journalism, with particular emphasis on Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) developments in high school athletics, professional sports developments, and local sports culture. The reporting reveals significant policy shifts, economic impacts, and ongoing debates about youth sports.

## Key Geographic Areas

**Baltimore**: Home to the Orioles (MLB) and Ravens (NFL), Camden Yards, and a rich sports history. The city faces ongoing challenges with attendance and economic development tied to sports.

**Washington D.C. Metro Area**: Includes the Nationals (MLB), Commanders (NFL), Capitals (NHL), and numerous high school athletic powerhouses. This region is at the center of NIL policy debates.

**Maryland Suburbs**: Prince George's County, Montgomery County, and Howard County contain many elite high school programs referenced in NIL coverage, including DeMatha Catholic, Good Counsel, and Bishop McNamara.

**College Park**: Home to University of Maryland athletics, particularly relevant for football, basketball, and women's sports coverage.

## Major Ongoing Stories

### 1. High School NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness)

**What is NIL?**: In December 2022, Maryland changed rules to allow high school athletes to profit from endorsement deals using their name, image, and likeness. This represents a significant shift in amateur athletics.

**Key Developments**:
- Alexis Ewing (volleyball player from Bullis School) became **one of the first Maryland high school athletes** to sign an NIL deal with College Hunks Hauling Junk & Moving in April 2023
- The deal was reportedly worth compensation (exact amount undisclosed) and came through family connections
- Kiyomi McMiller (Silver Spring native, now at Life Center Academy in NJ) became **the first high school athlete to sign with Jordan Brand** in February 2023

**National Context** (Critical for Maryland reporters):
The Povich Center conducted a **major national poll** revealing:
- 54% of Americans support high school athletes earning money through endorsements
- Support is **significantly higher among Black (73%) and Hispanic (74%) respondents** than white respondents (23%)
- Black and Hispanic parents are nearly **twice as likely** as white parents to see youth football as a path to college scholarships and NFL careers

**Undercovered Angles**:

1. **Implementation gaps**: While Maryland allows NIL, there's limited reporting on:
   - How many Maryland high school athletes actually have deals (beyond the few high-profile examples)
   - What Maryland schools are doing to educate athletes and parents about NIL rules
   - Whether Maryland's policy is attracting or retaining athletes compared to neighboring states

2. **The education component**: The poll found 70% of parents don't know basic facts about youth athlete head impacts. Are schools providing NIL education? What's the quality?

3. **The Delaware factor**: Delaware only implemented NIL in October 2024. **Follow-up needed**: Are Maryland schools losing athletes to Delaware or other states with different rules? DIAA Executive Director David Baylor mentioned concerns about potential transfers.

4. **Social media literacy**: Stories note that PointsBet and other companies use TikTok and Instagram to reach young audiences. **Investigate**: Are Maryland high schools teaching athletes about social media management, brand building, or the risks of certain endorsements?

5. **Enforcement and violations**: Maryland requires notification within 72 hours of signing NIL deals. **Unclear**: Who's enforcing this? Have there been violations? What are the penalties?

6. **Economic reality check**: The stories showcase deals with national brands (Nike, Jordan), but local/regional Maryland businesses may offer more realistic opportunities. **Story idea**: Profile Maryland small businesses considering or avoiding NIL deals—why or why not?

## Key People to Know

### High School NIL Figures

**Alexis Ewing**: Volleyball player, Bullis School (Potomac, MD), committed to Penn State. First Maryland high school NIL athlete. Her mother Cheryl Weaver is her coach; father is NBA Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing. Important because she represents both privilege (family connections) and pioneer status.

## Key Institutions

### High Schools

**DeMatha Catholic** (Hyattsville): Football and basketball powerhouse. 41 men's basketball conference championships, 20+ NBA alumni. Recently had Kendall Fuller and Dorian O'Daniel (now with Kansas City Chiefs) as teammates. Important for understanding elite Catholic school sports.

**Good Counsel** (Olney): Another Catholic powerhouse. Fuller and O'Daniel both went here—important pipeline to NFL.

**Bishop McNamara** (Forestville, Prince George's County): Strong softball program. Near Washington Catholic Athletic Conference teams. Important for understanding Prince George's County athletics.

**Gilman School** (Baltimore): All-boys private school. Dylan Walters (tennis) and other athletes. Important for understanding Baltimore private school sports.

### Colleges/Universities

**University of Maryland, College Park**: Major Division I program in Big Ten Conference. Featured extensively in football attendance analysis (56.3% gap between announced and scanned attendance in 2018—**second-highest in Big Ten**). Women's basketball and gymnastics also prominent.

**Important caveat**: The attendance story reveals Maryland had the **lowest percentage** of sold tickets actually scanned among seven Big Ten schools providing complete data in 2018. This is a significant ongoing story about fan engagement and economic impact.

### Professional Teams

**Baltimore Orioles**: MLB team playing at Camden Yards. Featured in stories about:
- Attendance returning post-COVID
- International scouting changes under GM Mike Elias (hired November 2018)
- 2023 home run surge discussions
- Economic impact of games

**Washington Nationals**: Won 2019 World Series (their first). Stories cover attendance policies post-COVID, Trea Turner injury, and Bryce Harper's departure to Philadelphia Phillies.

**Washington Commanders** (formerly Washington Football Team/Redskins): Acquired QB Carson Wentz in March 2022 trade. Ongoing name change and ownership controversies.

**D.C. Defenders**: XFL team that launched February 2020. Played at Audi Field. Important for alternative football leagues story.

### Sports Betting/NIL Organizations

**PointsBet**: Denver-based sports betting company. Signed **September 2020** deal with University of Colorado Boulder worth $1.625 million over five years. Important for understanding college sports betting partnerships.

**The deal's unique provisions** (story published February 2023):
- Allowed PointsBet signs at new student orientation and events with underage students
- Included $30 fee to university when anyone signed up using CU promotional code (discontinued January 2023 by "mutual decision")
- Represents early model of university-gambling company relationship

**Overtime Elite**: Development program for elite high school basketball players. Pays minimum $100,000/year. Launched October 2021 with 27 players split into three teams. Located in Atlanta. Important for understanding alternatives to traditional high school → college path.

**Opendorse**: Company that partnered with University of Maryland to create "Momentum" program for student-athlete brand building. Story from March 2021.

## Current/Ongoing Issues

### 1. High School Sports Gambling Exposure

**The University of Colorado-PointsBet model** (February 2023 investigation):
- **Key concern**: Sports betting company marketing at events attended by students under legal gambling age (21 in Colorado)
- CU Boulder student population: 34% are 18-19 years old
- No gambling allowed in university housing despite campus marketing

**Maryland parallel**: Maryland launched retail sports betting December 2021, but mobile betting delayed due to Sports Wagering Application Review Commission (SWARC) process.

**Story ideas**:
1. **Has Maryland implemented similar university-gambling partnerships?** The Colorado model came under scrutiny. Are Maryland universities (UMD, Towson, UMBC, etc.) pursuing or avoiding such deals?

2. **High school sports betting education**: Do Maryland high schools discuss gambling risks with athletes? Are coaches trained to spot problem gambling?

3. **Maryland's "racial equity" approach to betting licenses**: SWARC is tasked with "achieving racial, ethnic and gender diversity when awarding licenses." **How's that going?** The story is dated April 2022 and said mobile betting was delayed. Mobile betting is now active in Maryland—**follow-up needed** on whether diversity goals were met.

### 2. Youth Football and Health Concerns

The "Youth Tackle Football" investigation (February 2024) revealed:

**Key polling data** (Povich Center-CDCE-Post poll, November 2023):
- 66% of parents comfortable with outdoor sporting events like baseball
- Only 32% comfortable with indoor events like basketball
- **79% of Black parents**, 81% of white parents, and 77% of Hispanic parents believe playing football is dangerous for young people

**Yet**: 
- 61% of white parents, 66% of Black parents would let child play tackle football
- 24% of Black parents, 12% of white parents say ages 5-7 appropriate to start tackle

**Geographic focus**: Stories profiled:
- **Lexington, Mississippi** (population 1,154): Produced 3 players on 2023 Power Five rosters—best per capita rate for towns with 250+ people in state
- **Buford, Georgia**: 23 Power Five players in 2023 from town of 16,800—more than 12 states

**Maryland angle undercovered**: 
- How do Maryland's youth tackle programs compare to national trends?
- What's happening in Prince George's and Montgomery counties' youth football programs?
- Are Maryland programs seeing participation declines?
- What safety protocols are Maryland programs implementing?

**Story ideas**:
1. **Maryland Youth Football Participation Trends**: Get data from Maryland Youth Football League and compare to national trends. Interview parents about their decision-making process.

2. **Prince George's County pipeline**: Counties like Prince George's are football talent hotbeds. How do youth programs there balance safety concerns with the sport's cultural importance and economic opportunities for families?

3. **Where are the Maryland stories in national youth football coverage?** The investigation focused on Mississippi, Georgia, and Atlanta. Maryland has similar demographics in some areas. What's different here?

### 3. College Sports Attendance and Economics

**Maryland football attendance crisis** (story from November 2019):

Key findings:
- Maryland had **56.3% gap** between announced (tickets distributed) and scanned (actual) attendance in 2018—**second-highest among 9 Big Ten schools providing data**
- Only **43.7% of sold tickets** were scanned in 2018—**last among 7 schools providing complete data**
- Maryland filled **only 23.8% of total stadium capacity** based on scanned tickets (last among 9 schools)

**NCAA rule context**: NCAA allows announced attendance to be either:
1. Actual attendance (tickets scanned), OR
2. Tickets distributed (tickets sold + complimentary tickets)

**Matt Monroe** (Maryland Associate AD for Ticket Operations): Called using distributed tickets "common practice" because "if a ticket is paid for, it's distributed. You count that into your revenue."

**The bigger picture**: All 9 Big Ten schools providing data saw scanned attendance drops from 2017 to 2018. Seven saw drops from 2016 to 2017.

**Story ideas/follow-ups** (**URGENT—attendance patterns likely changed post-COVID**):

1. **What's Maryland's 2023-24 attendance picture?** The most recent data in stories is from 2018-19. Request updated data through records requests. Has the gap between announced and scanned attendance grown or shrunk?

2. **Post-COVID attendance**: How did COVID-19's impact on attendance linger? Are fans returning? The 2023 story about fans returning to Capitals games suggests some recovery, but football might be different.

3. **Economic impact**: If Maryland isn't filling seats, what's the lost revenue? How does this affect athletic department budgets? Are concessions, parking, merchandise sales down?

4. **Student attendance**: What percentage of those scanned tickets are students? Are students staying away? Why?

5. **Basketball attendance gap**: The women's basketball attendance story (April 2023) noted UMD women drew 7,379 average (highest since 2009) but men drew 14,046. The women filled 41% of XFINITY Center capacity—highest in 10 years. But both programs struggle to fill the 17,950-seat arena. **What's the plan?** Some schools are moving to smaller venues (Baylor cut capacity from 10,000 to 7,500; Texas from 17,900 to 11,000). Is Maryland considering this?

### 4. Climate Change and Sports

**Important but potentially outdated story** (December 2019):

Key points:
- Baseball vulnerable due to rain delays (54 postponements in 2018, highest in nearly 3 decades)
- Texas Rangers built new stadium with retractable roof, cost $300+ million
- Qatar World Cup moved from June/July to November 2022 due to heat concerns
- Skiing resorts particularly vulnerable—31% in danger of closing per 2015 report

**Story ideas**:
1. **Maryland facilities and climate**: Are Maryland Stadium, XFINITY Center, or SECU Stadium (for lacrosse) considering climate control upgrades? What about local minor league or amateur facilities?

2. **Orioles and Nationals**: Both have retractable roofs (Camden Yards does not, Nationals Park does not). Are summer day games becoming less viable? Attendance data by temperature/weather?

3. **Winter sports in Maryland**: Are ski resorts like Wisp Resort in Western Maryland seeing shorter seasons? Economic impact on Garrett County?

4. **Youth sports and heat**: Are youth leagues in Maryland changing practice schedules due to heat? Any heat-related incidents in recent years?

### 5. Baltimore Sports Economic Development

**Orioles attendance and economics** (April 2021 story):

The pandemic profoundly impacted attendance. The April 2021 story noted:
- 25% capacity at Camden Yards for 2021 opener
- 12% capacity at Nationals Park
- Extensive COVID protocols (masks required except when eating/drinking, no cash, digital tickets only, socially distanced pods)

**Pimlico Race Course redevelopment** (April 2024 story):
- Maryland lawmakers approved 3-year renovation
- Stronach Group transferring ownership to state
- Plans for new track, hotel, parking garage, surrounding development
- Home of the Preakness Stakes

**Story ideas/follow-ups**:

1. **Post-COVID attendance recovery**: How are Orioles attendance figures now compared to pre-pandemic? The team has been competitive recently—is that translating to butts in seats?

2. **Pimlico progress**: The April 2024 story said renovation would take 3 years. **That means completion around 2027**. What's the current status? Has construction started? Any delays? What's the economic impact on the surrounding neighborhood?

3. **Maryland Million**: A 2020 story profiled Nancy Heil and her horse Karan's Notion winning the Maryland Million Sprint. The race generates $4-6 million annually. **How has this event fared post-COVID?** Is it growing or shrinking?

4. **Motorsports recovery**: Hagerstown Speedway and Maryland International Raceway both took major financial hits in 2020. Hagerstown made about $200,000 in 2020, down from projected $800,000. MIR lost half its revenue. **How are these venues doing now?**

## Key Caveats and Uncertainties

### Ongoing/Unresolved Issues

1. **Trea Turner injury (2023)**: The April 2023 story described Turner's broken finger as potentially season-ending, but didn't have a specific timetable. **Caveat**: Turner is now with the Philadelphia Phillies. Not clear what long-term impact was.

2. **Pimlico renovation timeline**: Announced April 2024 as "3-year renovation" but no specific start date provided. **Caveat**: It's unclear if construction has begun or if there have been delays. Reporters should verify current status.

3. **Maryland Stadium Authority funding**: The Pimlico story mentions $70 million approved in 2021 for Hagerstown baseball stadium. **Caveat**: The February 2023 Hagerstown stories describe the project as still in planning phases. It's unclear if both projects are being funded simultaneously or if there are budget conflicts.

4. **CU Boulder-PointsBet promotional code fees**: The February 2023 story notes the $30-per-signup fee was discontinued in January 2023 by "mutual decision" but doesn't explain why. **Caveat**: This suggests possible controversy or policy concerns that weren't fully explained. Follow-up needed.

5. **SWARC's disparity study**: The April 2022 Maryland sports betting story mentions SWARC wanting to "run another disparity study" before awarding licenses. **Caveat**: It's unclear if this study was completed, what it found, or if it delayed mobile betting further.

6. **COVID-19 protocol enforcement**: The April 2021 Orioles story describes extensive mask and safety protocols. **Caveat**: It's unclear how long these lasted or how strictly they were enforced. Some protocols mentioned (like ejection for mask violations) may have been relaxed quickly.

7. **Overtime Elite's success**: Multiple 2019-2020 stories describe Overtime Elite as a new venture. **Caveat**: As of the most recent stories (2022), OTE hasn't produced any NBA draft picks yet. The model's success is unproven. Reporters should verify current status.

8. **Maryland youth football participation**: The February 2024 investigation notes national declining participation but doesn't provide specific Maryland data. **Caveat**: Maryland trends may differ from national trends. Local data is needed.

## Important Context and Background

### Historical Context

**The Shirley Povich Center**: Named after legendary Washington Post sportswriter Shirley Povich (1905-1998), who covered D.C. sports for 75 years. The center conducts regular polling on sports issues and emphasizes issues of race, gender, and politics in sports—themes that ran through Povich's career.

**Povich was known for**:
- Writing about integration of baseball (critical of segregation)
- Covering Washington Senators, Redskins for decades
- Elegant, literary sports writing style

**This explains** why the center's polling focuses on issues like:
- Racial attitudes toward NIL and youth sports opportunities
- Transgender athletes in sports
- National anthem at sporting events (with focus on racial disparities in sentiment)

### The NIL Backstory

**NCAA v. Alston** (Supreme Court decision, June 2021): Opened door for college athletes to profit from NIL. But the immediate question became: What about high school athletes?

**The cascade**:
1. Some states moved quickly to allow high school NIL (California leading)
2. Maryland waited until December 2022
3. By 2023, 30 states allowed high school NIL
4. By February 2024, 41 states + D.C. allowed it

**Why it matters for Maryland**: The state was **not** an early mover on this issue. That may mean:
- Athletes transferred out of state
- Maryland programs lost recruiting edge
- Policy was more considered/careful

**Or it may mean**:
- Maryland was cautious appropriately
- Avoided pitfalls of early adopters
- Better policy as a result

**This is a reporting question**.

### The "Power Five" Context

When stories reference "Power Five" or "Power 5," they mean:
- Big Ten (includes Maryland, Penn State, Ohio State, Michigan, etc.)
- SEC (Southeastern Conference)
- ACC (Atlantic Coast Conference)
- Big 12
- Pac-12 (though this conference is in flux/dissolution as of 2024)

**Maryland joined Big Ten in 2014**, leaving the ACC. This was a major financial decision—Big Ten has massive TV revenue. But it meant:
- Longer travel for most sports
- Different recruiting territory
- Less natural rivalry games (losing games with Duke, UNC, Virginia)

**This explains** why Maryland football attendance might be suffering. Big Ten games often lack local appeal compared to ACC games.

## Key Data Points to Remember

### Youth Football (Povich Center poll, November 2023)
- **23% of Black parents** say appropriate age for tackle is 9 or younger
- Only **14% of white parents** say the same
- But **24% of Black parents** say children shouldn't play tackle at all under 18
- **21% of white parents** say the same

**The tension**: Black families see more opportunity in football but also recognize dangers.

### Maryland Football Attendance (2018 data—needs updating)
- **56.3% gap** between announced and scanned attendance (2nd worst in Big Ten)
- **23.8% of stadium capacity** filled based on scanned tickets (worst in Big Ten)
- **43.7% of sold tickets** actually scanned (worst among 7 Big Ten schools with complete data)

### Maryland Demographics (relevant for sports stories)
- **Prince George's County**: 64.5% Black (2020 Census), median income $90,344
- **Montgomery County**: 21.4% Black, 19.4% Hispanic, median income $111,812
- **Baltimore City**: 62.4% Black, median income $54,124

**Why this matters**: 
- Sports participation patterns differ by county
- Economic factors affect pay-to-play sports
- Demographics help explain why Black and Hispanic parents' attitudes toward NIL (more supportive) matter for Maryland policy

### Sports Betting Economics (Maryland)
- Retail betting launched: **December 2021**
- Tax collected in 2021 (partial year): **$469,297**
- Mobile betting: **Delayed into 2022** (exact launch date unclear from stories)
- Neighboring states allowing mobile: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Virginia
- Pennsylvania generated **$11.3 million** in sports betting tax (Jan-Feb 2022)
- Virginia generated **$4.3 million** (Jan-Feb 2022)

**The gap suggests Maryland left money on the table** by delaying mobile betting.
