# Immigration Coverage Guide for Early-Career Journalists

## Understanding the Landscape

Immigration coverage in this region centers on Maryland and the broader Washington D.C. area, home to substantial immigrant communities from El Salvador, Latin America, China, Korea, Jamaica, Afghanistan, and other countries. The stories span policy changes, individual human struggles, and community impacts, with particular focus on how federal immigration enforcement affects local residents.

The Trump administration's immigration policies dominate recent coverage, including mass deportation efforts, workplace raids, birthright citizenship challenges, and changes to visa programs. Maryland has emerged as a state actively resisting these policies through legislation and legal challenges, while immigrant communities face heightened fear and uncertainty.

## Key People and Institutions

**Senator Chris Van Hollen** appears frequently in coverage, particularly around the case of Kilmar Abrego García, a Maryland resident wrongfully deported to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador and has introduced legislation demanding accountability from the Trump administration. Senator Ben Cardin also advocates for immigrant rights, including protections for Temporary Protected Status holders and legislation supporting asylum seekers.

**CASA de Maryland** serves as the primary immigrant advocacy organization in the state, filing lawsuits against the Trump administration (including one challenging the birthright citizenship executive order) and providing community resources. The organization appears in stories about workplace raids, legislative advocacy, and community organizing.

**Maryland Governor Wes Moore** signed legislation granting undocumented immigrants access to purchase health insurance through the state exchange. The Maryland General Assembly has been active on immigration issues, passing the Access to Care Act and considering bills like the Trust Act and the Dignity Not Detention Act.

## Geographic Focus Areas

**Langley Park** in Prince George's County represents a crucial immigrant hub, particularly for Central Americans. Stories from this area address day labor wage theft, economic impacts of deportation threats, and community organizing efforts. **Hyattsville** also features prominently as home to immigrant communities, including Liberians seeking program extensions.

**Ocean City** provides a different angle, dependent on seasonal workers through J-1 and H-2B visa programs. The seafood industry more broadly relies heavily on temporary foreign workers, creating vulnerability when visa programs face restrictions.

## Major Ongoing Stories Requiring Follow-Up

### The Kilmar Abrego García Case

This represents one of the most compelling ongoing stories. Abrego García was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in April 2025 and imprisoned in CECOT prison despite the Supreme Court ordering his return. **It remains unclear whether he has been returned to the United States.** Stories should investigate:

- Has the Trump administration complied with the Supreme Court order?
- What is his current status and location?
- What mechanisms exist to prevent similar wrongful deportations?
- How has his family in Maryland been affected during this extended separation?
- What consequences, if any, has the administration faced for defying the court order?

The related legislation introduced by Van Hollen and fellow Democrats requiring reports on wrongful deportations and El Salvador's human rights record also needs follow-up on whether it passed and what impact it has had.

### Department of Homeland Security Business Visits

In May 2025, DHS agents visited over 100 businesses in the Washington D.C. area, including popular restaurants like Pupatella, to verify compliance with employment laws. **The full scope and impact of these visits remains unclear.** Follow-up questions include:

- How many workers were detained or deported as a result?
- Have additional raids or visits occurred since May?
- What legal challenges have emerged from these operations?
- How has this affected business operations and worker behavior?
- Are workers avoiding their jobs out of fear, and what economic ripple effects have resulted?

### Chinese Student Visa Revocations

The May 2025 story about hundreds of Chinese exchange students having visas revoked due to U.S.-China tensions needs substantial follow-up. Questions include:

- How many students at Maryland universities have been affected?
- What happens to students mid-semester when their visas are revoked?
- Are there legal challenges to these revocations?
- How are universities responding to support affected students?
- What criteria determine which students face revocation?

### Loss of Federal Funding for Migrant Children's Legal Aid

The Trump administration ended funding for legal representation of unaccompanied immigrant children in March 2025, potentially affecting thousands of teens in Maryland. **It's unclear how this has played out in practice.** Important questions:

- How many Maryland children lost legal representation?
- What organizations like the Amica Center have done to fill the gap?
- Have deportation rates for unaccompanied minors increased?
- Are there cases of children appearing in immigration court without counsel?
- What local or state funding efforts have emerged to address this?

## Undercovered Story Ideas

### Economic Impact Deep Dives

While a December 2024 story warned that mass deportations could harm Maryland's economy, there hasn't been concrete reporting on whether this has materialized. A story could examine:

- What sectors have experienced labor shortages due to deportation fears?
- How have businesses adjusted operations?
- What is the actual economic data showing about tax revenue, consumer spending, and business closures in immigrant-heavy areas?
- Interview business owners in Langley Park, agricultural operations, seafood processors, and construction companies about tangible impacts.

### The Maryland Data Privacy Act Implementation

Legislation proposed in February 2025 would protect Maryland residents' data from federal immigration enforcement without a warrant. **It's unclear if this passed or how it's being implemented.** A story should investigate:

- Did the Maryland Data Privacy Act become law?
- If so, has ICE requested data and been denied?
- What legal conflicts have emerged between state and federal authorities?
- How are other sensitive locations (schools, hospitals) interpreting these protections?

### Healthcare Access for Undocumented Immigrants

The Access to Care Act passed in April 2024, allowing undocumented immigrants to purchase health insurance through Maryland's exchange. Follow-up reporting should examine:

- How many people have enrolled since implementation?
- What barriers remain (cost, fear, awareness)?
- How has this affected healthcare utilization and emergency room visits?
- What are the actual fiscal impacts on the state?
- Are other states watching Maryland as a model?

### Afghan Refugees: One Year Later

Multiple stories from 2021 covered Afghan refugee resettlement, but there's been limited follow-up on how evacuees on temporary humanitarian parole (which only lasts two years) have fared. Questions include:

- What happened when initial parole periods expired?
- How many Afghan evacuees in Maryland have secured permanent status?
- What employment and integration challenges persist?
- Are there Afghan evacuees now facing deportation back to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan?

### Birthright Citizenship Litigation Update

Maryland joined the lawsuit against Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship in January 2025. The story featuring "Meny," a pregnant immigrant, needs follow-up:

- What is the current status of CASA v. Trump?
- Has Meny's child been born, and what citizenship documentation did they receive?
- How many Maryland families are affected?
- What have lower courts ruled?
- Are hospitals and state agencies issuing birth certificates normally?

### H-2B Visa Workers During COVID: Accountability

A powerful investigative series from May 2021 documented how seafood processing employers brought Mexican H-2B workers to Maryland during the pandemic while bypassing quarantine and testing requirements. **It's unclear if any accountability measures resulted.** Follow-up should investigate:

- Did any employers face penalties?
- Have worker safety protections improved?
- What happened to the specific workers profiled?
- Has Maryland implemented any oversight of H-2B employer practices?

### Wage Theft Enforcement

Stories from 2017 documented widespread wage theft affecting immigrant day laborers in places like Langley Park. With increased deportation fears potentially making workers even more vulnerable, reporting should examine:

- Has wage theft increased as workers become less likely to report?
- What is Maryland's enforcement record on wage theft cases?
- Have any recent high-profile cases been prosecuted?
- What resources exist for workers to recover stolen wages, and are they being used?

### TPS and DED Holders

Multiple stories covered Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure programs, with Liberians rallying in March 2019 for extensions and senators introducing the SECURE Act in 2017 to provide pathways to permanent residency. **These storylines need comprehensive follow-up:**

- What happened to the SECURE Act?
- Did Liberians receive their extension, and what is their current status?
- How many TPS holders from El Salvador, Haiti, and other countries remain in Maryland?
- Are any facing imminent deportation as designations expire?

### Immigration Detention in Maryland

The Dignity Not Detention Act was proposed in February 2021 to prevent ICE from renewing contracts for detention centers in Maryland. Questions include:

- Did this legislation pass?
- Are there still ICE detention facilities operating in Maryland?
- What are conditions like in any remaining facilities?
- Where are Maryland immigrants being held if not in-state?

### Municipal Trust Act Implementation

Proposed in March 2021, the Trust Act would prevent Maryland law enforcement from inquiring about immigration status or cooperating with ICE in sensitive locations. Important follow-up:

- Did this become law?
- If so, how are different counties implementing it?
- Have there been conflicts between sanctuary jurisdictions and ICE operations?
- What data exists on crime reporting by immigrants before and after implementation?

## Story Approaches for Complex Issues

### Humanizing Statistical Trends

The February 2025 story "Fearing ICE raids, Delmarva immigrants mostly stay home" noted that usually bustling areas had emptied but was published early in the Trump administration. A follow-up could examine whether this fear has proven founded:

- Interview immigrants who stopped going to work or taking children to school
- Document economic impacts on small businesses dependent on immigrant customers
- Examine whether predicted labor shortages materialized in poultry processing and agriculture
- Assess community mental health impacts of sustained fear

### Following Individual Cases Through the System

The approach used with Abrego García—following one person's story through the legal system—works powerfully for immigration coverage. Other candidates:

- A DACA recipient whose status expired and is now navigating an uncertain legal situation
- An unaccompanied minor trying to navigate immigration court without a lawyer after federal funding ended
- A Chinese student whose visa was revoked mid-semester
- An H-2B worker who experienced wage theft or unsafe conditions
- A family separated by deportation trying to maintain relationships across borders

### Comparative State Policy Analysis

Maryland has positioned itself as an immigrant-protective state through various legislative efforts. Stories could compare:

- Maryland's approach versus Virginia's or other Mid-Atlantic states
- Which policies are most effective at protecting immigrant communities
- Economic outcomes in sanctuary jurisdictions versus enforcement-heavy areas
- How state protections interact with federal enforcement priorities

### Workplace and Industry Focus

The May 2025 DHS business visits story deserves sector-specific follow-ups:

- **Restaurant industry:** How has fear of raids affected hiring, operations, and business viability in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods?
- **Seafood processing:** Are there enough H-2B workers, and what conditions do they face?
- **Construction:** How has the labor market shifted?
- **Agriculture:** What is happening on Maryland farms and Eastern Shore operations?

### Legal Mechanism Explainers

Immigration law is complex, and stories explaining how specific mechanisms work would serve readers:

- How the 287(g) program operates in Maryland counties that participate
- What happens procedurally when someone is detained by ICE
- How asylum applications are processed and what evidence is required
- What legal options exist for immigrants facing deportation
- How state and federal laws conflict on immigration enforcement

## Sources to Develop

**Immigrant advocacy organizations:** Beyond CASA, organizations like the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, Catholic Charities immigration services, and Welcome.US provide services and can connect reporters with affected individuals.

**Immigration attorneys:** Lawyers handling deportation defense, asylum cases, and family petitions can explain legal developments and connect reporters with clients willing to share their stories.

**Local government officials:** County executives, sheriffs, and police chiefs have varying approaches to cooperation with ICE and can explain local policy decisions.

**Business owners:** Employers in affected industries (restaurants, seafood processing, hospitality, agriculture) can speak to economic impacts and workforce challenges.

**Healthcare providers:** Doctors, nurses, and community health centers can discuss how immigration enforcement affects public health and healthcare access.

**School administrators:** Educators can speak to how enforcement fears affect student attendance, family engagement, and child welfare.

**Faith leaders:** Churches and religious organizations often provide sanctuary and support services to immigrant communities.

## Framing Considerations

When covering immigration enforcement, distinguish between different categories of immigrants (undocumented, DACA recipients, TPS holders, visa overstays, asylum seekers, green card holders) as they face different legal situations and vulnerabilities. Avoid conflating all immigrants with undocumented status.

Be specific about legal claims and their status. Many stories reference lawsuits filed but don't follow up on outcomes. Readers need to know whether legal challenges succeeded, failed, or remain pending.

Consider the tension between reporting on vulnerable communities and potentially exposing them to enforcement. Use pseudonyms when sources face deportation risks, avoid identifying details about locations where undocumented immigrants gather, and be thoughtful about photography.

Balance perspectives while avoiding false equivalence. Immigration enforcement affects real people with families and livelihoods, and their experiences deserve prominent placement. Policy positions from government officials provide important context but shouldn't overshadow human impacts.

Connect individual stories to systemic issues. One person's deportation is newsworthy, but it's more meaningful when placed in context of how many others face similar situations and what broader policies drive these outcomes.
