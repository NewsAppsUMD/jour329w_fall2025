Using Markdown format, produce a detailed narrative guide for an early-career journalist unfamiliar with the area that would allow them to understand the topic and the relevant people, locations, current issues and institutions. 

It should focus on what needs to be covered rather than what has been covered. Suggest ideas and questions for stories that haven't been covered, are undercovered or need to be followed up on. Be careful about stories that are ongoing or not resolved; include a caveat to let the reporter know that it is unclear if the issue has been resolved. Give more weight to stories published in the last year.

The language should be business casual but easy enough for a high schooler to read. It should not be primarily a list of bullet points. Make sure you introduce and explain ideas, people and issues with substantive but concise language. Not too many adjectives. Cite relevant stories with the headline, link, and month and year of publication.
