Use specific examples from the attached JSON to produce a descriptive but focused narrative guide in Markdown format that an early-career journalist unfamiliar with the area could read to understand the topic, including the key people, locations, current issues and institutions. 

Keep in mind that this is not a historical guide. It is meant to give a new reporter a place to start when they arrive — meaning it should focus primarily on what needs to be covered rather than what has been covered. Suggest stories that haven't been covered, haven't gotten enough coverage or have been covered but may need to be followed up on. 

Be careful about stories that are ongoing or not resolved, such as longer-term events, active lawsuits, policy debates, etc.; identify unfinished reporting, but include a caveat to let the reporter know that it is unclear if the issue has been resolved. Give more weight to stories published in the last year. If a timeline is a fundamental part of the overall story, mention that, but don’t over-emphasize older elements. 

The language should be business casual but easy enough for a high schooler to read. It should not be primarily a list of bullet points, but you can use bullet points for lists of proposed sources or questions relevant to a suggested story angle. 

Make sure you introduce and explain ideas, people and issues with substantive but concise language. Not too many adjectives. Cite stories that may provide useful context, including the story's headline, the link, and the month and year of publication.
