# cns final beatbook redux — cat murphy, oct. 21

Don't skimp on the details.  Describe important changes the prompt/data and the differences they made in the result. How good is the final version of the beat book? What does it lack?

ok, well, first, i just want to point out that the prototypes i'm going to be focusing on (mostly) here are the immigiration ones.

my best prototype, i think, is actually my second one. i ran a few other prompts, but none produced *great* results.

so, the first prompt i ran was a lengthened version of the one we wrote in class. but i think it fell under the "brittle" category of prompts. despite saying it shouldn't be primarily bullets, it was, in fact, primarily bullets. it didn't explain anything, and there were maybe three complete sentences in the entire thing. my favorite line was: 

"**Current status as of 2025**: Unclear whether Biden administration has secured permanent protections"

... right. it actually mentions biden five times, even though i thought the whole "recent reporting" instruction was pretty clear.

anyway. i edited that prompt with literally one goal in mind: shorter. i was getting the vibe that it was, per usual, getting lost in the sauce with a longer prompt (although it wasn't *that* long). either way, i cut it in half. generally speaking, the content was the same. but i cut out things like this:

```
"Keep in mind that this is not a historical guide. It is meant to give a new reporter a place to start when they arrive — meaning it should focus primarily on what needs to be covered rather than what has been covered"
```

for this:

```
It should focus on what needs to be covered rather than what has been covered.
```

or, instead of this:

```
Be careful about stories that are ongoing or not resolved, such as longer-term events, active lawsuits, policy debates, etc.; identify unfinished reporting, but include a caveat to let the reporter know that it is unclear if the issue has been resolved. 
```

i did this:

```
Be careful about stories that are ongoing or not resolved; include a caveat to let the reporter know that it is unclear if the issue has been resolved.
```

why use many words when few do trick?

i took out any mention of the json — i gave it to it, it knows it has it. most of the rest i kept generally the same, if slightly less wordy.

the response was INFINITELY better.

(side note: my roommate walked into the kitchen while i was doing this and said, "can you buy an individual scantron" because she works at the bookstore and someone came in asking to buy a singular scantron sheet because "his professor told him to get one." so we think he just misunderstood what the professor meant. however, i took a 10-minute break from this assignment to calculate the per-sheet cost of scantrons on amazon. you can buy a 600 pack at roughly 6 cents a page. fyi. and, yeah, yeah, i know, nobody asked you, patrice.)

ok back to regularly scheduled programming. 

first of all, better organization. don't really know why — i gave it *less* instruction on the format, so idk man. but between the two, here are the different headers:

first one:
- overview
- key people and institutions
- geographic focus areas
- current and ongoing issues
- story angles to pursue
- key sources to cultivate
- data sources
- important context
- red flags and verificatio needs
- ethical considerations
- quick reference: maryland immigration by numbers

second one:

- understanding the immigration landscape
- key institutions and players
- current and ongoing issues
- immigration policy mechanisms you need to understand
- questions for difference types of sources
- key data sources
- ethical considerations
- looking forward: story ideas
- conclusion

i appreciate that the second one doesn't have an "overview" section. the "understanding the immigration landscape" section *is* the overview, going into key population statistics and geographic concentrations in **SENTENCE FORMAT** rather than what the first one does, which is shove all of those overview statistics into individual sections without explanations.

the people/institutions section was also better in the second one. here's a comparison of how the two broke down federal officials.

first one: 

```
- **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)**: Oversees immigration enforcement, including ICE operations
- **U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)**: Processes visa applications, DACA renewals, and naturalization cases
```

second one:

```
**U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)**: The primary enforcement agency. In Maryland, ICE operates through partnerships with local jurisdictions via 287(g) agreements (Cecil, Frederick, and Harford counties) and detention contracts (Howard, Frederick, and Worcester counties). These agreements allow local officers to perform immigration enforcement functions.

**U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)**: Processes immigration applications, including DACA renewals, work permits, and naturalization. Processing times in Maryland range from 10-15.5 months for naturalization applications.

**Department of Homeland Security (DHS)**: Oversees immigration policy and enforcement. Under the Trump administration, DHS significantly expanded enforcement priorities and detention operations.
```

the 287(g) agreement anecdote was my favorite aspect of this, because it's an important detail and a good place to look for stories, but it's not some random side quest.

the first one then goes into "maryland congressional delegation" and "state and local officials" ... mhhhhmkay, not sure why those are split up, but they include riveting details like:

```
- **Sen. Ben Cardin (D)**: Co-sponsors immigration protection legislation
- **Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Mechanicsville)**: House Majority Leader, supports pathway to citizenship
```

and 

```
- **Gov. Wes Moore (D)**: Welcomed Afghan evacuees, supports immigrant communities
```

like, no.

meanwhile, the second one says the governor's office "has generally taken a protective stance toward immigrants, though this varies by administration" — which i think is more helpful. however, it doesn't actually mention moore by name, or any of maryland's representatives, for that matter. and for at least van hollen, that's kind of an issue.

i really loved that the second one went into local law enforcemnt, saying "Jurisdictions differ dramatically in cooperation with ICE" before providing examples of places on either side of the issue — which i think is considerably more helpful than the "academic experts" section in the first one.

the second one's "current and ongoing issues" section really stood out.

the two prototypes generally had the same topics, but where the first one had this under "Legal Limbo Cases (URGENT - UNRESOLVED)":

```
**Kilmar Abrego García Case**: This is **ongoing litigation** with unclear resolution status. A Maryland resident was wrongfully deported to El Salvador's CECOT prison despite court orders:
- Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that government must facilitate his return
- As of April 2025, Trump administration and El Salvador's President Bukele both refused to bring him back
- Sen. Van Hollen visited him in El Salvador
- Federal judges threatened contempt proceedings
- **Follow-up needed**: Check current status of this case
```

the second had this under "Deportation Cases and Family Separation":

```
The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia received significant coverage in 2025. Garcia, a Maryland resident with legal protection from deportation granted in 2019, was arrested by ICE and deported to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. Despite orders from a federal judge, appeals court, and Supreme Court to facilitate his return, the Trump administration refused. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador in April 2025 to check on Garcia's welfare.

**Story opportunities**:
- What happened to Garcia? Did he ever return to the U.S.?
- How many other Maryland residents have been deported despite having legal protections?
- The ongoing litigation against the administration
- The impact on Garcia's family in Maryland
- Similar cases that didn't receive media attention

**Caveat**: As of the latest coverage in April 2025, this situation remained unresolved. Any reporting must indicate the uncertain status.
```

the first one then moves on to story ideas, which were a mixed bag. but the second one goes into an explanation of immigration policy things: DACA, 287(g) agreements, IGSAs, H-2B visas, SIVs, TPS. i think that's great background.

holy shit as i was writing this i got a notification from the newsroom i interned at that advocacy groups are demanding transparency after an ICE raid in my college town.

where the second one geos to questions, the first one goes to ... sources? wasn't that the point of the key people section? super repetitive. they both have a data sources section, but the first one is five bullets long, the second is 10.

i hate the first one's "red flags and verification needs" section, which goes on about checking "claims about immigrant crime" against "actual data" and verifying "Trump or Biden administration had higher numbers (data shows Biden actually deported more in some periods)". just kind of patronizing and gross.

the ethical section goes from "Many immigrants have experienced violence; approach interviews carefully" and "Include voices of those concerned about immigration alongside advocates" in the first to "Consider whether a story, even if accurate, could expose individuals or communities to enforcement action. This doesn't mean avoiding tough stories, but it does mean thinking through consequences." just better overall. as were the story ideas, which were pretty well developed — i.e. "Maryland's immigration courts have a significant backlog. What does this mean in human terms? Find people who have been waiting years for hearings. What happens to their lives during this limbo?"

so i really liked this prototype. it left out a couple things — maryland's congressional representation being the main one, and it didn't cite its sources — but i'm a fan. lots of good stuff.

but why not mess around with it?

i wanted to see what being exceptionally bossy would do. like, what if the prompt tone is incredibly direct and explicit? my hypothesis was that it would suck because the rigidity of the prompt would make it crash out, but i wanted to see.

and i was ... not wrong?

i say that because it wasn't great, but it wasn't as bad as i was expecting, i guess? it ignored one critical instruction: focus on recent reporting. it's interesting that this seems to be the thing that gets missed. because the content itself wasn't necessarily terrible, it was just massively outdated. i mean, it suggested that i follow up on stories about covid among seafood workers and do reporting on the 2020 census. it also ignored my instruction to keep it to 300 lines. again, probably the rigidity, but not as bad as i was expecting.

so i kind of just settled on my second prompt. but the next thing i tried was the story summaries without the content.

this one wasn't bad, but it also wasn't what we were looking for, you know? like, it was mostly bulleted story ideas to be honest. and the story ideas themselves were ok, but there was no real explanation of any one issue.

the last thing i tried was the same prompt but with sonnet 4. it was 100 lines shorter than even the no content version, and it was more bullet points than not.

ok bye
