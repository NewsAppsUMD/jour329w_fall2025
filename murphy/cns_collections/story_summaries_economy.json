Despite laying off 93 employees, Rosebud rehired 50 former Corsa workers and will continue producing metallurgical coal at the site.", "content": "Maryland\u2019s largest active underground coal mine changed hands last month after the mine\u2019s previous operator, Canadian firm Corsa Coal, filed for bankruptcy and auctioned assets to pay creditors.\nThe new operator, Pennsylvania-based Rosebud Mining Company, will not inherit the dozens of delinquent fines levied by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for safety violations at the Casselman mine in Garrett County, Maryland.\nA Western District of Pennsylvania Bankruptcy Court judge approved a $15 million bid from Rosebud to acquire two underground mines in March, though Corsa\u2019s creditors delayed finalizing the sale in hopes of attracting a higher bid.\nIn a declaration filed with the court in January, Corsa President Kevin Harrigan attributed his company\u2019s financial troubles in part to an unpredictable market. \u201cEconomic uncertainty, inflationary pressures and corresponding monetary policy controls\u201d pushed coal prices below Corsa\u2019s mining costs in 2024, Harrigan wrote, straining the company\u2019s ability to cover looming debt payments.\nCorsa did not respond to a Capital News Service request for comment by press time.\nThe company issued layoff notices to 93 employees at the Casselman mine on March 13 \u2013 a majority of the more than 100 people working at the mine as of 2024, according to MSHA records.\nRosebud hired 50 former Corsa employees after the acquisition, most of whom remain at the Casselman mine.\nThe mine produced roughly 660,000 tons of coal in 2023 \u2013 a relatively small output compared to the largest mines in neighboring Pennsylvania and West Virginia, but more than twice the output of the next-largest mine in Maryland in the same year.\nThe Casselman mine yields metallurgical coal, used to heat blast furnaces for steel production.\nWhile the market for thermal coal, used to generate electricity, has dwindled in the face of competition from cheap natural gas and renewable energy sources, the metallurgical coal market is relatively insulated from those pressures.\n\u201cThere is still a very strong need for metallurgical coal,\u201d said Allegany Coal & Land Co. President Steve Jenkins, whose western Maryland company leases property to small coal operators.\nAnd although coal is not a renewable resource, Jenkins noted that Maryland\u2019s coal seams are far from expended. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of how much is accessible in the regulatory environment,\u201d he said.\nBut like any commodity, the metallurgical coal market experiences price fluctuations, including an ongoing supply imbalance that pushed prices below Corsa\u2019s mining costs.\nHarrigan\u2019s declaration makes no mention of delinquent MSHA fines, and the total amount left unpaid to the agency \u2013 just under $25,000 \u2013 is relatively minor compared to other obligations, including $21.3 million in debts acquired by purchasing or leasing mining equipment, parts and fuel.\nThose unpaid fines stem from a range of safety violations, including several flagged by MSHA as \u201creasonably likely to result in a serious injury or illness.\u201d\nIn October 2024, for instance, MSHA inspectors issued a $5,000 fine to the Corsa subsidiary operating the Casselman mine for allowing coal dust to accumulate, creating a fire or explosion hazard \u2013 one of more than 80 fines issued to the operator for the same violation since 2019, records show.\nOn the same day, inspectors also fined the company $2,400 for failing to provide adequate firefighting infrastructure for Casselman miners. Both fines remain delinquent, although Corsa paid other fines issued later the same year.\nA bankruptcy attorney representing Corsa did not respond to a CNS inquiry about why those delinquent fines were not listed as liabilities in the company\u2019s initial bankruptcy filing.\nBut Wes Addington, executive director of the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center, said MSHA doesn\u2019t pursue unpaid fines as aggressively as other federal regulatory agencies. The center is a nonprofit law firm based in Whitesburg, Kentucky, that represents coal miners and their families on black lung and safety cases and advocates on environmental issues related to coal extraction in the region.\n\u201cI\u2019m skeptical (about) how much energy the government is going to put into trying to collect those fines,\u201d he said, given MSHA\u2019s track record of allowing mines to continue operating with thousands of dollars in delinquent safety violation fines.\nThe change in ownership at the Casselman mine comes as some mine safety advocates like Addington raise alarms about the risks created by an increasingly feeble MSHA.\nAn analysis of public data published by the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center in March indicates that MSHA has lost roughly half of its coal mine inspection staff in the past decade.\nFederal law requires the agency to inspect surface mines at least twice and underground mines at least four times annually.\nTony Oppegard, a former mine inspector who previously served as an adviser to the MSHA administrator under President Bill Clinton, told Capital News Service that he doubts the agency will be held to those standards in the current political climate.\n\u201cIn years past, if MSHA was having a hard time making their twos and fours, there would generally be an oversight committee in the House and or the Senate who would call them in and want an explanation,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the current Congress, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019d even care.\u201d\nThe Trump administration\u2019s decision in March to close dozens of MSHA field offices, including several in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, compounded those concerns.\u00a0\n\u201cConsolidating offices will reduce emergency response efficiency by placing inspectors farther from mining sites, making it more difficult for them to respond quickly in the event of a mine disaster,\u201d said Erin Bates, the communications director for the United Mine Workers of America. \u201cWith an already limited workforce, stretching inspectors even thinner will reduce oversight effectiveness and compromise miner safety.\u201d\nWorkers at the Casselman mine are not unionized, and Maryland mines are served by an MSHA office in Morgantown, West Virginia that is not slated for closure."}]
