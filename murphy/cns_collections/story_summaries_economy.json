Despite laying off 93 employees, Rosebud rehired 50 former Corsa workers and will continue producing metallurgical coal at the site.", "content": "Maryland\u2019s largest active underground coal mine changed hands last month after the mine\u2019s previous operator, Canadian firm Corsa Coal, filed for bankruptcy and auctioned assets to pay creditors.\nThe new operator, Pennsylvania-based Rosebud Mining Company, will not inherit the dozens of delinquent fines levied by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for safety violations at the Casselman mine in Garrett County, Maryland.\nA Western District of Pennsylvania Bankruptcy Court judge approved a $15 million bid from Rosebud to acquire two underground mines in March, though Corsa\u2019s creditors delayed finalizing the sale in hopes of attracting a higher bid.\nIn a declaration filed with the court in January, Corsa President Kevin Harrigan attributed his company\u2019s financial troubles in part to an unpredictable market. \u201cEconomic uncertainty, inflationary pressures and corresponding monetary policy controls\u201d pushed coal prices below Corsa\u2019s mining costs in 2024, Harrigan wrote, straining the company\u2019s ability to cover looming debt payments.\nCorsa did not respond to a Capital News Service request for comment by press time.\nThe company issued layoff notices to 93 employees at the Casselman mine on March 13 \u2013 a majority of the more than 100 people working at the mine as of 2024, according to MSHA records.\nRosebud hired 50 former Corsa employees after the acquisition, most of whom remain at the Casselman mine.\nThe mine produced roughly 660,000 tons of coal in 2023 \u2013 a relatively small output compared to the largest mines in neighboring Pennsylvania and West Virginia, but more than twice the output of the next-largest mine in Maryland in the same year.\nThe Casselman mine yields metallurgical coal, used to heat blast furnaces for steel production.\nWhile the market for thermal coal, used to generate electricity, has dwindled in the face of competition from cheap natural gas and renewable energy sources, the metallurgical coal market is relatively insulated from those pressures.\n\u201cThere is still a very strong need for metallurgical coal,\u201d said Allegany Coal & Land Co. President Steve Jenkins, whose western Maryland company leases property to small coal operators.\nAnd although coal is not a renewable resource, Jenkins noted that Maryland\u2019s coal seams are far from expended. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of how much is accessible in the regulatory environment,\u201d he said.\nBut like any commodity, the metallurgical coal market experiences price fluctuations, including an ongoing supply imbalance that pushed prices below Corsa\u2019s mining costs.\nHarrigan\u2019s declaration makes no mention of delinquent MSHA fines, and the total amount left unpaid to the agency \u2013 just under $25,000 \u2013 is relatively minor compared to other obligations, including $21.3 million in debts acquired by purchasing or leasing mining equipment, parts and fuel.\nThose unpaid fines stem from a range of safety violations, including several flagged by MSHA as \u201creasonably likely to result in a serious injury or illness.\u201d\nIn October 2024, for instance, MSHA inspectors issued a $5,000 fine to the Corsa subsidiary operating the Casselman mine for allowing coal dust to accumulate, creating a fire or explosion hazard \u2013 one of more than 80 fines issued to the operator for the same violation since 2019, records show.\nOn the same day, inspectors also fined the company $2,400 for failing to provide adequate firefighting infrastructure for Casselman miners. Both fines remain delinquent, although Corsa paid other fines issued later the same year.\nA bankruptcy attorney representing Corsa did not respond to a CNS inquiry about why those delinquent fines were not listed as liabilities in the company\u2019s initial bankruptcy filing.\nBut Wes Addington, executive director of the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center, said MSHA doesn\u2019t pursue unpaid fines as aggressively as other federal regulatory agencies. The center is a nonprofit law firm based in Whitesburg, Kentucky, that represents coal miners and their families on black lung and safety cases and advocates on environmental issues related to coal extraction in the region.\n\u201cI\u2019m skeptical (about) how much energy the government is going to put into trying to collect those fines,\u201d he said, given MSHA\u2019s track record of allowing mines to continue operating with thousands of dollars in delinquent safety violation fines.\nThe change in ownership at the Casselman mine comes as some mine safety advocates like Addington raise alarms about the risks created by an increasingly feeble MSHA.\nAn analysis of public data published by the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center in March indicates that MSHA has lost roughly half of its coal mine inspection staff in the past decade.\nFederal law requires the agency to inspect surface mines at least twice and underground mines at least four times annually.\nTony Oppegard, a former mine inspector who previously served as an adviser to the MSHA administrator under President Bill Clinton, told Capital News Service that he doubts the agency will be held to those standards in the current political climate.\n\u201cIn years past, if MSHA was having a hard time making their twos and fours, there would generally be an oversight committee in the House and or the Senate who would call them in and want an explanation,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the current Congress, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019d even care.\u201d\nThe Trump administration\u2019s decision in March to close dozens of MSHA field offices, including several in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, compounded those concerns.\u00a0\n\u201cConsolidating offices will reduce emergency response efficiency by placing inspectors farther from mining sites, making it more difficult for them to respond quickly in the event of a mine disaster,\u201d said Erin Bates, the communications director for the United Mine Workers of America. \u201cWith an already limited workforce, stretching inspectors even thinner will reduce oversight effectiveness and compromise miner safety.\u201d\nWorkers at the Casselman mine are not unionized, and Maryland mines are served by an MSHA office in Morgantown, West Virginia that is not slated for closure."},

Under the new deal, the United States will reduce tariffs on goods imported from China from 145 percent to 30 percent, while China will lower its tariffs on American imports from 125 percent to 10 percent.\n\u201cIt is important to note that even with this China agreement, tariffs are much higher overall than they were at the beginning of the year,\u201d John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement issued after the U.S.-China trade talks. Businesses, including small enterprises, are trying to manage with the disruptions and growing costs, Murphy added.\n\u201cWe continue to urge the Trump Administration to prioritize tariff relief for businesses and families, and to address foreign trade barriers as it negotiates with other countries,\u201d Murphy said.\n\u201cUltimately, the impact of tariffs on the Port of Baltimore and all ports will depend on the length of time that the tariffs are implemented in addition to the decisions of shippers to send their products to the U.S.,\u201d Scher said.\nLast year, the Port of Baltimore was the second-biggest importer of automobiles in the United States. It lost its first place due to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, which paused operations at the port from March to July last year.\nBaltimore\u2019s port is one of the only ports in the country to have equipment and facilities to handle and store Roll-On/Roll-Off cargo like fully assembled cars, motorcycles and trucks.\nThe Port of Baltimore also receives other imports like nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery, aluminum, iron and steel, according to U.S. Census data.\nSome auto manufacturing customers that ship into U.S. ports, including Baltimore, are holding their vehicles at the port of entry, while others are adding import fees or absorbing the tariffs, Scher said.\nRep. Johnny Olszewski, D-Maryland, told CNS the tariffs are another setback for the Port of Baltimore, which still is recovering from the bridge collapse.\n\u201cIt\u2019s challenge after challenge after challenge, except this one is completely avoidable. There\u2019s no reason for the president to need to propose these tariffs,\u201d Olszewki said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no good reason expressed to members of Congress or the American people about what the real purpose of a tariff is.\u201d\nThe congressman said he has not received any complaints or concerns related to the tariffs from individual port workers.\nThe International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, which represents Baltimore\u2019s port workers, endorsed Trump in last year\u2019s election. ILA President Harold Daggett in January credited Trump with helping the union obtain a new contract with stronger provisions against automation. He called the president \u201cone of the best friends of working men and women in the United States.\u201d\nThe ILA said it had no comment on the tariffs for now.\nDai said the tariffs would impact port workers and truck drivers in the long run.\nThe Port of Baltimore is an economic engine that would have a direct and indirect impact on all the sectors and workers supporting it, Dai said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an entire ecosystem,\u201d he said."},

But aluminum \u2014 fabricated into beer cans and one of the largest costs for craft breweries \u2014 is under a 25% tariff.\n\u201c(Tariffs are) going to certainly be a negative for most Americans as far as costs increasing, not just in beer, but across everything,\u201d said Adam Benesch, cofounder of Union Craft Brewing. \u201cWhen you talk about a 25% increase in price, most businesses, whether it\u2019s beer or outside of beer, are not equipped to be able to absorb that increase in cost.\u201d\nAbout half of all aluminum used in America is imported, with the vast majority coming from Canada, according to Reuters. This includes cans manufactured by American companies and supplied to Union Craft and many other breweries.\nFinding a new can supplier is not a simple process, either. Accounting for the change in artwork and can printing plates, Benesch said it would take about a year to make the switch.\n\u201c(Aluminum tariffs are) going to significantly increase one of our largest costs of goods sold,\u201d Benesch said. \u201cUs and virtually any brewery and any company that uses aluminum in America, that comes from Canada.\u201d\nBALTIMORE \u2013 Beer cans are stacked to the ceiling at Union Craft Brewing in Baltimore. Brewers are worried that the tariffs on aluminum will boost costs of canned beer. (Colin McNamara/Capital News Service)\nWhile the aluminum tariffs may be the biggest cost hit, some Maryland breweries also import raw materials \u2014 including hops and malt \u2014 as well as other products from abroad.\nSome brewers have already begun to find domestic alternatives to their imported items. Hugh Sisson, the CEO and founder of Heavy Seas Beer, Maryland\u2019s largest craft brewery, told Capital News Service that he recently canceled an order of tap markers from China after the price increased 135%.\nBenesch and Sisson said they have not yet felt the full effects of the tariffs, but said all costs will likely be passed on to consumers. In preparation, Benesch ordered enough cans to last the company until late summer, with the expectation that a six-pack of beer will cost about a dollar more once tariffs trickle through the supply chain.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing in real time how destructive Trump\u2019s tariff taxes are to our neighborhood taprooms,\u201d Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Georgia, and co-chair of the Small Brewers Caucus, told CNS. \u201cTrump\u2019s tariffs are a tax on all of us, small brewers included. Whether it\u2019s barley, cans, kegs, or other industry equipment, Trump is driving up the cost of doing business\u2014and it could cost us our favorite local crafters as well.\u201d\nBut Sisson said the biggest effect on business will come in the form of consumer habits.\n\u201c(Tariffs have) completely shaken the confidence of the American consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect the luxury goods market to be adversely affected, and whether or not craft beer is considered a luxury good or not, that remains to be seen, but I do expect there to be people tapping the brakes in terms of a lot of their overall expenditures.\u201d\nAdditionally, craft beer is heavily dependent on restaurants, which have experienced negative effects from a shrinking economy in the first quarter of this year. McDonald\u2019s and Chipotle each reported their worst quarter since the middle of the COVID pandemic, perhaps serving as a marker for consumers\u2019 approach to eating out.\nRestaurants and breweries also have not fully recovered from the pandemic. More breweries closed than opened in the United States last year for the first time since 2005. There were 335 brewery openings and 399 closures in 2024, bringing the total to 9,736, according to the Brewers Association, a trade association that tracks independent breweries in America.\nIn Maryland, three major breweries \u2014 Guinness Open Gate Brewery, Flying Dog Brewery and DuClaw Brewing \u2014 shut down operations in the last two years. Guinness Open Gate Brewery still operates a visitor center, a taproom and restaurant at its Relay, Maryland, location; the brewery also continues to make experimental beers in small batches for the taproom. Flying Dog ended its Frederick, Maryland, operations after it was purchased by another company and brewing was moved to New York. DuClaw\u2019s Arundel Mills brewery was shuttered after it was bought by another company and production was moved to New Jersey.\nSisson predicts the tariffs will result in even more closures for breweries, who are already battling a shrinking market, which he attributes to the legalization of cannabis and decline in alcohol consumption among younger consumers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see more consolidation and more closings,\u201d Sisson said. \u201cIt is an economic cycle, I expect things will stabilize, I just don\u2019t think we\u2019ve gotten to the low yet.\u201d"},

The records showed 3,363 approved applicants. Maryland residents made up 97% of the applicants. The zip codes for Dundalk (21222), Baltimore (21206), and Pasadena in Anne Arundel County (21122) had the three largest totals of claimants, respectively.\u00a0\nThe next largest set of claimants came with home zip codes in nearby states such as Pennsylvania (63), Delaware (15), and Virginia (14). \n\n\u201cWhen you think about all of the individuals and the people who are reliant on the port or the activities surrounding the port for business, you quickly get a sense of the type of economic impact that that has,\u201d Becky Eisen, communications director for the Baltimore Community Foundation, said. \u201cEven though the port is now reopened, there has been a reverberation of impact in these communities.\u201d\u00a0\nThere were also a few workers in states like Washington, Florida, Georgia, and Minnesota. A Department of Labor spokesperson said all applicants were required to prove verification, and this could be due to several factors, including truckers with a distant home base or a temporary address in Maryland with a mailing address elsewhere.\nMaryland Senator Johnny Ray Salling, R-Baltimore County, one of the PORT Act\u2019s two sponsors, said he was \u201ckind of surprised\u201d that Worker Support Program funds reached so many states. As long as Maryland benefits, Salling said, he\u2019s okay with it.\u00a0\nIncluded in the PORT Act \u2014 a bipartisan relief effort which provided some $34 million worth of grants and loans \u2014 Maryland set up the Worker Support Program, which was funding targeted at those who had lost income following the March 26, 2024, Key Bridge collapse and the ensuing port closure. Approved applicants could receive weekly $430 payments. The program stopped taking applications on June 28, 2024,\u00a0 and accepted applicants received payments for a maximum of 13 weeks.\nThe Maryland Port Administration estimates the port\u2019s activity generates about 51,000 jobs, about 20,000 of which are directly working there. The port administration also estimates another 220,310 jobs that are at least related to port activity. That\u2019s just within Maryland. \n\nExperts have tied unemployment claims to the bridge collapse. Austin Wenck, Baltimore County\u2019s manager of data analytics, said he counted 562 port-related\u00a0 unemployment insurance claims between March 26 and May 7, 2024. He said about 81% of them were related to transportation or material moving jobs.\u00a0\nAndrew Bauer, an economist and vice president for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said port-related job markets have largely stabilized. The port has consistently proven itself insulated from significant shortfalls because of its location and importance to international commerce, Bauer said. The port bounced back from the pandemic and the bridge collapse, and Bauer doesn\u2019t expect the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs to damage the port.\u00a0\n\u201cThe way that we do commerce is going to depend on a lot of things being shipped.\u201d Bauer said. \u201cI think all the ports are going to be an asset and their services are going to be in demand as a result.\u201d\u00a0\nThose who received Worker Support Program money could also receive standard unemployment insurance benefits. Those claims spiked to their highest level of 2024, the week of the collapse.\u00a0\nBaltimore City, Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County dominated the communities with the most unemployment insurance claims between April 2024 and February 2025.\u00a0\u00a0In March 2024, Dundalk zip code 21222 had the most claims of any Maryland zip code.\u00a0\nBaltimore County data shows no industry was hit harder than transportation and warehousing \u2014 which are directly connected to the port. However, unemployment levels within the industry have generally returned to pre-collapse numbers. \n\nThe federal and state governments were not the only places people could turn for help.\u00a0\nThe Baltimore Community Foundation was one of several philanthropic funding efforts in response to the collapse. The Baltimore Community Foundation raised at least $16 million for bridge-related relief.\u00a0\nThe Baltimore Banner reported in early April that part of the money originally intended to go to families of the victims in the collapse was not delivered. Amid criticism, the Baltimore Community Foundation gave $1.2 million to victims\u2019 families, the Banner reported.\n\u00a0\nCorrection:\u00a0Dundalk\u2019s zip code was corrected to 21222."},

Although Maryland\u2019s trade with China had been growing before these measures took effect, the USCBC warned that the new barriers could disrupt future growth and increase costs for both businesses and consumers.\nJoshua Shifrinson, an international trade expert and associate professor of international relations at the University of Maryland, noted that while states like Maryland can sometimes soften the effects of national-scale trade tensions, they are still largely subject to federal policies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible for individual states to adapt to national-level disruptions,\u201d Shifrinson said. \u201cFor instance, states like Maryland can try to offset national-level tariffs by offering foreign firms preferential deals such as tax breaks. However, being a part of the U.S., there is only so much states can do.\u201d\nThe USCBC said that the speed at which the U.S.-China trade is declining is \u201cparticularly worrisome.\u201d Stockpiles of goods imported before the tariffs took effect are running out. \u201cThe impact will start to become visible to consumers in late May if both governments can\u2019t agree to remove or significantly reduce their tariffs,\u201d the USCBC stated, citing a report from Apollo Global Management, a private equity and investment firm.\n\nMaryland\u2019s top merchandise exports to China in 2024 included coal and petroleum gases, aerospace products and pharmaceuticals. \u201cCoal and petroleum gas exports to China were a major boon for the state, increasing $143.4 million last year, roughly 60 percent year over year,\u201d according to the USCBC. Growth in these energy and aerospace exports offset declines in agricultural goods in the same year.\nShifrinson said the types of products Maryland trades with China may have helped shield the state\u2019s exporters from some trade tensions.\nThese industries present both opportunities and challenges for Maryland. Some sectors might continue performing well despite the tariffs, while others, including aerospace and pharmaceuticals, could be more vulnerable, according to Shifrinson. The USCBC said that coal and oilseeds, two of Maryland\u2019s largest exports, are subject to additional retaliatory tariffs, making them especially affected.\nMaryland \u201cpunches slightly above its economic weight\u201d in exports to China, ranking 12th among U.S. states according to the USCBC. \u201cChina is a significant export destination for the state, with 7 percent of its total exports being destined for China last year,\u201d the council stated.\n\nU.S. goods exports to China fell for a second consecutive year, dropping from $145 billion in 2023 to $141 billion in 2024.\nMaryland\u2019s goods exports to China increased from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion over the same period, according to the USCBC. China represented 7 percent of Maryland\u2019s foreign goods exports and 5 percent of its foreign services exports in 2024. Though Maryland trails larger export powerhouses like Texas and California, China\u2019s share of the state\u2019s trade portfolio has grown.\nMaryland exports to China also supported more than 11,000 jobs in the state in 2022 and 2023. Those jobs included both direct employees who created goods and services and employees in supply chains and related industries. The USCBC said those jobs \u201care at significant risk\u201d unless both countries take steps to lower tariffs.\nServices, which are not usually subject to tariffs, also showed gains in the recent USCBC report. Maryland\u2019s service exports to China increased 10 percent from 2022 to 2023. Education, Maryland\u2019s top service export to China at $334 million in 2023, depends heavily on international student enrollment.\nJohns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland have historically drawn large numbers of international students, including many from China. While education exports have recovered to near pre-pandemic levels, Chinese student enrollment in the United States overall fell 4 percent, the USCBC reported. Chinese enrollment at the University of Maryland as of fall 2024 has fallen 50% since its 2017 peak, according to data from the university.\nLooking ahead, Shifrinson said the greatest threat to Maryland exporters may be uncertainty itself. \u201cBusinesses tend not to like risk\u201d, Shifrinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the policies at hand, but the sense that events could change rapidly and unexpectedly that may harm state-level exports.\u201d\nAt the same time, Shifrinson said state-level workarounds could provide new opportunities, particularly if foreign companies seek to onshore production or invest in states like Maryland.\n\u201cFor all the attention paid to the trade war, it\u2019s important not to view this primarily through an economic lens,\u201d he added. \u201cThe fears driving the current policies are largely strategic and security in nature. We need to view the economics tool in light of strategic considerations.\u201d\nWhile the full impact of the 2025 tariffs is yet to be seen, the USCBC believes Maryland\u2019s higher-value, more diversified exported goods may help the state withstand evolving trade conditions better than some others."},

The American Egg Board warns that egg prices will remain high until there is a sustained period without new detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) on egg farms.", "content": "Egg prices hit a record high in January as avian influenza continues decimating flocks around the country and in Maryland, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the CDC.\nThe average cost of a dozen large Grade A eggs was $4.95 for customers last month, beating the last record set in 2023 by 13 cents. For retailers, wholesale egg prices also reached an all-time high in February at $7.86, according to economic data platform Trading Economics.\nAs a result, refrigerated shelves normally housing eggs are sometimes barren and large grocery stores such as Lidl and Trader Joe\u2019s limit customer purchases while supplies are low. Restaurants, including national chains like Waffle House, have added surcharges on items with eggs or pulled items off the menu.\n\nA majority of U.S. counties affected by bird flu are in the Midwest, but the virus has hit Maryland flocks with hundreds and thousands of birds along the Eastern shore. It has spread as far as Montgomery County after the Maryland Department of Agriculture on Jan. 30 confirmed a small backyard flock was positive with the virus.\nEmily Metz, president and CEO of the national marketing checkoff program the American Egg Board, said in a statement to Capital News Service that highly pathogenic avian influenza, also referred to as HPAI, and high egg demand around Easter will keep egg prices high for now.\n\u201cThe reality is the system for egg production is both complex and time sensitive. While we can\u2019t predict the future, what we know right now is that our system is strained\u2014and HPAI remains a clear and present risk to poultry flocks,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a sustained period with no additional HPAI detections on egg farms to stabilize supply.\u201d\nBird flu basics\nIn January 2022, H5N1 \u2014 colloquially bird flu \u2014 was detected in U.S. wild birds for the first time in six years. Since then, over 160 million birds have been affected across more than 1,000 counties.\nWhile experts say public health risk remains low, the virus \u2014 which pops up naturally among wild aquatic birds \u2014 has spread to more than 200 mammals including pigs, cows and cats. Humans can become infected, but so far those who have were not exposed from another human. Most confirmed cases of the virus in people stemmed from exposure to dairy herds.\nAcross the 954 confirmed human cases reported to the World Health Organization since 2003, the fatality rate is about 52%, according to the CDC.\nIn the U.S., most recent bird flu cases have ended with quick recovery and have not required hospitalization. As of early January, there have been nearly 70 confirmed human cases of H5N1 in the U.S., including one death reported on Jan. 6 after a Louisiana man had close contact with backyard birds, according to the CDC.\nThe intensity of the virus in humans can vary based on exposure, underlying health conditions and medical care access. There have been no confirmed human cases in Maryland and a majority of those who are infected are meat and poultry workers, CDC guidance said.\n\nMeghan Davis, an associate professor in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said while there isn\u2019t an immediate threat to humans, bird flu concerns would grow if the virus acquires more traits of human-to-human transmission or mutations that make it deadlier or resistant to antiviral countermeasures.\n\u201cWe say that this virus has pandemic potential,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHighly pathogenic avian influenza has been around for a long time. \u2026 What\u2019s different about H5N1 is that it\u2019s had remarkable staying power.\u201d\nWhile the first description of bird flu dates back to the late 1800s, the current outbreak has had widespread impacts in the U.S. since early 2022.\n\nDay-to-day risk\nEggs and chicken are still safe to eat, according to CDC guidance. There are biosecurity measures in place that ensure infected birds are quarantined and do not appear on shelves. Even if they did, cooking poultry products at a high temperature would kill the virus and bacteria, according to Jaekeun Park, an assistant professor at University of Maryland who has studied avian influenza.\nMuhiuddin Haider, a clinical professor in the University of Maryland School of Public Health, said people should not consume raw milk and maintain basic hygiene practices to minimize any risk of exposure. While there is limited research on whether bird flu can be transmitted through raw milk consumption, unpasteurized milk increases the risk of ingesting dangerous bacteria, according to the CDC.\n\u201cThe risk to the food chain isn\u2019t super high, but that\u2019s not true if you\u2019re drinking raw milk or feeding your pets raw meat,\u201d Haider said.\nPets, particularly cats, can be infected, according to Ian Gill Bemis, a University of Maryland doctoral student who has studied bird flu in the animal. Mammal species are affected differently by bird flu, and cats can develop severe symptoms if infected, Bemis said.\nCats don\u2019t need to eat raw food or milk and should be kept inside if possible, Bemis said.\n\u201cIf you can keep your cat inside, that\u2019s a great first step, because your cat won\u2019t go and predate and eat wild birds,\u201d Bemis said.\nIt isn\u2019t clear how long this outbreak will last in the U.S. or what specific factors are contributing to its persistence, Park said. For now, egg prices will continue to be high due to low supply and people should take precautions, especially if they are high risk or work with poultry.\n\u201cWe always have to be worried about this type of thing,\u201d Park said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly low chance but extremely high consequence.\u201d"},

The majority of funding is given to the state\u2019s General Fund, and the Community Repair and Reinvestment Fund (CRRF) receives the second largest amount of funding. Funds that support small businesses, state public health and each of Maryland\u2019s counties also receive funding.\n\nThe Maryland General Assembly allocates 5% of cannabis tax revenue to counties based on the percentage of revenue collected from that county. Counties then distribute 50% of funds to municipalities with cannabis dispensaries that contribute to sales, leaving local governments with just 45 cents for every $100 in cannabis sales.\u00a0\nMaryland\u2019s Cannabis Public Health Fund, which also receives 5% of quarterly revenues, addresses health concerns following the legalization of adult-use cannabis. According to the state\u2019s Department of Health, emergency department visits related to cannabis use have risen to an average of 817 per month, up 4.8% compared to last year\u2019s average. The Department of Health said that data shows a 44% increase in emergency room visits among young people aged 20-29 between 2022 to 2023.\u00a0\nDespite this increase in visits, some products may not have been bought from legal dispensaries, according to\u00a0 director of communications for Maryland\u2019s Department of Health, Chase Cook.\u00a0\n\u201cIntoxicating hemp products (e.g., delta 8 and delta 10) are not subject to regulatory authority by MCA \u2013 including product safety and potency testing and packaging and labeling requirements. Unregulated products can put Marylanders at increased risk for adverse events,\u201d Cook told CNS in an email response.\n\nThe CRRF, which receives 35% of cannabis tax revenue, provides funding for community-based initiatives, particularly low-income communities and those that have been negatively affected by cannabis prohibition. In the first two quarters of 2024, the CRRF received nearly $12 million.\nA survey that was published in December of 2023 by the Office of Social Equity (OSE) reported that Marylanders would prefer funds be allocated towards mental health and substance abuse services, education and after-school programs and housing and homelessness prevention services.\u00a0\n\nThe Cannabis Business Assistance Fund (CBAF), which receives 5% of tax revenue, provides funding to small businesses such as women and minority-owned cannabis businesses. This fund distributed 174 social equity licenses to small businesses through a lottery system in March to encourage participation in the adult-use cannabis industry, according to the OSE.\u00a0\nThe CBAF has awarded millions in grants to support small businesses. In its first round of grants, the program provided license conversion fee assistance to 14 medical license holders. A second round supported non-operational conditional license holders, distributing up to $5 million each to nine businesses, according to the director of communications, Karen Hood, at the Department of Commerce. A third round of grants will be announced soon.\nThe remaining 50% of the tax revenue goes to the state\u2019s General Fund. Individual income tax and retail sales tax are two of the largest contributors to this fund, which supports K-12 education, Maryland health services and state government functions, according to the Department of Budget and Management.\nThe OSE reports that positive community perception of legalized cannabis is highest in those within the age group of 18 to 34, with 59% of participants reporting that the industry has benefited their community.\u00a0\nAccording to a report by Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, cannabis legalization has allowed Maryland to spend more on societal needs and to redirect resources previously expended on law enforcement, court proceedings, and imprisonment associated with marijuana consumption.\nMaryland\u2019s quarterly tax report for Q3 is set to be released next week, according to the Office of the Comptroller."},

In response, developers at a Maryland studio are unionizing to protect their interests amid industry volatility.", "content": "Game developers in Maryland and around the globe grapple with widespread layoffs despite the video game industry reporting record revenue. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent acquisitions and consolidation, tens of thousands of game developers worldwide lost their jobs.\nDuring the pandemic, many took up gaming as a hobby while stuck inside due to pandemic regulations, and high sales continued even after restrictions were lifted.\n\nIn 2022, Forbes reported that the video game industry generated more revenue than the film and music industries combined. According to Statista Market Insights, gaming earned just under $250 billion in 2023, and is already reporting $280 billion in 2024 even before the busy holiday season.\nThe influx of capital brought about several high-profile acquisitions, especially at Microsoft, the owner of Xbox. In 2021, they acquired ZeniMax Media, which is based in Rockville, Maryland and includes Bethesda Game Studios, known for titles such as \u201cFallout\u201d and \u201cThe Elder Scrolls.\u201d Microsoft then purchased the publisher Activision Blizzard for nearly $70 billion in 2023, a deal so large federal regulators both in the U.S. and in the United Kingdom almost killed it.\nThe industry consolidated around platformers \u2014 the few companies like Microsoft and Sony that own the platforms that games are played on \u2014 instead of the many publishers that produce games.\n\u201cI would argue that because of all this activity, it became one of those fast-growing tech sectors that caught the attention of a lot of new investors that destigmatized largely the gaming category as a mainstream form of entertainment,\u201d said Joost van Dreunen, the CEO of the data intelligence firm ALDORA and an adjunct professor at NYU Stern who teaches about the video game business.\nAfter the pandemic\u2019s boom of expansion in the industry, the market leveled out. Since most video game companies are publicly traded, the shareholders and investors applied pressure to decrease spending.\nThe result was massive layoffs. In 2023, the year after pandemic regulations in the U.S. had ended, game developer Farhan Noor estimates that over 10,000 developers across the globe lost their jobs. Noor is a technical artist for Riot Games who began taking note of layoffs across game development in 2010 after his first layoff, Noor wrote in a post on the social media site X. He collects data from a wide variety of gaming and business news outlets, studio press releases, personal contacts and social media platforms such as LinkedIn.\nBethesda faced a shocking round of layoffs at the beginning of 2023, said Taylor Welling, a content producer at Bethesda. Microsoft did not release a headcount of those affected.\n\u201cThat really started shaking people\u2019s sense of stability,\u201d Welling said. \u201cThere\u2019s also just the sense of fear that it instills. The industry is laying off people left and right. It seems like on a quarterly basis, there\u2019s another huge round of layoffs that happens, and so you\u2019re always concerned that you\u2019re going to be in the next round \u2014 or people that are important to you, that you talk to every day.\u201d\nAs of November 15, Noor estimates that 14,000 video game developers have been laid off in 2024. At the beginning of the year, Microsoft cut 1,900 staff from its gaming departments. In May, Microsoft shuttered three studios under the Bethesda banner and merged another.\n\u201cThe layoffs are a result of these high evaluations coming down and companies looking for efficiencies, and they start letting people go to cut costs,\u201d van Dreunen said. \u201cIn the games industry, the biggest cost is usually personnel.\u201d\nInfographic displaying data on layoffs in the video game industry over the last four years. (Dylan Shulman / Capital News Service)\n\u201cI expect those companies in a year, year and a half from now, to have to pay a premium to rehire a lot of those people,\u201d van Dreunen said. \u201cBut in the meantime, they\u2019re all slimming down and committed to this corporate version of using Ozempic.\u201d\nWelling said that in addition to the personal devastation of layoffs, there are also \u201cdownstream effects\u201d for the industry.\n\u201cPeople who are trying to get into the industry are now finding it hard to get their foot in the door because they have to compete with people who have a bunch of experience. So that\u2019s difficult for them, but then it\u2019s also difficult for the people who don\u2019t get laid off, because\u2026 they\u2019re expecting us to do the same amount of work in the same amount of time with fewer people involved.\u201d\nBethesda then became a leader of another burgeoning trend in the video game industry: unionization.\nUnionization efforts at Bethesda began in November 2023 following management\u2019s decision to require three in-person work days, Welling said. By July 2024, Bethesda was recognized as \u201cthe first wall-to-wall union at a Microsoft video game studio,\u201d Communications Workers of America (CODE-CWA) announced in a press release.\nBethesda union members organized with help from CODE-CWA and ZeniMax Workers United, a union among quality assurance personnel in Bethesda\u2019s parent company. ZeniMax Workers United went on strike Wednesday due to an ongoing negotiations dispute, IGN reported.\n\u201cUnionization has been absent from the games industry for most of its history,\u201d van Dreunen said. \u201cThe industry has historically been a bad employer. Things like crunch time are endemic to the games industry, and that\u2019s now starting to change.\u201d\nWelling said she hopes unions will become more common, especially with legal efforts like Microsoft\u2019s neutrality agreement that tear down barriers for unionization by mandating that management not interfere with union efforts. While unions can\u2019t outright prevent layoffs, they can offer employees protections and benefits.\n\u201cA lot of companies say that working at their company is like a family, and it\u2019s easy to roll your eyes at that, but at Bethesda, it definitely has that foundation to their culture,\u201d Welling said. \u201cSo there is a really strong sense of camaraderie and loyalty, not just to the company, but to each other. Despite the difficulties that are facing the industry right now, it\u2019s still a really great place to work.\u201d"},

In Montgomery, business formations totaled 16,471 in 2022, a 48% increase from 10 years earlier. (The Census Bureau will release business formations statistics for 2023 this summer.)\nThe government tracks a business formation when an application is filed for an employment identification number, or EIN.

But economists watch the data for patterns to discern changes.\nThe trends clearly show positive developments for Prince George's County.\nAlthough Prince George\u2019s has long been home to some high-level research centers and federal government agencies, it also has many low-income communities and higher rates of crime than neighboring counties. The county has pockets with high rates of poverty, but also affluent communities.\nPrince George\u2019s median average household income was about $98,000 in 2022, according to the Census Bureau. That was higher than the national average of $75,000 but lower than the neighboring counties of Montgomery at $126,000; Fairfax, Virginia, at $129,000 and Washington, D.C., at $102,000.\nNot only is the county seeing growth in startups, it\u2019s welcoming agencies and companies relocating from Washington, D.C., and neighboring counties in Maryland and Virginia.\nMost notably, the federal government announced late last year that the FBI\u2019s long-awaited new headquarters will be built in Prince George\u2019s, a major win for the county which beat out bids from Virginia. The FBI is expected to be a draw for a new crop of cybersecurity companies.\nThe county is already home to several new security firms, including Wave Welcome, which was founded in 2020 by Vennard Wright.\nPrior to starting Wave Welcome, Wright held a number of senior technology positions for organizations and was the director of technology for Hillary Clinton\u2019s re-election campaign for U.S. senator from New York in 2006 and for her unsuccessful presidential run in 2008.\nWright started Wave Welcome to provide technology and cybersecurity services to smaller and mid-sized companies, nonprofit organizations and universities.\nSuch establishments \u201ctypically don't have access to high level technology expertise, because they can't afford it,\u201d said Wright. \u201cWe make it so that they have access to the technologies and cybersecurity best practices to keep them secure from data breaches and ransomware attacks.\u201d\nIn May 2023, Wright and his wife Janelle started a second company called PerVista, which uses artificial intelligence to analyze video streams in an effort to spot and prevent gun violence. (See related story.)\nWright, who is African American and a Prince George\u2019s County native, says he was motivated to start his company to \u201cleverage technology to build wealth for minority communities.\u201d\nInterns working at Wave Welcome, a Black-owned company that provides cybersecurity services to small and mid-sized companies. (Courtesy of Janelle Wright/Wave Welcome)\nDavid Iannucci, president and CEO of Prince George\u2019s County Economic Development Corporation, says the growth in new technology businesses isn\u2019t an accident.\n\u201cGoing back more than 10 years, we analyzed the county\u2019s retention rate for these companies and saw room for improvement,\u201d he said.\nThe development corporation started to provide greater support to startups and small businesses, such as providing information about funding and hosting workshops and networking events.\nSome already existing tech companies are relocating to Prince George's as well, in part to take advantage of lower real estate costs but also to be an early arrival in what some believe will be a new tech hub and to take advantage of services provided by economic development agencies.\n\u201cI originally started my company in Northern Virginia, and I realized there's a million other little companies just like mine that are vying for the same resources and vying for attention,\u201d said Husein Sharaf, the 36-year old founder and chief executive of Cloudforce, a computer consulting firm that specializes in the Microsoft cloud operating system, primarily for Fortune 500 corporations.\nSharaf founded Cloudforce in 2010 as a one-man operation before moving its home-base to Prince George\u2019s in 2014.\n\u201cIt's just less crowded,\u201d Sharaf said. \u201cWhich ultimately means there's more (funding) per business that's eligible\u2026 there's more attention here if you know how to network.\u201d\nThe Washington Business Journal named Cloudforce one of the region\u2019s best companies to work for three consecutive years.\nThe company has 65 full time employees working from offices at National Harbor, the large business and entertainment complex on the Potomac River just across the line from the District of Columbia.\nSharaf estimates that he\u2019s paying 25% to 30% less for office space in Prince George\u2019s when compared to other nearby locations.\n\u201cFinding similar space in Northern Virginia or D.C. that's Class A waterfront and as nice as National Harbor is going to be obviously much more expensive,\u201d he added.\nSharaf is hoping that as the number of technology businesses in the county grows, the image of the county will improve, encouraging more funders and venture capitalists to take notice.\n\u201cJust having a tech ecosystem in the county is good for us because it makes people actually want to come here and stay here and work here,\u201d Sharaf said. \u201cOne of the issues that this county has had historically, is that people don't really see it as being one of those places. So the more activity that we have that is public, the more I think we start to create a name for this area.\u201d\n*How the government counts business formations:\nThe formations data is not a perfect measure for startups, although the numbers are followed closely to interpret trends. The government tracks when an application is filed for an employment identification number (EIN,) the first step toward starting a business and hiring employees. Just as every worker needs a Social Security number, every business that plans to hire employees or files taxes as a corporation or partnership needs an EIN. Not every entity that receives an EIN actually creates a business, but the sharp increase in applications in the past decade is an indication of growing interest in business ownership.\n\nRELATED STORIES\nA look at Black-owned startups in Prince George's:\n\u2022 Tetragram helps cannabis users keep track of products\n\u2022 PerVista aims to prevent active shooters"},

The trip to the SBA center last week normally would have been impossible given her salon\u2019s busy schedule.

(Photo courtesy Ricshay Johnson.)\nThe cargo ship Dali lost power and collided with the Key Bridge, bringing down the main span of the 1.6-mile bridge into the Patapsco River, and clogging a main access point to the Port of Baltimore. Six construction workers died in the collapse. The potential economic impact is vast, since the Port of Baltimore directly and indirectly employs some 51,000 people, more than the population of Annapolis. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it hopes to clear the channel and fully reopen the port by the end of May.\nThe Small Business Administration, which seeks to assist small businesses in times of distress, said businesses affected by the bridge collapse may apply for economic injury disaster loans, which have a 4% interest rate for small businesses and 3.25% rate for private nonprofit organizations. Businesses from Maryland, Washington D.C. and select counties from Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia are eligible. Businesses can wait a year before beginning to repay the loans, according to Yvette Jeffrey, Small Business Administration spokesperson.\nThe SBA opened emergency relief centers at the Community College of Baltimore County\u2019s Dundalk Campus, the CareFirst Engagement Center on South Clinton Street in Baltimore, and at the Arundel Christian Church in Glen Burnie.\nJuan Proa\u00f1o, chief executive officer of The League of United Latin American Citizens, a civil rights organization, has raised more than $40,000 through an online GoFundMe fundraising campaign for the families of the six victims as of April 9. Proano, who accompanied President Joe Biden and Gov. Wes Moore on their April 5 visit to Baltimore, said these donations only meet some basic needs for the deceased workers\u2019 families.\n\u201cThese families are going to have to pay the electric bill by the end of the month, they\u2019re gonna have to pay rent by the end of the month,\u201d said Proano. \u201cThese Latino men are the primary wage earners in those homes, right.

President Biden pledged to expedite the bridge's rebuilding using union labor and American steel, while the Port of Baltimore is expected to partially reopen by April-end and fully by May-end.", "content": "Despite Maryland\u2019s low unemployment rates, employers are struggling to fill job vacancies and the workforce\u2019s blue-collar sector is especially stressed. Job seekers lack the specialized skills demanded by the market, which could make it challenging to find qualified local workers for the reconstruction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, according to economists.\n\u201cWe will see this play out as Baltimore works to reconstruct the bridge. There will be a visible lack of local skills,\u201d said Anirban Basu, an economist, chairman, and CEO of Baltimore-based Sage Policy Group.\nIn a press conference on Friday, President Biden addressed the public about the reconstruction of the Key Bridge after he took an aerial tour of the disaster site in Baltimore. He said the government will go to all lengths to ensure the bridge is reconstructed as fast as possible, and they\u2019ll do so with \u201cunion labor and American steel.\u201d\nThe bridge collapse has halted all shipping traffic in the Port of Baltimore, a significant economic asset for Maryland and the United States. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced the port is projected to partially open by the end of April, and fully open by the end of May.\nOver time, major urban centers central to Maryland\u2019s economy, like Baltimore, transitioned from predominantly blue-collar to white-collar cities, said Basu, highlighting the issue when most of the jobs that need to be filled are blue-collar, especially in a post-disaster era of rebuilding.\nIn Maryland, many businesses are grappling with a shortage of candidates, starkly contrasting the promising picture painted by the low unemployment rate.\nIn the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, employers reopened businesses and new businesses emerged, but large numbers of people didn\u2019t return to the workforce, resulting in a dip in participation, one of the critical factors to Maryland\u2019s labor market woes.\nData from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that Maryland\u2019s labor force participation rate has yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels. It hovered at 65.3% as of October 2023, down from 69.3% in December 2019.\n\nMaryland accumulated national attention in 2023 for its low unemployment rate, which hit a record low of 2.3 percent in September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nToday's unemployment rate in Maryland is around 2.4 percent, up 0.1 percent from 2023. This means people may be losing their jobs, according to Basu.\nDue to demographic changes, the aging of the population, skill set mismatches, a lack of general workforce training, and both existing and projected labor shortages, finding competent workers is getting more challenging on a national level, according to the Maryland Governor\u2019s Workforce Investment Board in Maryland\u2019s Labor Force Conditions report.\n\nThe exit of workers from the job force leaves many businesses scrambling to find qualified individuals to meet their staffing needs. The less people actively looking for jobs, the lower unemployment will be.\n\n \nMaryland had the most significant change in the country's unemployment rate last year, with a 0.9 percent decrease.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of workers, of skilled workers and an overall shortage of the skill sets needed for these blue-collar jobs that are open,\u201d said Basu.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are an estimated 3.1 job openings for every job seeker in the state, compared to just 1.3 openings nationally. This highlights Maryland's labor market imbalance.\n\u2018\u201c...many Marylanders lack the basic education and skills necessary to succeed in the workforce.\nMaryland\u2019s challenge is to maintain its highly educated and skilled workforce while creating\nopportunities for all Marylanders to participate and succeed in the 21st-century workplace,\u201d the labor force conditions report states.\nHoward County has the highest workforce participation rate in Maryland, at 56 percent. Somerset County comes in last place, with only 36% of its population employed, or actively searching for work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember this failure to fill jobs doesn\u2019t mean the market is loosening. It might be bifurcating as 2024 moves on and unemployment slowly rises,\u201d Basu said, \u201cFor this lack of skilled workers to fix itself, there needs to be more of a push to learn the skills needed.\u201d"},

The organization told CNBC in 2023 that $550 million in densification upgrades had gone into the terminal since its establishment.\n\u201cBaltimore is able to accommodate some of the world\u2019s largest ships because of its 50-foot-deep channel and its supersized, Neo-Panamax cranes,\u201d Scher said in the email.\nNeo-Panamax cranes are bigger and stronger than their predecessors, helping them deal with the larger ships that can now pass through the Panama Canal,\nAuto and Machinery Increases\nThe Port of Baltimore\u2019s public terminals now deal with substantially more automotive shipping than it did before, per the MPA data.\nThat has increased the amount of roll on/roll off cargo it handles, including dump trucks, harvesters, rollers and more, per Scher.

Massachusetts passed a law in 2022 that requires a 4 percent income tax on those who earn more than $1 million annually.\nAdvocates for businesses are worried that the bill would threaten corporations and small businesses and might even deter them from operating in Maryland.\nAside from the bill sponsors, though, most Maryland officials are not jumping at the chance to raise taxes this election year. Democratic Gov. Wes Moore introduced a 2025 fiscal year budget that is balanced without any tax increases. This is despite the fact that the state is projected to face a deficit of $1.8 billion in 2028 if it doesn\u2019t dramatically change its spending and revenue habits.\nThe deficit might threaten Maryland\u2019s ability to keep some of its most important state programs adequately funded, advocates say.\n\u201cWe see looming holes in the budget that need to be dealt with. Otherwise, we\u2019re going to have to start cutting things,\u201d Del. Julie Palakovich Carr, D-Montgomery, the sponsor of the House bill said.\nHealth care, education and transportation all depend on state funding, said Kali Schumitz of the Maryland Center on Economic Policy. The budget deficit might inhibit the state\u2019s ability to keep money flowing toward these initiatives, Schumitz said.\nThe revenue raised by the bill, known as the Fair Share Maryland for Act of 2024, aims to address these concerns. A major goal of the bill is to increase income taxes for Marylanders who earn more than $250,000 a year.\nThe bill would also reduce taxes for lower-income earners by expanding Maryland\u2019s Child Tax Credit, Schumitz added. The additional funds would make more people eligible for the tax credit by increasing the maximum earning level allowed.\u00a0\n\u201cThis would increase the number of kids benefitting from the credit, which is a really powerful anti-poverty tool,\u201d Schumitz said.\nChild tax credits would assist working families, bringing economic relief to those who need it most, said Terry Cavanagh from SEIU 500, a public sector workers union, told lawmakers in the Senate bill hearing on Wednesday.\nThe increased income taxes would go toward the state\u2019s general fund, and lawmakers can use their discretion to decide where the funding should go, said Palakovich Carr.\nEconomic justice advocates are urging lawmakers to consider using the revenue on education. If not, schools could be left severely underfunded, said Shamoyia Gardiner, Executive Director of Strong Schools Maryland, a grassroots educational organization. A similar fate is possible for the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, an initiative that is fully funded only for the next couple of years, Gardiner added.\nOther advocates think lawmakers should use it to support housing affordability and assistance, as these initiatives go hand-in-hand with education, Schumitz said. \u201cThere\u2019s an increasing recognition that all these things are interconnected,\u201d Schumitz added.\nThe bottom line for some lawmakers is that, regardless of where funds may be used, the tax system is in need of restructuring.\n\u201cOur tax system is upside down. The wealthiest 1 percent of Marylanders, people making over $700,300 a year, pay a smaller share of their income in state and local taxes than people in any other income group,\u201d Schumitz said.\nThe bill is a way to \u201ccheck and rebalance the fairness\u201d of Maryland\u2019s tax system and re-evaluate funding state programs, Hettleman said.\nUnlike in some other states, this initiative has not been labeled a millionaires tax because the tax increase would impact some high earners who make less than $1 million.\nThe impact on tax rates wouldn\u2019t be as drastic as it seems, some advocates say. \u201cMore people are actually getting a tax cut than a tax increase under this bill,\u201d Christopher Meyer, a research analyst at the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, said.\u00a0\nThe bill also aims to close corporate tax loopholes that allow big corporations to file taxes in places that don\u2019t charge a corporate income tax, avoiding paying the income taxes they owe in Maryland, Schumitz said.\nThe legislation would address this by requiring parent corporations to file a combined tax return, reflecting the income of all its subsidiaries as one entity for tax purposes.\nHowever, opponents of this bill raised concerns about the use of this so-called \u201ccombined reporting.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThere is no guarantee that mandatory worldwide combined reporting would actually increase state revenues, and certainly would not create a stable revenue stream,\u201d Leonore Heavey, a senior tax counsel with the Council On State Taxation, told lawmakers in the Senate bill hearing.\nOther opponents were concerned that enforcing combined reporting would discourage small businesses from continuing to operate in Maryland.\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at tax policy that discourages entrepreneurship and the expansion and even creation of small businesses here in Maryland,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Halloran, the Maryland State Director of the National Federation of Independent Business.\n\u201cThe state is facing a lot of fiscal issues. There are a lot of priorities that this administration and the prior administration laid out, that you all are now having to deal with how we pay for it. So it might be better for the body to pursue this than a roughly $1 billion tax hike over the next few years,\u201d O\u2019Halloran said."},

Ever since, it has been the home of the Southern Maryland Blue Claws of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.\nSupporters forecast that the stadium would spur economic growth in the wealthy, rural community which surrounds it. Ten years later, the economic and demographic changes are mixed.\n\nUsing data from the American Community Survey, the Povich Center found that by 2018, both tax revenues and population surrounding the ballpark nearly tripled, while rents increased by 31%. Residents of the area briefly also became more educated, though that change has largely reversed. Income levels experienced a modest decline, while housing valuations fell sharply.\nMeasuring the impact of a baseball stadium is complicated. Regency Furniture Stadium opened amid the crash of the housing market and a global recession. Trends observed in Waldorf are not necessarily predictors for other minor league ballparks like the one scheduled to open in Hagerstown in Spring 2024.\nHowever, Waldorf could provide insight into economic change resulting from the new ballpark in Hagerstown. Supporters are predicting that the publicly funded, $70-million stadium will revitalize the city\u2019s downtown district.\n\u201cI expect all four of those categories to go up: property values, property taxes, income among the residents and the education level of people moving into the downtown,\u201d said Dan Spedden, president of the Hagerstown/Washington County Convention and Visitors Bureau.\nHere\u2019s a further look at how economic and demographic conditions shifted near Regency Furniture Stadium, the last publicly financed, independent league baseball stadium built in Maryland:\nThe population soared but was not the sole contributor of growth in the city.\nThough the population near the site of Regency Furniture Stadium nearly tripled between 2008 and 2018, it still underperformed growth measured in Waldorf, suggesting that the stadium was not the sole driver of population growth in the city.\n\nTax revenues near the stadium site nearly tripled.\nBy 2018, properties near the stadium were generating $11.6 million in real estate tax revenue for the local government, nearly three times as much as the $4.1 million collected in 2008. Over that period, tax revenues near the stadium grew 4.5 times more than they did in the city and twice as much as a nearby community.\nA more educated demographic moved near the stadium, but they did not stay.\nIn the first five years after Regency Furniture Stadium opened, the number of individuals with a bachelor\u2019s degree who lived near the stadium jumped nearly 9 percentage points. Over the next five years, there was a decline of 7 percentage points. By 2018, the growth in education levels near the stadium resembled that of the city and underperformed a neighborhood community.\nAmid a housing crisis and global recession, property values declined dramatically.\nHousing prices plummeted after the crash of the housing market in 2008 triggered a global recession. Between 2008 and 2018, valuations near Regency Furniture Stadium fell by 26%, comparable to the decline city-wide but worse than the decline in a nearby community.\nRents continued to climb in an already expensive area\nWhen Regency Furniture Stadium opened, the median rent price for a property near the stadium was $1,437, 15% higher than the median rent for the city. By 2018, rents had jumped nearly 31% to $1,875 and continued to outpace prices in the city and a nearby community.\n\nThe community surrounding the stadium remained wealthy.\nRegency Furniture Stadium was built in a community where the median household income was over $109,000, 25% higher than income levels for the city. Ten years later, households around the stadium experienced a modest decline in income but remained 13% wealthier than incomes in the city.\nAbout this analysis:\nData was obtained through the American Community Survey, a yearly supplement to the decennial census that collects information about education, housing and the economy, among other variables. The area around Regency Furniture Stadium was defined as the census tract containing the stadium. Census tracts are the smallest geographic units available for studying the variables in this analysis. They are defined as subdivisions of counties that contain up to 8,000 people. Additional analysis was completed for the city and a bordering census tract with a similar demographic profile."},

They had the highest toddler and preschool child care median prices in the state in 2022 at $15,350. For families in these counties, child care could represent 10% and 11% of their income respectively, based on a median family income of over $120,000 in both counties.\n\nThe increase in child care prices may hit some families harder than others, depending on where they live. In Baltimore City and Somerset County, yearly toddler and preschool care median prices are $10,922 and $7,521 respectively, according to the data. That represents 17% and 13% of median family incomes in those areas, much higher than other parts of the state.\nAccording to Landivar, the District of Columbia has some of the highest child care prices in the United States, with nearby counties in Virginia and Maryland also having high prices in comparison to the rest of the country, even after accounting for income disparities.\n\u201cIn some counties, the family incomes are quite a bit lower. That doesn\u2019t mean that the child care price declines by that same amount,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if you have families that have lower income, it becomes unaffordable for them. It\u2019s consuming a larger share of their income.\u201d\n\nLandivar cites the impact of the pandemic on the child-care workforce on costs in Maryland.\n\u201cThroughout the pandemic, Maryland experienced a lot of losses in child care spaces. [It has] one of the slowest recoveries,\u201d she said.\nA study from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services looking at the impact of the pandemic on the child care industry, shows that Maryland \u2013 one of the states \u201cwhere the child care industry was hit hardest\u201d \u2013 had a 44% decline in employees in child care during the height of the pandemic, according to the study. As a result, Maryland and other hard hit states, \u201csaw slower recovery\u201d by June 2022.\nThe study showed that Maryland also had an 8.4% decrease in child care programs from the height of the pandemic to the second quarter of 2022, the highest decrease in the country.\n\u201cMaryland has pretty high labor force participation \u2026 for women, and at the same time, you don\u2019t have enough child care supply. So, it becomes a real issue,\u201d Landivar said.\nIn turn, the wages of the child care industry, which were already low to begin with according to Landivar, increased. In the first quarter of 2020, Maryland child care employees on average received a weekly wage of $563. That increased to $621 in the second quarter of 2022, according to the study.\nHawaii, Arizona, Alaska and the District of Columbia were also among the locations that were hit the hardest by the pandemic and had a slow recovery.\n\n\u201cIn some counties, the family incomes are quite a bit lower. That doesn\u2019t mean that the child care price declines by that same amount,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if you have families that have lower income, it becomes unaffordable for them. It\u2019s consuming a larger share of their income.\u201d\n\nConversations about making child care more affordable to lower income families are taking place at a national level.\nJust last month, the Biden administration passed an executive order that would increase access to child care by making HHS \u201cconsider issuing regulations to pursue policies to reduce child care costs for families\u201d and encourage states to increase the use of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds and spend more on cash assistance for families.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a known issue that child care is quite expensive for families throughout the country, but especially so for families that have lower income,\u201d said Landivar.\nOn a statewide level, Maryland has scholarships in place that provide financial assistance with child care costs to families that are working and are recipients of Temporary Cash Assistance, Supplemental Security Income, or make a certain amount of money, through the Child Care Scholarship Program."},

As of January 2023, the consumer price index (CPI) had risen 6.4% over the previous 12 months, and stipend amounts have often not kept up. Only a small number of college and university stipends surpass the living wage in their area, many of which are private institutions.\nGraduate students typically work a set number of hours per week as graduate assistants or teacher\u2019s assistants and receive a stipend based on research or other work they are performing for a university. Stipends typically increase annually \u2013 some at a faster rate than others. There are many factors that play into how much these students make, but typically, PhD students are awarded the highest pay.\nDespite the stipend, basic necessities are often a financial burden to grad students. A 2020 study conducted by graduate students at the University of Albany found that graduate students are at a higher risk of mental health issues as a result of food insecurity. Food insecurity was reported by 59.7% of participants, as well as higher levels of anxiety, stress, and depression.\nCNS collected data about stipends for biology students from fifty doctoral programs at colleges and universities across the United States from the individual school\u2019s websites. In the chart below, we compare that data to the cost of living in the county where the school is located, using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Living Wage Calculator. The highest living wage of the surveyed schools is $53,332 in New York County and the lowest is $31,737 in Montgomery County, Ohio.\nResearchers from the University of Florida collected similar data comparing graduate stipends to living wage. Their data can be found here. \n\n \nStanford University boasts the highest graduate stipend at $48,216 per year, however the cost of living in Santa Clara County, California is $55,860. The lowest stipend amount from the surveyed schools is $13,000 at Wright State University, compared to a cost of living of $31,737 in Montgomery County, Ohio. In 6% of the surveyed schools, students are making less than half of the living wage for their county.\nThe University of Maryland, College Park offers a starting stipend of $29,591.74 annually for doctoral biology students, which falls $16,811.26 below the living wage in Prince George\u2019s County. A 2022 University of Maryland survey indicated that 47% of graduate students felt cost burdened.\nOnly 10% of surveyed schools offer their students a stipend that exceeds the cost of living in their area. The average living wage amongst the schools in the data set is $38,939, and the average stipend is $30,904, a 21% deficit\nIn 2022, 50,000 academic workers from University of California (UC) schools rallied together to express their concerns about the low stipend they\u2019re offered verse the high cost of living in California, according to a recent article in the Los Angeles Times. The union representing teaching assistants and researchers reached an agreement with UC administrators which would raise the stipend amount, but students will still fall short of California\u2019s living wage.\n\nUniversity of Texas (UT) students came together to speak out against low wages and poor working conditions during a \u201cgrade in\u201d which took place in December 2022, according to The Daily Texan, the UT Austin student newspaper. Students gathered outside the campus tower, chanting their demands.\nCollective bargaining is the process in which a group of workers come together and negotiate with their superiors for better overall working conditions. Not all states allow for collective bargaining. Nine states prohibit public sector employees from unionizing, including Texas, North Carolina, and South Carolina. A vast majority of states have the right to collective bargaining, but each institution can choose whether or not they want to allow it.\n\n \nIn states like Maryland, collective bargaining laws only cover certain higher level institutions. University System of Maryland (USM) students are prohibited from forming a union. Graduate student groups, including Fearless Student Employees (FSA), and United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS), are actively trying to change this.\nSen. Benjamin Kramer, D-Montgomery County, recently proposed SB0247, which would grant all USM schools, as well as Morgan State University and St. Mary\u2019s College of Maryland, the right to unionize. It extends beyond just graduate students, and includes faculty as well.\nAt a hearing on February 16, Kramer explained that giving students this right is important so they can be recognized by the University for the hard work that they do.\n\u201cWe have an outstanding university system here,\u201d said Kramer, during the Senate meeting, \u201cwhat I find disturbing and embarrassing is that we do not allow the hardworking women and men who are the ones who have made the university system so outstanding \u2026we don't afford them the opportunity to bargain collectively\u201d\nSteve Fetter, the Dean of the Graduate School at the University of Maryland, has testified against this bill and against similar bills in the past.\nThis bill is currently in committee, and is one of twenty four proposed across the country in 2022 that would allow public school employees to unionize.\n\nMethodology: CNS collected salary data from individual school websites. Living wage data was collected using the MIT Living Wage calculator to get an accurate living wage for each school's surrounding area based on the county where the school is located. The framework for the data featured in this story was inspired by similar data collected by graduate students at the University of Florida, found here."},

One of DeWitt\u2019s newest ventures has been assisting in the creation of a 1\u00bd-acre urban organic farm called Strength to Love II to give citizens access to fresh, organic produce.\nOne part of the Strength to Love II farm.

So I said, \u2018Well, what can we do to combat all of that with one swoop?\u2019 \u201d\nMore than 10,000 people live in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood, but there are no grocery stores with fresh produce or meat within a mile of the area, according to The Baltimore Sun.\nDeWitt, working with a coalition called Clergy United for the Transformation of Sandtown (CUTS), saw Strength to Love II as the answer. They started with a small greenhouse and hired people recently released from incarceration, whom DeWitt called \u201creturning citizens.\u201d The project now provides vegetables and fruit to a community that struggles as a food desert.\nBernard Warren, executive director of CUTS, said working with DeWitt has been \u201ceye-opening.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI think that overall it\u2019s not only just his knowledge, but it\u2019s also his leadership and the fact that he\u2019s connected to various different politicians and leaders within the community,\u201d said Warren, 51.\nDeWitt is also director of the Maryland Baptist Aged Home, the only nursing home in the country to have had zero COVID-19 cases throughout the pandemic, according to DeWitt.\nThe 29-bed facility didn\u2019t take any risks when the pandemic began in 2020. DeWitt imposed a lockdown, and collected plenty of personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies for the staff. \u201cWe were excessive, we were extreme, we were emotional,\u201d DeWitt said.\u00a0\nFounded in 1924, the Maryland Baptist Aged Home was originally called the Maryland Baptist Aged Home for Colored People because DeWitt said people of color did not have any other option in the 1920s. The nursing home has struggled in the past and people once avoided it unless there was no other option, DeWitt said. There were financial struggles.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t cash our payroll checks in Walmart even because we had bounced so many payroll checks,\u201d DeWitt said. \u201cFast forward now, we\u2019re one of the top 10 nursing homes in the entire state.

At Martha\u2019s Place, for example, women who successfully complete a drug rehabilitation program can move to an independent living area for a short time while they seek employment and try to reunite with their children, he said.\u00a0\nAmelia Harris, one of the co-founders of the Intersection of Change, said she admires DeWitt\u2019s enthusiasm and energy in the organization.\n\u201cHe\u2019s taken on the burden of our community and working alongside the other partners in helping to eradicate and change some of the systems that\u2019s been in place here in Sandtown,\u201d Harris said.\u00a0\nSome have asked DeWitt how he can wear so many hats.

In-store purchases increased by 12% compared to last year, showing a rebound in physical retail activity post-pandemic, while e-commerce grew even faster at 14%.", "content": "The National Retail Federation predicted that an estimated 166.3 million people would be shopping from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday, including Black Friday. That figure was surpassed by an additional reported 30 million holiday shoppers.\n2022 is a particularly interesting year for retail because it\u2019s the second year after the COVID-19 breakout and in-person shopping is not as restricted as it was during the early days of the pandemic. The Thanksgiving weekend reflected that by showing a 12% growth in in-store purchases, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.\nAnother factor that makes holiday shopping peculiar this year is inflation \u2013 inflation was at a 40-year high in June, driving prices higher and placing consumers at a difficult spot with their finances. Despite that, more than $9 billion was spent on Black Friday online sales.\n\nShoppers set a record-high, spending $9.12 billion online on Black Friday sales, according to Adobe Analytics, despite inflation and looming recession. Most retailers expected lower-than-average profits from this year\u2019s Black Friday sales due to inflation and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes. The rising wave of layoffs from big companies like Amazon and Meta to smaller startups also point at a looming recession that experts predict for the coming years.\nThere was approximately a 2.5% increase in total online shopping revenue for Black Friday this year compared to the previous year, and a 47% increase from 2018. Adobe said the increase wasn\u2019t just because of higher prices but was partly due to growing demand.\n\nOnline sales compared to in-store purchases showed consumers preference for shopping from the comfort of their homes. However, in-person shopping has still seen a rise since 2021, according to Mastercard SpendingPlus. In-store purchases increased by 12% over the Thanksgiving weekend compared to last year, but e-commerce grew even faster, by 14%.\nAccording to the National Retail Federation, a record number of 196.7 million consumers shopped over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend \u2013 from Thanksgiving Day to Cyber Monday \u2013 in both online and in-person stores. This is the highest figure recorded since NRF started tracking the data in 2017. This year had a 9.4% uptick from 2021, equivalent to $17 million more consumers. \n\nCyber Monday has seen higher sales figures than Black Friday at least as far back as 2014, according to Adobe Analytics. This year, Cyber Monday generated a staggering $11.3 billion for retailers, 25% more than Black Friday. Patrick Brown, vice president of marketing and insights at Adobe, told NBC News that this trend \u201cshows no signs of slowing down.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from Adobe Analytics, many shoppers seemed to have reached for their mobile phones to shop during the holiday season. Shopping done by mobile devices contributed to 44% of the total revenue, equivalent to $80 billion dollars, tracked from October 1 to November 28, 2022. Desktops and other devices made up the rest, about $100 billion in revenue.\n\nThe top categories for discounts this year included toys and electronics. Toys like Legos and Hot Wheels and electronics like Apple MacBooks and PlayStation 5 were some of the hottest products of 2022, according to Adobe.

Fast fashion brands like Shein are increasingly favored by Gen Z, influenced by social media trends and influencers.", "content": "Google Trends data shows that ultra-fast fashion clothing retailer Shein is searched more often in states with high poverty percentages. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a very simple answer to that \u2013 Shein is affordable,\u201d said Teju-Adisa Farrar, an independent environmental consultant and researcher, in response to why people in poorer states were searching for Shein. \n\u201cAnd so unfortunately, that means that folks with less money are not necessarily aware [or] even thinking about the climate and environmental impacts because they don\u2019t have a lot of resources to make other choices,\u201d Farrar added.\n\n\nShein is categorized under the umbrella of fast fashion brands along with H&M, Zara, Forever 21 and more. Fast fashion can be defined as clothing that imitates high-end fashion but is cheaper, made of low-quality materials and mass produced. It keeps up with latest trends by sampling catwalk fashion or celebrity culture and caters to customer demand by producing garments with a short turnaround time between trends. In the case of Shein, at least 500 new fashion products are added to their website everyday.\nMany years ago, buying clothes was an event carried out a few times a year but with online shopping, it has become a daily or weekly occurrence for many. The overproduction and overconsumption of clothes has paved the way for throwaway culture where a garment is worn only a few times before being discarded. This has led to excessive textile waste which is either burned or dumped in the ocean, polluting the environment.\nDespite the many cons, fast fashion brands have been increasingly popular with Gen Z. Social media like TikTok, Instagram and YouTube are flooded with clothing hauls by influencers who promote these brands, sponsored or not. Hashtags like #SheinHaul and #ZaraHaul have billions of views on TikTok, ultimately prompting viewers to invest in these clothes.\n\nStates like Mississippi, West Virginia and Arkansas rank first, fourth and fifth in the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s regions with high percentages of people in poverty. The same states are the top three states with high Google search interest in Shein. \nAffordability could be the major drive behind this overlap of poor states being highly interested in the low-cost clothing retailer. For example, a dress on sale costs as little as $2.90 on Shein\u2019s U.S. website.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re working class, if you live in poverty, and the only way that you can feel better about yourself is through material excess and you don\u2019t have access to that, then you\u2019re going to constantly [feel] so devalued by society,\u201d said Farrar, adding that consumerism in America is an economic, environmental and a psychosomatic issue.\n\nShein steadily rose in the international market with its low-cost, trendy apparel and online-only business model. The company was valued at $100 billion in a funding round earlier this year, according to Bloomberg. That figure is worth more than H&M and Zara combined \u2013 two fast-fashion giants that were market leaders before Shein took over.\nWith increasing success in the U.S., Shein announced plans to establish three distribution centers in the coming years to ensure faster shipping times for its American customers. Currently, the e-commerce startup has operations in Guangzhou, Singapore and Los Angeles and reaches more than 150 countries with their goods. More than 6,000 new fashion, beauty and lifestyle products are delivered on a daily basis, according to Shein\u2019s press release.\nDespite its astronomical success, allegations of environmental damage, worker exploitation, and copyright theft have been shrouding the company\u2019s image. In an attempt to combat them, Shein announced their commitment to reduce \u201cabsolute GHG emissions across its entire value chain\u201d by 25% by 2030. \nBy doing so, they revealed their business\u2019 carbon footprint for 2021 \u2013 Shein produced approximately 6.3 million tonnes of CO2 in 2021 which is equivalent to almost 7 billion pounds of coal burned, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Shein said that a large part of their environmental impact is generated in the supply chain which includes sourcing materials, manufacturing, and product distribution.\n\nIn 2019, the United Nations has reported that the fashion industry is responsible for 8-10% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than the aviation and shipping sectors combined.\nAccording to the EPA, around 85% of all textiles thrown away in the country are either dumped into landfills or burned. \n\u201cA lot of the secondhand clothing ends up in landfills [\u2026] and the rest of it goes to places like Haiti and Ghana and their secondhand clothing market which is overrun by clothes from Western countries.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not sustainable environmentally, but also socially, it\u2019s not sustainable because we can\u2019t keep consuming at this amount because then you\u2019re never satisfied,\u201d Farrar, who is an honoree for the 2022 Conscious Fashion Campaign by New York Fashion Week, added.\nDuring the Global Fashion Summit held in Copenhagen in June, Shein had announced a $15 million donation to a non-profit working with textile workers in Ghana. The global charitable entity, Greenpeace International addressed the donation via a tweet, calling it \u201cnothing more than a #greenwashing stunt.\u201d \n\nA few days ago, @SHEIN_Official announced a $15m donation to an NGO working with textile waste workers in Ghana.\nBut without any drastic change to its ultra-fast-fashion model, this is in fact nothing more than a #greenwashing stunt.#DetoxMyFashion https://t.co/kT1O2y6vMx\n\u2014 Greenpeace (@Greenpeace) June 13, 2022\n\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything Shein could do to better themselves.

Check cashers collectively sold nearly $36 million in lottery products across the state from 2017 through 2020, according to state records.\nDozens of other Massachusetts businesses not licensed as check cashers but with names strongly suggesting they offer check-cashing services \u2014 such as Alltown Check Cashing in Quincy and Plaisance Check Cashing in Dorchester \u2014 sold more than $7 million in lottery products during the same time period, state records show.   \nLicensed check cashers are frequently located in low-income Hispanic communities where most residents have a high school diploma or less, U.S. Census data shows. The businesses have long been criticized for preying on the poor and those lacking access to traditional financial services.  \nCheck casher lottery sales are a small fraction of the billions generated each year in Massachusetts through ticket purchases. But in a state where six out of every 10 people play the lottery, an alluring mix of quick cash and lottery games poses a dangerous financial risk for customers, said former Massachusetts Inspector General Gregory W. Sullivan.  \nLotteries are nothing more than \u201cgovernment-sponsored gambling,\u201d Sullivan said.\nSince its establishment in 1971, the Massachusetts lottery has generated $137 billion in revenue and awarded over $96 billion in prizes, state records show. To draw customers, the state Lottery Commission says 72% of lottery revenue goes to prize payouts.\nMassachusetts residents pay more per capita on lottery tickets than individuals in any other state, according to a study conducted in 2017 by LendEDU.\n\u201cCheck-cashing stores are the quintessential example of a magnet to low-income people \u2026 people who are on their last dollars and they need money now to pay the rent, buy food,\u201d said Sullivan, now director of research at the Pioneer Institute, a nonprofit government accountability organization in Boston. \u201cThey are at the end of the financial line.\u201d\nMimi Turchinetz, assistant deputy director of the Boston Mayor\u2019s Office of Financial Empowerment, labeled the lottery a \u201crabbit hole\u201d for low- and moderate-income citizens.\n\u201cPeople participate in the lottery with stars in their eyes and hope that it\u2019ll make them rich when they\u2019re spending their hard-earned money,\u201d Turchinetz said. \u201cThe chances of hitting the lottery are probably smaller than the chances of getting hit by lightning.\u201d\nIn 1997, Massachusetts legislators proposed but failed to pass legislation that would ban Keno at check-cashing stores. That same year, a study by the Division of Banks showed individuals using check-cashing services paid considerably more in fees than those who used traditional banks.\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, former Democratic state Rep. Michael W. Morrissey, said allowing the highly addictive Keno games at those locations heightened the financial risks for the state\u2019s poorer residents using check cashers.\n\u201cMy belief was that people who were using check-cashing services may have been people who didn\u2019t have access to banking services or might be members of the immigrant community,\u201d said Morrissey, now the Norfolk County district attorney. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense to me to make it that readily available.\u201d\nKeno, first authorized for play in Massachusetts in 1993, has emerged as a lucrative lottery product. From 2017 through 2020, Massachusetts Keno winners reaped over $553 million in prizes, state records show.\nState law requires that check cashers obtain a license to operate from the Division of 2017 Keno claimsBanks. The licensees must renew their license each year.\nEight check-cashing store owners and managers contacted for this story declined to speak with reporters about their lottery ticket sales.\nSome businesses cashing checks and selling lottery products have been sanctioned in recent years for operating illegally.\nMayfair Foods Inc., in the Allston neighborhood of Boston, sold almost $283,000 in lottery products in 2017,  sales data shows. The Division of Banks issued a cease-and-desist order in September 2017 to Mayfair Foods Inc. for cashing customer checks without a license, state records show.\nIn March 2020, the Division of Banks issued a cease-and-desist order to Low Price Convenience Store in Fall River for operating without a check-cashing license, state records show. The store sold $1.7 million in lottery products in 2020, lottery sales records show.  \nFor some who frequent licensed check-cashing stores, the gamble is worth it. At All Checks Cashed in Everett, one customer recalled spending her last few dollars during the 2004 Christmas season on the lottery \u2014 only to score a rare $250,000 win.\n\u201cI had $15, and I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to put $10 in gas,\u2019\u201d said Yessie, a middle-aged Hispanic mother who declined to give her last name. She\u2019d go on to spend the remaining $5 on two Mega Millions tickets purchased at a Lawrence gas station. \u201cI was almost broke.\u201d \nWhile Yessie won big, that is not the case for most who gamble with the lottery.\nTurchinetz called the lottery and check-cashing services financial \u201cextractors\u201d that undermine people\u2019s wealth. However, she said the lottery is a game, and buyers can make their own decisions when it comes to spending their income.\n\u201cPeople are adults,\u201d Turchinetz said. \u201cThey know what they\u2019re participating in, and so it\u2019s patronizing to suggest that you should remove them.\u201d\nSullivan said lottery officials and lawmakers need to revisit the ability of check-cashing stores to sell lottery products, including reviewing effects on low-income buyers.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not being counted, it\u2019s not being noticed,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cI think if that is put right in the face of legislators, they could try to take action to ameliorate it.\u201d\nThis story was produced by students in Boston University Professor Maggie Mulvihill\u2019s Data Journalism class in collaboration with The Howard Center for Investigative Journalism."},

This expansion is fueled by aggressive advertising and sales strategies, with state governments becoming increasingly dependent on lottery revenues.", "content": "WARREN, Mich. \u2014 While the growing expansion of casinos and state-sanctioned sports betting steal the spotlight, state lotteries have nearly doubled in size over the past two decades, driving a multibillion-dollar wealth transfer from low-income U.S. communities to powerful multinational companies.\nA nationwide investigation of state lotteries by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland found that stores that sell tickets are disproportionately clustered in lower-income communities in nearly every state. The investigation\u2019s analysis of cellphone location data shows that the people who patronize those lottery retailers come from the same kinds of communities.\nOnce rare, lotteries now operate in all but five U.S. states. Driven by more than a half-billion dollars in annual ad spending, increasingly sophisticated sales strategies and political pressure to increase revenue, lottery ticket sales have grown from $47 billion to $82 billion since 2005. In 10 states, lotteries generate more revenue than corporate income taxes.\nThe investigation also found that a key promise of lotteries across the country \u2014 that they support education \u2014 doesn\u2019t hold up. Instead, lotteries often compound inequities by disproportionately benefiting college students and wealthier school districts far from the neighborhoods that fund ticket sales.\n\u201cPoor people are collateral damage to a cause of raising money for what the legislators feel is good purposes \u2026 public safety, local schools,\u201d said Gregory W. Sullivan, former Massachusetts inspector general and now research director for the Pioneer Institute, a free-market think tank. \u201cState governments become dependent on the revenue and any moral considerations get pushed out of view and out of mind.\u2019\u2019\nThe multibillion-dollar wealth transfer starts in places like Warren, Michigan, where Ashley Standifer buys tickets in one of the state\u2019s poorest neighborhoods.\nThe Korner Party Store in Warren, Michigan, on April 18, 2022. Ashley Standifer bought scratch-off lottery tickets from the store in April. The store, which sold $1.7 million worth of lottery tickets in 2020, is located in the Van Dyke school district, where the majority of students are Black and/or qualify for free-or-reduced-price lunch, and also receive the minimum amount of per-pupil funding from the state. (Alexandra Macia/Howard Center for Investigative Journalism)\nOn a snowy day in April, Standifer stopped by the Korner Party Store in this Detroit suburb, its largest sign advertising \u201cBeer Wine Lotto,\u201d to buy scratch-off tickets.\nShe buys scratch tickets three times daily, alternating between the Korner Party Store and a cluster of nearby gas stations and convenience stores. She said she won $1,000 on a $3 ticket four years ago, but she hasn\u2019t won big since.\n\u201cOf course, you know, I\u2019m expecting to get my money back,\u201d Standifer said. \u201cBut if I don\u2019t, it\u2019s just fine. I\u2019m still gonna buy it.\u201d\nStandifer\u2019s spending is one small part of the $82 billion now spent annually by lottery players, the first input in a nearly nationwide system that brings state-sponsored gambling directly into a majority of U.S. neighborhoods through more than 200,000 retail stores.\nStandifer \u2014 and millions of players like her across the country \u2014 get about 65 cents on the dollar back as winnings. Put another way, they lose about 35 cents for every dollar they spend. Those losses are why the lottery exists.\n\u201cYesterday I spent like $130 and I won like $85,\u201d Standifer said on that snowy April day.\nThe $45 Standifer lost will leave this neighborhood north of Detroit, just a sliver of the $29 billion lost annually by players in the 45 states (plus Washington, D.C.) that have a lottery. Those losses fund government programs and enrich others, such as a Canadian private equity billionaire and a Japanese convenience-store conglomerate that profits from more than 10,000 U.S. lottery retailers.\nIn the popular imagination, the lottery is funded by people who spend a few dollars on a Powerball ticket when the jackpot gets big. This is not reality.\nMore than two-thirds of lottery sales are of instant scratch-off tickets \u2014 the same type Standifer bought \u2014 which range in price from $1 to $50. A sliver of players are responsible for most of that spending.\nA 1999 report to the National Gambling Impact Study Commission found that the top 10% of lottery spenders accounted for two-thirds of all sales. The most frequent players, the study found, were disproportionately composed of people who were Black, lower-income or high school dropouts.\nHigh school dropouts spent four times more per year on the lottery than college graduates. Black people spent, on average, nearly five times as much as white people.\nThe Howard Center submitted public records requests to nearly half of states with lotteries seeking detailed customer studies.\nSome states, like Massachusetts, are fully aware of the importance of frequent players. A 2016 segmentation study commissioned by the state\u2019s lottery showed that the top 10% of players account for about 40% of sales. The average player in that group reported lottery spending of nearly $200 per week.\nWhile the multi-state Powerball and Mega Millions lottery games get the most attention, scratch-off tickets are by far the biggest money makers for state lotteries. More than two-thirds of all lottery spending is on scratch-off games, followed by three- and four-digit numbers games, Keno and other monitor games and in-state lottery games. (Source: La Fleurs\u2019s 2021 World Lottery Almanac 29th Edition | Credit: Jenna Cohen)\nIn South Carolina, players with a household income of less than $35,000 a year spent more than twice as much as players with household incomes between $100,000 and $150,000, according to a 2014 state-commissioned research study obtained by the Howard Center. Black and Hispanic players each spent nearly 20% more than white players.\nCloyd White, 26, is a construction worker from Jasper County, South Carolina. Surrounded by lottery advertisements in one of the state\u2019s Shell gas stations, he said he knows people who would turn to the lottery to try to prevent cash-flow shortages.\n\u201cWhen people get down, they probably take the last 10 or 20 dollars to try to make up 100 to 400 dollars,\u201d said White, who is Black and estimated he spent $40 every day playing the lottery. \u201cIt\u2019s a gamble and it\u2019s risky, but I feel like it\u2019s all about God.\u201d\nThe Howard Center found states are more likely to collect and publish information about their customers that obscures the importance of frequent players. These states collect statistics that show the percentage of a given demographic group that \u201cparticipates\u201d in the lottery each year. In this framework, people who spend $10,000 or $1 a year are considered to have participated equally.\n\u201cFor state lotteries, having access to that data is like taking a giant money-sucking cannon and aiming it at those demographics,\u201d said Les Bernal, national director of Stop Predatory Gambling, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. \u201cIt dictates where they put the lottery retailers. There\u2019s a reason why so many lottery outlets are concentrated in low-income areas across the United States.\u201d\nVeronica Gillard, 52, from New Orleans, said she has spent $30 a week on lottery tickets \u2014 over $1,500 a year \u2014 since the launch of Louisiana\u2019s lottery system in 1991. She drives for Uber and Lyft, styles hair and regularly plays at a gas station in one of Louisiana\u2019s lowest-income communities.\nLouisiana doesn\u2019t know how important players like Gillard are to overall spending, because it doesn\u2019t collect that information.\n\u201cFor advertising and marketing purposes, the Lottery\u2019s target audience has always been Adults 21+ that live in Louisiana, so there is not a purpose for collecting unrelated demographic information,\u201d Kimberly Chopin, Louisiana Lottery Corporation director of communications, said in an email to the Howard Center.\nIn Michigan, where Standifer plays, internal customer studies show that different demographic groups participate in the lottery in proportion to their makeup of the general population. But they do not contain information about average spending by each group.\n\u201cSince Lottery purchases at retail are anonymous transactions, there is no demographic data collected or reported,\u201d Jake Harris, player relations manager at the Michigan Lottery, said in an email. \u201cFor purchases that occur online, sales are aggregated for reporting purposes without regard to player demographics.\u201d\nStore concentration\nOne factor that experts say helps explain the economic and racial disparities driving lottery play is the overconcentration of lottery retailers in lower-income, nonwhite communities.\nThe convenience store where Standifer bought her scratch-off tickets is in a neighborhood that has a poverty rate almost three times the state average and a Black population 25 percentage points higher than the state average. There are four lottery retailers in this largely residential neighborhood, and another 28 in bordering neighborhoods.\nIn Michigan, neighborhoods with a lottery retailer have a median poverty rate that is nearly double the rate in neighborhoods without lottery retailers and a median household income that is $16,000 lower, the Howard Center analysis found.\nIn fact, the Howard Center found that stores in the vast majority of states that sell lottery tickets are disproportionately concentrated in communities with lower levels of education, lower levels of income and higher poverty rates, with larger populations of Black people and Hispanic people.\nOnly Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Utah and Nevada lack lotteries. The Howard Center was unable to obtain lottery retailer locations in South Dakota, but did obtain them for the other 44 states, plus Washington, D.C., that have lotteries.\nThe analysis found:\n\nIn neighborhoods with lottery retailers, the percentage of the population that lives in poverty is higher than in neighborhoods without lottery retailers in all 44 states analyzed and in Washington, D.C.\nThe median household income in neighborhoods with lottery retailers is lower than in neighborhoods without lottery retailers in 41 states and Washington, D.C. The only exceptions were Arkansas, Kentucky and Vermont.\nThe Black population was higher in neighborhoods with lottery retailers than in neighborhoods without lottery retailers in 35 states and Washington, D.C.\nThe Hispanic population was higher in neighborhoods with lottery retailers than in neighborhoods without them in 37 states and Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no debate that lotteries prey on poor folks,\u201d Bernal said. \u201cYou have half the country that doesn\u2019t have any assets whatsoever. They don\u2019t have an emergency fund. They don\u2019t have any investments. They don\u2019t own property. Literally every street corner they are selling $30 scratch tickets.\u201d\nThe North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, a lottery industry group, maintains that it\u2019s misleading to examine where stores are concentrated, because people \u201cdon\u2019t always buy their lottery tickets in the neighborhoods where they live. They purchase them on their way to or from work, while shopping or running other errands, or even at the airport.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unquestionably true that people \u201cdon\u2019t always\u201d buy tickets where they live. But the Howard Center\u2019s first-of-its-kind analysis of mobile-phone location data shows that lottery retail customers are mostly local.\nThe Howard Center used mobile location data from SafeGraph, a location intelligence firm that collects information about foot traffic at more than 6 million U.S. stores. For each store, the aggregated SafeGraph data reveals the neighborhoods where a store\u2019s customers live.\nConsider a Marathon gas station in Warren, Michigan, a five-minute drive from the Korner Party Store where Standifer played. With more than $725,000 in sales, the Marathon station was in the top 20% of Michigan lottery retailers in 2020.\nMore than two-thirds of its customers live in the same neighborhood as the gas station or in neighborhoods immediately around it, with the average customer living within 1.1 miles of the store.\nThe analysis, which examined store traffic patterns at nearly three-quarters of all U.S. lottery retailers, found similar patterns across the country. The Howard Center found that in all but Arizona and Washington, D.C., a majority of lottery retailers had a customer base that mainly came from local neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nThe Marathon gas station\u2019s visitors came from neighborhoods that had, on average, a household income $16,000 less than Michigan\u2019s median of $57,000. In 29 of 44 states it analyzed and in Washington, D.C., the Howard Center found a similar divide, where the average household income of neighborhoods that visited lottery retailers was lower than the state\u2019s overall average income.\nState lotteries actively recruit lottery retailers to sell tickets. In Florida, a 2010 legislative report found that increasing the number of retail outlets was \u201ccritical\u201d to increasing sales.\n\u201cBecome a Delaware Lottery Retailer \u2026 See how much you could earn,\u201d the Delaware Lottery says on its website. \u201cYou\u2019ll build a base of regular players, who ring up extra sales in addition to their steady ticket purchases,\u201d it adds.\nA Howard Center review of recruitment materials and policies governing what kinds of stores can sell tickets found that states are mostly concerned about store security, the ability to hit sales targets and compliance with in-store advertising requirements with in-store advertising requirements when deciding whether to permit a store to sell tickets.\nThe review found no evidence that states consider racial or economic inequity when considering permitting new stores in an area.\nWho benefits from the system\nPlayers like Standifer fund the system by losing a total of $29 billion annually.\nBut there are consistent winners: the multinational companies that run the lotteries on behalf of the states, the stores that sell tickets \u2014 including large convenience-store chains, such as 7-Eleven and Circle K \u2014 advertising and media companies, and state administrators who oversee the process.\nOf that $29 billion, those entities will keep more than a quarter: $8 billion.\nPrivate businesses took in about $1.9 billion running U.S. lotteries in the 2020 fiscal year, according to a Howard Center analysis of state financial disclosures.\nThe lottery operations industry is dominated by two private companies, U.K.-based International Game Technology PLC and Canadian-owned Scientific Games Holdings LP.\nBetween the two companies, IGT and Scientific Games have a hand in running lotteries in all but two states, Vermont and Wyoming. Operating under long-term contracts that are regularly renewed, these companies print scratch-off tickets, run computer systems that power the lottery and, in some states, handle marketing and advertising.\nState-level lobbying by Scientific Games in the 1980s was critical to the expansion of the lottery from one state, New Hampshire in 1964, to nearly every state today. They now run lottery systems or print instant tickets in 37 of 45 states and in Washington, D.C. \u2014 including Michigan, where Standifer lives \u2014 and brought in revenues of $918 million in 2020.\n\u201cWhile Scientific Games was not responsible for the creation of any new lotteries after 1984,\u201d historian Jonathan D. Cohen writes, \u201cits campaigns set the stage for the massive spread of legalized gambling across the Midwest, West, and Upper South in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\u201d\nCompanies like Scientific Games that service state-backed lotteries already have a heavy hand in how the games are operated. Barriers to entry for new companies are high since states are reluctant to switch from established players such as Scientific Games, said Charles Clotfelter, a Duke University professor of economics and law and of public policy who has written about lottery companies.\nIn the years ahead, their control over lotteries is expected to expand significantly as more state officials take a step back. Illinois, Indiana and New Jersey already have essentially privatized their lotteries.\nThis increased privatization comes as Scientific Games just sold its lottery business to Toronto-based private equity firm Brookfield Business Partners LP for nearly $6 billion. Future profits will benefit Brookfield CEO Bruce Flatt, who is worth $4.5 billion and is the world\u2019s 622nd-richest person, according to Forbes as of May 2022.\nThe sale also means the largest firms running state lotteries are all controlled by non-U.S. companies.\nRetailers win, too\nAnother $5 billion, funded by Standifer and other players, will go to retail stores that get a commission for selling tickets and cashing in winning tickets. They earn, on average, 6%, but also earn substantial bonuses when a customer wins a huge prize.\nConvenience stores \u2014 including convenience stores located at gas stations \u2014 account for nearly two-thirds of all lottery sales. While the profit margin on lottery ticket sales lags well behind cigarettes, alcohol and food, lottery tickets are an important tool in drawing customers into the store.\nPeople who buy lottery tickets at convenience stores spend nearly twice as much, on average, as other convenience store customers, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores.\nAbout 60% of all convenience stores are owned by people who own one store, and many are not chain stores. But there are major multinational firms that profit from thousands of U.S. stores. That includes the Japanese firm Seven & i Holdings Co. Ltd., which has more than 13,000 stores under the 7-Eleven and Speedway brands.\nMany states permit sales at stores that specifically market to low-income clientele. Texas recently permitted sales at Dollar General, a discount chain. And check-cashing stores, which are patronized by lower-income people who don\u2019t have bank accounts, sell lottery tickets in 24 states, the Howard Center found.\nAt All Checks Cashed in Everett, Massachusetts, red signs beckon customers to cash their checks, pay utilities and try their luck with lottery tickets.\nAll Checks Cashed in Everett, Massachusetts, is one of nearly 150 businesses licensed by the state of Massachusetts to cash checks and sell lottery tickets. Check cashers sold nearly $36 million in lottery products from 2017 through 2020.(Garrett Adamtsev/Boston University)\nGlittering multicolored scratch-off tickets on a wall behind the cashier\u2019s station tempt those willing to pay fees to quickly get cash and then try their hand at winning millions.\nAll Checks Cashed is one of nearly 150 retailers in Massachusetts currently licensed by the state Division of Banks to cash checks for a range of fees. Check cashers collectively sold nearly $36 million in lottery products across the state between 2017 and 2020, according to state records.\nHow governments spend their share\nAfter prizes are paid out and the costs of running the lottery are paid for, $21 billion of the original $82 billion remains for spending on government programs. These funds, according to states, justify the existence of the lottery.\nLotteries fund all sorts of programs in different states \u2014 economic development, pension systems, horse racing and tax relief.\nVery little goes to combat problem gambling. The funding made available \u2014 $14.7 million across 10 states \u2014 means just $7 of every $10,000 made by the state lottery system goes toward helping chronic gamblers.\nThe majority of lottery money retained by the government is specifically earmarked for education programs, in a manner that often compounds inequities generated by the use of lottery funds.\nNationally, at least two-thirds of lottery proceeds go to fund education programs. Much of that money goes to finance the K-12 school system or higher-education scholarships.\nThe Michigan lottery has for decades billed itself as a win for education. The vast majority of the state\u2019s share of lottery funding is used for K-12 education funding. \u201cFor fun. For schools. For 50 years,\u201d the state\u2019s lottery website reads.\nHowever, studies show the state\u2019s education funding formula is inequitable. Michigan received a grade of \u201cD\u201d for how it funds low-poverty districts, compared to districts with high poverty rates, according to a 2021 report from the Education Law Center.\nThe disparity is caused by a funding formula that gives inadequate weight to the higher cost of educating low-income and at-risk students, according to Zahava Stadler, a school funding researcher with The Education Trust.\nThe Korner Party Store, where Standifer played in April, is located in Michigan\u2019s Van Dyke school district. More than two-thirds of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, and 62% of the district\u2019s students are Black. WalletHub ranks Van Dyke 364th out of Michigan\u2019s 535 districts in funding equity: the per-pupil funding for the district is $12,746, and the average household income is $36,099. The state provides $8,700 of that funding to Van Dyke, the minimum level of per-pupil funding in the state.\n\u201cBasically, the state is providing pennies on the dollar as additional support for low-income students,\u201d Stadler said. \u201cWhy does Michigan ultimately do such a poor job of providing increased funding for low-income students? The answer is the formula is not structured to try very hard.\u201d\nStudies have found similar K-12 funding inequities in many other states where the lottery funds education.\nA 2021 report from the Education Law Center classified 18 states\u2019 funding-distribution systems as progressive \u2014 that is, a system where the state allocates more per-pupil funds to high-poverty districts than to low-poverty districts. At the other end of the spectrum, the report says 15 states have a regressive system: high-poverty districts receive as much as a third less per student than their low-poverty counterparts.\nA third of the states in the study that have a regressive funding system \u2014 Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire and Texas \u2014 operate a lottery system and use at least a portion of funds to finance their K-12 education programs.\nCalifornia, in contrast, is given credit for trying to correct these inequities through school funding, with the Education Law Center giving the state a \u201cB\u201d grade for its progressive funding formula. Still, critics question whether lottery systems are the right way to raise government funds, even if they are being used to try to correct existing inequities.\n\u201cLotteries are a bad way of raising school funding. Lotteries are a bad way of raising public funding, period,\u201d Stadler said. \u201cGenerally speaking, lotteries pull a lot of money out of the communities that actually need it the most.\u201d\nSome states earmark lottery revenue to pay for broad-access college scholarship funds.\nIn Kentucky, lottery funds are used primarily for higher-education scholarships, with nearly half going to a largely merit-based program, the Kentucky Educational Excellence Scholarship (KEES), which awards money for college on a sliding scale based on a high school student\u2019s GPA and test scores.\nNearly 10% of Kentucky high school students are Black, but they got less than 5% of KEES scholarship funding, an analysis of 2020 state scholarship data shows. That\u2019s partly because a smaller percentage of Black students who were awarded KEES scholarships chose to enroll in college than white students and because the average white KEES college student got $1,745, compared with $1,244 for the average Black KEES college student.\nAwards from the state\u2019s two need-based college grants, which account for half of lottery proceeds, better reflected Kentucky\u2019s Black student population. Black students received about 11% of need-based funds in 2020.\nHunter Dixon, an 18-year-old freshman mechanical engineering student sitting in a food court at the University of Louisville, said Kentucky\u2019s lottery system, which funds the merit-based scholarship he receives, was \u201cessentially wealth redistribution.\u201d\n\u201cBut instead of the way that we could make it more equitable, it makes it less,\u201d Dixon said.\nUniversity of Louisville senior Abby Donahue, 21, said gambling is a \u201csystem designed to make you lose.\u201d\nBut, she added, college is so expensive, and students are so desperate for scholarships, that they do not think twice about where the money comes from or how it is being raised.\nMeanwhile, Standifer and millions of others like her continue to play.\nHoward Center reporters Brandie Bland, Jillian Diamond, Vanessa G. Sanchez and Lauren Mowry contributed to this story. Melissa Ellin, Isabel Tehan and Ethan Biddle of Boston University also contributed."},

Speaking in Spanish, he said he often buys the $50 tickets and has lost enough to come up short on rent and food \u201cmany times.\u201d\nYet he keeps coming back.\n\u201cI feel that in the next ticket I can become a millionaire,\u201d he said.\nState lotteries spend more than a half-billion dollars a year on pervasive marketing campaigns that deliver a similarly hopeful message, designed to persuade people to play often, spend more and overlook the long odds of winning.\nA Texas Lottery internet ad tells players they can \u201cunleash the power of luck\u201d by purchasing $20 scratch tickets. A sign outside a supermarket in New Jersey beckons passersby to \u201cGive Your Dreams A Chance.\u201d\nA YouTube video reminds Virginia players they can win more if they wager more. A phone app in Michigan sends alerts \u201creminding you to purchase tickets before the draw.\u201d\nThe investment has paid off for the lotteries. For every $1 spent on advertising nationwide, they have made about $128 in ticket sales, according to an analysis of lottery data by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland.\nBut behind that success are millions of people like Constancia. For every dollar players spend on the lottery, they will lose about 35 cents on average, the data shows. For many, the losses add up to thousands, even tens of thousands, of dollars over time.\nThat\u2019s not a statistic the lotteries advertise, and they don\u2019t have to. As state agencies, they are exempt from Federal Trade Commission regulations that prohibit misleading and deceptive advertising.\n\u201cThe FTC does not regulate state lotteries because they are regulated at the state level, but the most important part is that we do not regulate them because they are not interstate commerce,\u201d a commission spokesperson said.\nThat leaves oversight of advertising up to the state legislatures that depend on lottery revenue to help balance their budgets.\nThe conflict of interest has hindered efforts to rein in advertising, such as a 2020 bill that a South Dakota legislator introduced to ban lotteries from promoting their games over concerns they were addictive. It failed to get out of committee after a state official testified it would reduce the flow of lottery money for education spending by $1 million.\n\u201cIt troubles me how the state promotes gambling while at the same time running ads warning people about opioids, meth, tobacco and every other addictive habit people may be susceptible to,\u201d state Rep. John Mills, a Republican who sponsored the bill, wrote in an email. \u201cThe double standard is obvious and hypocritical, motivated purely by money.\u201d\nGovernment reliance on gambling funds also puts pressure on lotteries to pursue \u201cnew marketing, glossier colors on the scratch tickets, whatever it may be to get people to keep coming, because otherwise the numbers go down,\u201d said Les Bernal, national director of Stop Predatory Gambling, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Washington, D.C.\nThe impact of the aggressive marketing is especially profound on lower-income Black and Hispanic populations. Studies have found they spend more on lottery games than other groups.\nThey also are more likely to encounter a retailer with advertisements in the window inviting them to come in and take a chance.\nThe Howard Center found that stores in the vast majority of the states that sell lottery tickets \u2013 45 states, plus Washington, D.C., have lotteries \u2013 are disproportionately concentrated in communities with lower levels of education and income and higher poverty rates, with larger populations of Black and Hispanic people.\n\u201cThey prey on people\u2019s hopes because there are a lot of people in this country that are hurting,\u201d said David Surdam, professor of economics at the University of Northern Iowa, who authored a book chapter critical of lottery marketing. \u201cThey figure their chances of ever having real prosperity are pretty slender and the lottery may be the only hope they have.\u201d\nSigns like the one posted above the front counter of a SHOP N Go convenience store in southwest Houston, Texas on May 7, 2022, attract players to buy lottery scratch-off tickets every day. State lotteries spend more than a half-billion dollars a year on messaging like this in pervasive marketing campaigns designed to persuade people to play often, spend more and overlook the long odds of winning. (Hannah Savage/Howard Center for Investigative Journalism)\nLottery agencies can point to \u201cplay responsibly\u201d messages and winning odds disclosures in their ads and on their websites.\nBut most of the participants in a 2021 study at the University of Memphis had trouble finding or remembering the odds-of-winning statements on scratch-off tickets and only 20% interpreted them correctly.\nJames P. Whelan, who co-authored the study, is co-director of the university\u2019s Institute for Gambling Education and Research.\n\u201cLottery corporations/governments believe they are engaged in responsible gambling and providing harm reducing messages. In reality, they are not,\u201d Whelan wrote in an email.\nAnother 2021 study, by researchers from the Center for Gambling Studies at Rutgers University, found that most lottery websites admonished players to gamble responsibly but information on what that means was \u201cinconsistent and sparse.\u201d\nThe Howard Center also analyzed annual reports, advertising campaigns and state lottery marketing plans obtained through public records requests, and found they frequently promote the risky behavior that their responsible gambling messages discourage.\nIn the most recent annual report available on its website, the Connecticut Lottery touted its ad campaign urging players to use their common sense.\nOne of the campaign ads, \u201cMyths,\u201d shows someone circling the 15 on a calendar with \u201cbirthday\u201d inscribed below it and then filling in 15 on a lottery ticket. A ball with the number 39 drops in the next frame, followed by a written message: \u201cUsing special numbers doesn\u2019t change your odds. Avoid common gambling myths.\u201d The eight-second spot had fewer than 100 views as of early May.\nThe video appears on the Connecticut Lottery\u2019s YouTube channel along with \u201cIndelible Numbers,\u201d a 30-second video that sends the opposite message. That ad follows a couple from their meeting, marriage, first home and their child\u2019s birth. Through the commercial, numbers are pulled from those meaningful events to form a group of five numbers they use to fill out a Cash 5 lottery slip.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not just any numbers, they\u2019re your numbers. Play them today, and every day,\u201d the narrator says.\nThat video had more than 3,700 views.\nA tiny \u201cPlay responsibly\u201d link at the bottom of the Virginia Lottery website leads to this statement: \u201cAt the Virginia Lottery, we encourage friendly competition and responsible play. We are committed to presenting all Virginia Lottery products in the most responsible and ethical manner.\u201d\nBut a Virginia Lottery ad on its YouTube channel encourages players to play Cash Pop, \u201can exciting new game,\u201d five times a day with separate drawings at \u201ccoffee break,\u201d \u201clunch break,\u201d \u201crush hour,\u201d \u201cprime time\u201d and \u201cafter hours.\u201d\nThe Virginia Lottery uses its YouTube channel to encourage players to play its \u201cCash Pop\u2019\u2019 game five times a day. As this screen shot shows, the lottery touts gambling at \u201ccoffee break,\u2019\u2019 \u201clunch break,\u2019\u2019 \u201crush hour,\u2019\u2019 \u201cprime time\u2019\u2019 and \u201cafter hours.\u2019\u2019Source: Virginia Lottery YouTube channel\nWhile you could play for as little as $1 on a single number, you are reminded that the \u201cmore you wager, the larger the cash prize you can win.\u201d The video goes on to show how players can bet up to $10 per number and up to 15 numbers per drawing \u2014\u2013 and highlights a convenient box for selecting all the numbers in one stroke.\nThe ad fails to mention the cost of following those suggestions would add up to $750 a day. The odds of winning the $2,500 top prize, \u201c1 in 15,000,\u201d appear briefly in small type on the last frame.\nLottery advertising plans also show that online lotteries are giving state lotteries the ability to track players and target them more directly.\nThe 2019 Michigan Lottery marketing plan details how use of device-level data allowed tailoring of push notifications to \u201cincrease engagement and improve player retention with a seamless experience by delivering the right message, at the right time on the right platform.\u201d\n\u201cWhether it be app download, app open, message open, location update, shopping cart abandonment, or app uninstall, having the ability to respond to player behavior at this level will ensure better acquisition and retention,\u201d the plan says.\nThe marketing plan includes development of a ChatBot that reaches customers through artificial intelligence-based conversations as \u201ca pivotal next step to increase player engagement.\u201d\nOfficials at the Michigan, Virginia, Connecticut, New Jersey and Texas lotteries contacted for this story did not respond or declined to discuss their marketing campaigns. David Gale, executive director of the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, referred questions about industry practices to the state lottery agencies.\nOpponents of the Texas lottery have long raised concerns about the impact advertising can have on economically disadvantaged residents.\nThey won a provision in the 199 law that created the Texas Lottery, banning advertisements or promotions \u201cof a nature that unduly influences any person to purchase a lottery ticket.\u201d\nBut efforts to enforce that provision have faltered. A bill to prohibit the lottery from advertising in counties with a per-capita income below 150% of the poverty line and another to ensure advertising didn\u2019t target any specific demographic both failed.\nThe Howard Center\u2019s analysis, based on 2020 data, found that census tracts in Texas with lottery retailers, like the one where Constancia buys his tickets, had larger Hispanic populations and higher poverty levels. And the lottery\u2019s own 2020 study found Hispanic players outspent players belonging to any other demographic group on lottery games by 30%.\nThe Texas Lottery Commission, the agency that oversees the lottery, has adopted some safeguards. Its advertising \u201csensitivity\u201d policies require marketing agencies to design campaigns that do not \u201cexploit a person, specific group or economic class.\u201d\nYet the commision has made its scratch-off Texas Loteria games the centerpiece of a four-year, $3 million marketing campaign to boost its brand and sales with a special emphasis on \u201cethnic markets,\u201d according to documents obtained through a records request.\nThe lottery originally introduced them as $3, $5 and $10 scratch offs. But beginning in 2018, it added two $20 Loteria games and most recently, a $50 version \u2014 one of the most expensive games in the Texas market today.\nLatinWorks Marketing LLC, a firm specializing in ad campaigns that tap into the growing Hispanic market, won the contract to promote sales. The company, now called Third Ear, proposed hiring a Hispanic and a non-Hispanic influencer to get around ad blockers and reach both groups.\nIn year one of the campaign, sales of Million Dollar Loteria, Mega Loteria and Super Loteria scratch-off tickets topped $540 million, contributing to a record $4.85 billion in scratch-off ticket sales, according to a 2021 Texas Lottery report.\nIn an email, a spokesperson said the \u201cTexas Lottery declines to participate in this project, either by conducting an interview or answering written questions.\u201d\nThird Ear declined to discuss the advertising proposal designed for the Texas Lottery Commission.\n\u201cPer the agreements we have in place across all partners of the agency, we don\u2019t discuss client business with third parties,\u201d company Vice President Jaime Gonz\u00e1lez-Mir wrote in an email.\nVanessa S\u00e1nchez Pulla reported from Texas and Virginia.

Koza described a \u201cdraft version of our new model state lottery law which we distribute widely each year to state legislators and government officials in non-lottery states.\u201d\n\u201cWe are seriously considering the possibility of supporting an initiative petition effort in Oklahoma and/or Arkansas to establish a state-operated lottery there in the November 1986 elections,\u201d Koza wrote in a letter to Gaming Business Magazine.\nHistorian Jonathan D. Cohen found that Scientific Games\u2019 political activities were key to the creation of state lotteries, primarily in the early 1980s, via ballot initiatives in Arizona, Washington, D.C., Colorado, Oregon, and finally the \u201cbonanza\u201d in California. The California lottery \u201cwas entirely the product of Scientific Games,\u201d said I. Nelson Rose, a law professor, author of \u201cGambling and the Law\u201d and a widely cited expert in the field of gambling law.\nA cover letter from a packet John R. Koza, who was co-founder and chairman of what was then Scientific Games Corp., sent to an acquaintance asking him to review a proposed bill for the Oklahoma lottery in 1986. Jon Cohen, author of \u201cFor a Dollar and a Dream: State Lotteries in Modern America,\u201d says this bill was used and reused almost verbatim across multiple states. (Courtesy of University of Nevada, Las Vegas)\nAlmost 60 years after New Hampshire started its lottery in 1964, 44 more states plus Washington, D.C., have established lotteries. Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah remain the only states without lotteries.\nOklahoma enacted a lottery in 2004, after Scientific Games proposed draft legislation in 1986 and contributed money to a pro-lottery effort in that state. In the end, Scientific Games was named primary contractor.\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a grassroots movement for this,\u201d said Les Bernal, national director of Stop Predatory Gambling, of lottery expansion. \u201cIt\u2019s being driven by a handful of cynical public officials from both political parties [in conjunction with] powerful gambling interest groups that stand to benefit.\u201d\nToday, 45 states and Washington, D.C., have lotteries, as do dozens of countries across the globe. \u201cWhile Scientific Games was not responsible for the creation of any new lotteries after 1984,\u201d Cohen wrote, \u201cits campaigns set the stage for the massive spread of legalized gambling across the Midwest, West, and Upper South in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\u201d\nWhen were lotteries created in each state?\nForty-five states, plus the District of Columbia, has lotteries. La Fleur\u2019s 2021 World Lottery Almanac shows the years each state adopted its lottery. (Jenna Cohen/Howard Center for Investigative Journalism)\nScientific Games spokesperson Therese Minella declined to answer questions and instead directed a reporter to the company\u2019s website. Minella wrote that a Howard Center for Investigative Journalism question about the company\u2019s lobbying and influence \u201cis inaccurate as a premise,\u201d and didn\u2019t respond to emails or a telephone message seeking elaboration.\nScientific Games\u2019 lottery business was purchased for $6 billion in April by Brookfield Business Partners LP, a private equity firm based in Canada. The remaining part of Scientific Games was renamed Light & Wonder Inc. and retained Las Vegas as its headquarters.\nAdam McLaren, a vice president and senior analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service Inc. who follows the lottery business, doesn\u2019t necessarily see Scientific Games as the main driver of lottery expansion. Instead, it was states \u2013 looking for new revenue \u2013 which joined the lottery bandwagon after other states established them.\n\u201cScientific Games played a big part in the start, but it\u2019s hard to say they were the ones who spread the growth,\u201d McLaren said. \u201cOnce one state saw it, and saw there is a social aspect and they saw that it could be done in a safe way, then they wanted it in their state. It doesn\u2019t have as harsh of a stigma as casino gambling.\u201d\nAccording to interviews and court documents, the Scientific Games strategy to win public acceptance of lotteries has proven so effective that state governments have since become their biggest cheerleaders. The Howard Center found that state lotteries drive a multibillion-dollar wealth transfer to lottery contractors from players concentrated in low-income, high-poverty communities with lower levels of education and larger Black and Hispanic populations.\nSome states go to unusual lengths to protect their lotteries. The Wyoming Lottery Corporation, for example, filed a lawsuit against a prominent critic after he wrote to national lottery organizations with complaints about the company\u2019s handling of compulsive gambling. Edward Atchison, the former director of the Wyoming Council on Problem Gambling, accused the Wyoming Lottery of preying on people with compulsive gambling addictions.\nAtchison\u2019s lawyer, Tim Kingston, said it \u201camazed\u201d him that a quasi-governmental entity like the lottery would pursue legal action against a private citizen. \u201cHe\u2019s a citizen and has the right to speak out about a public issue,\u201d Kingston said. \u201cThey\u2019re just trying to shut him up.\u201d\nAtchison died in May 2016, before the case could proceed, and it ultimately was dismissed.\nThe Scientific Games playbook\nState lotteries\u2019 origin stories follow a general pattern: a shortfall of state tax revenues and a growing need to build schools, fix potholes and pay for other government services drives officials to look for new revenue sources.\nTake, for example, the budget squeeze in California. The state kicked off what would become known as the \u201cTax Revolt\u201d in 1978 with the passage of Proposition 13, a ballot initiative that drastically reduced property taxes. California voters approved a lottery by ballot initiative in 1984.\nAs states began considering new sources of revenue such as lotteries, they needed private contractors to handle the ticket printing, game design, database management and other operations. Scientific Games saw a great opportunity.\nLobbyists at the behest of Scientific Games formed groups with names like Arizonans for Tax Reduction or Californians for Better Education. In what was among the first examples of \u201castroturfing\u201d in the American political system, Scientific Games executives employed these firms to disguise their interests as genuine grassroots activism, Cohen and Bernal said.\nAstroturfing, in this case, included \u201cpaying signature gatherers and writing legislation, and then forming citizens coalitions that were just total fronts for the company and its advertising efforts,\u201d Cohen said in an interview.\nThe pro-lottery forces made sure to specify how lottery proceeds would be used for schools or other popular services rather than having funds mixed with the \u201cblack hole\u201d of state general funds when knocking on doors for petition signatures, Cohen described in his book, \u201cFor a Dollar and a Dream: State Lotteries in Modern America.\u201d An Arizona poll showed \u201cthe use of lottery revenue for a specific purpose held a 10 percent advantage over allocation to the general fund,\u201d Cohen wrote.\nScientific Games\u2019 efforts did not stop with signature gathering: The company wrote some of the bills that would ultimately be ratified. Cohen compared lottery language in ballot initiatives in California and Oregon to the generic version Koza shared. The state versions were so similar that Cohen called significant parts of them \u201cword for word.\u201d\nScientific Games\u2019 efforts to bring a lottery to Oklahoma surfaced in 1986, when the company contributed $25,000 to pro-lottery organizations when legislation to enact a lottery was being debated in the Oklahoma House of Representatives, according to an article in The Oklahoman from that year. Ultimately, the lottery bill incubated for almost 20 years before 64% of voters approved it through referendum in 2005.\nThe initiatives, once passed, were essentially tailored so that only Scientific Games could serve as the instant ticket vendor, according to Rose and Cohen. Language in the California initiative required detailed financial disclosures from all of the executives, Rose said, knowing \u201ctheir competitors at the time weren\u2019t going to reveal all this confidential financial information about their executives.\u201d\nContractors in California and Oregon were also required to be selling tickets within 135 days, a requirement that all but mandated lotteries offer scratch tickets off the bat, effectively making Scientific Games the sole competitor, Cohen said.\nScientific Games largely exited the political arena of lottery legislation after all five of its pet-project ballot initiatives passed, Cohen said, but it remained on the scene with a reduced footprint.\nScientific Games, by its own admission, had a forceful expansion strategy in the 1980s. Then-President and CEO William G. Malloy described in a 1993 interview the company\u2019s shift in business strategy from the prior decade. \u201cWe aim for a constructive aggressiveness, but not aggressiveness in terms of what we saw in the early days of Scientific Games,\u201d Malloy told Gaming and Wagering Business magazine. \u201cWe recognize that lottery executives are pretty knowledgeable these days and wouldn\u2019t go along with it.\u201d\nA 1983 internal company study offered a sense of Scientific Games\u2019 expansionary ambitions in that era. The company conducted extensive market research to argue that lotteries would not eat into the betting at horse races, known as parimutuel wagering.\nKoza, then head of Scientific Games, said the potential market of lottery players was bigger than the typical blue-collar and male patrons at horse tracks. In defining these audiences, Scientific Games pointed out the consumers they subsequently targeted amid their plan to expand. \u201cAll available evidence indicates that the lottery player and the parimutuel wagerer are different, that the introduction of a lottery does not negatively impact parimutuel revenues\u201d and can, by contrast, \u201chelp the parimutuel industry,\u201d the study said.\nScientific Games\u2019 expansion and success drew criticism, even from officials in states where they were operating. California Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig said \u201deducation was used to get the lottery passed, but education hasn\u2019t benefited from it.\u201d Arizona state Sen. Ray Rottas, a Phoenix Republican, lamented that he had \u201cmisgivings about them receiving the contract because this is the first time in the state of Arizona that an initiative has been bought and paid for.\u201d\nLegacy of Scientific Games\u2019 strategy\nThe broad contours of Scientific Games\u2019 lobbying innovations are evident in states that most recently implemented lotteries. Mississippi, which established its lottery in 2018, saw employees of its public programs vying for a share of lottery proceeds before a bill was even filed in the legislature.\n\u201cRoad builders [were] asking \u2026 for the lottery proceeds to go to the roads,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Nick Bain. \u201cEducators or teacher unions \u2026 came in saying we need education.\u201d\nIn Wyoming, the pro-lottery sales pitch focused on residents traveling out of state to buy lottery tickets. Lottery supporters such as David Zwonitzer, a former Wyoming state representative and sponsor of the state\u2019s lottery bill, argued this out-of-state spending should instead help benefit local retailers and the Wyoming state government.\nA similar argument was made in Mississippi. \u201cStates were generating money from Mississippi residents [that were] using the lottery in their state, and Mississippi was not getting the revenue for that,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Tommy Reynolds.\nThe lottery messaging is now crafted by the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, a trade association of lottery professionals in the U.S. and Canada. It does not directly lobby, but Bernal said the organization\u2019s true purpose is to \u201cmake the lotteries seem like they\u2019re any other business.\u201d He added the group\u2019s industry best practices effectively show \u201chow to get people to lose more money more efficiently [to] state government.\u201d Phone messages to the group were not returned.\nState governments, armed with the association\u2019s messaging, have moved on from their late-1980s reservations to become the lottery\u2019s biggest advocates in recent years. One vivid example of this advocacy involved a 2019 lawsuit by the New Hampshire Lottery Commission and other state lotteries against the Department of Justice. The state lotteries sought to preserve sales of lottery tickets online, which were threatened by a Justice Department legal ruling.\nIn January 2019, the Justice Department reinterpreted the 1961 Wire Act to apply to iLottery tickets, which would prohibit iLotteries nationwide. Bernal said there was an immediate \u201cuproar\u201d from the states.\n\u201cLotteries which are not making the games available on the internet within the next 10 years will lose an entire generation of players,\u201d Charles \u201cCharlie\u201d McIntyre, director of the New Hampshire Lottery and former association president, told Public Gaming magazine. In Michigan, for example, iLottery sales increased by almost 1,300% from 2015 to 2021 while traditional lottery sales continued to rise.\nThe New Hampshire Lottery Commission, joined by other states and lottery vendors, sued the Justice Department to preserve online lottery sales. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel argued in a court filing that the Justice Department ruling would put vital state-level public services at risk of shrinking or disappearing.\nUltimately, a federal appeals court sided with the states, preserving this new online lottery venture. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu celebrated a victory that would \u201cprotect public education in our state.\u201d\nDespite states\u2019 support for lotteries, the industry still faces a stigma and challenges to expand in some areas. In early 2022, a bill to legalize the sale of scratch tickets in Wyoming to fund a recreation program failed. State Rep. Jeremy Haroldson, a Republican who voted against the bill, said the gaming industry\u2019s influence in Wyoming is growing.\nConsolidation of lottery managers\nThere are four multinational companies based outside of the U.S. that dominate service of state-backed lotteries: Scientific Games, Pollard Banknote Ltd., International Game Technology PLC and Intralot SA. They provide software, computer systems and scratch-off ticket printing, and allow operation of multistate lottery games such as Powerball.\nPrivate companies play a major role in servicing lotteries and say they view this as a way to help local governments solve their budget problems. \u201cWith increasing budget deficits, we expect governments to rely even more on the proceeds generated from lottery programs as a funding alternative,\u201d said Brookfield Business Partners LP CEO \u200b\u200bCyrus Madon.\nCharles Clotfelter, professor of public policy and of economics and law at Duke University who has written about lottery companies, said states are heavily dependent on these few tried-and-true vendors and are reluctant to try new companies. \u201cStates don\u2019t want to get in a situation where they go to a new vendor and then something blows up,\u201d Clotfelter said. \u201cStates tend to use the same vendors.\u201d\nPrivate businesses took in about $1.9 billion running U.S. lotteries in the 2020 fiscal year, according to a Howard Center analysis of state financial disclosures. More than half of all the states with lotteries saw an increase in contractor costs through the pandemic, demonstrating the expansion of vendor involvement. Scientific Games\u2019 lottery revenues grew during the COVID-19 pandemic to $918 million in 2020 from $911 million in 2019.\nJillian Diamond, Jamie Pinzon, Spencer Friedman and Professors Rob Wells and Constance Mitchell Ford of the University of Maryland contributed to this report."},

These companies will provide comprehensive services including software, game operations, and retail terminal management, while states assume a more oversight-focused role.", "content": "The companies that run state-backed lotteries already have a heavy hand in how the games are operated. But in the years ahead, their control over lotteries is expected to expand significantly while state officials take a step back.\nAnalysts who track the industry say the largest companies are trying to forge what one calls \u201cenhanced partnerships\u201d with the states, and what others refer to as \u201cprivatization\u201d programs that will transfer most of the day-to-day management and strategic decision-making from states to private companies.\nThe lottery industry in the U.S. is dominated by two giants, International Game Technology PLC and Scientific Games Holdings LP, and a handful of smaller companies including Intralot SA and Pollard Banknote Ltd. These companies are likely to continue to dominate this market, which boasted $82 billion in ticket sales in the 2020 fiscal year, because states are reluctant to risk hiring an upstart to run such a high-profile business.\nLottery systems nationwide are evolving into quasi-privatized operations, with state governments assuming an oversight role while private companies reap millions running this sophisticated form of gambling.\nThese companies provide the software and computer systems that help run games such as Pick 4 in Kentucky and Maryland, Cash Pop in Florida and Lotto in Colorado. Some of the companies also print instant scratch-off tickets, process winning tickets and manufacture terminals \u2014 including video lottery terminals \u2014 used at retail locations.\nWhile these companies play a vital role in all of the 45 states that operate lotteries, plus Washington, D.C., the industry is transitioning, according to analysts, in a way that will give them nearly total control as private managers of state lotteries.\n\u201cThe transition that is taking place will let the companies effectively provide more service and manage almost everything end to end,\u201d said Adam McLaren, a vice president and senior analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service in New York.\nAs lottery jackpots grow, involving multiple states, and as lotteries introduce new products such as sports betting apps, the technology needed to drive these changes and upgrades becomes more complex.\nMcLaren said states don\u2019t have the capital or expertise to manage these systems, monitor and secure user data, and process winning tickets, all while designing new games.\nSo far, only three states \u2014 Illinois, Indiana and New Jersey \u2014 have gone so far as to \u201cprivatize\u201d their lottery operations. Illinois was the first to do so in 2011 when it hired Northstar Lottery Group LLC, a consortium owned by International Game Technology and Scientific Games. Indiana picked a company a year later that in 2014 bought International Game Technology and assumed its name. New Jersey struck a deal in 2013 with Northstar.\nIn these transactions, the private manager generally takes over lottery sales, marketing and management functions in exchange for an upfront payment and a promise to generate a minimum net income for the state.\nThese arrangements aren\u2019t always smooth at the start. Illinois canceled its contract with Northstar after a few years because revenue came in lower than expected. It then hired Camelot Group, a company in England that operates the U.K. National Lottery.\nUnder New Jersey\u2019s 2013 agreement with Northstar, the state received $120 million upfront and a commitment from the company to generate at least $1.42 billion of additional net income for the state over the life of the contract. In a press release issued at the time, the state said the deal would bring in more revenue than it could have expected had lottery operations remained unchanged.\n\u201cBy combining the Lottery\u2019s and Northstar NJ\u2019s expertise and resources, we will be able to expand the Lottery\u2019s presence in the marketplace, offer exciting new games to our customers and new services to our retailers,\u201d said Carole Hedinger, who was executive director of the New Jersey Lottery at the time. But Northstar wasn\u2019t able to meet its targets and the deal was renegotiated in 2019.\nIn February, the Washington, D.C., lottery lost revenue and had its image tarnished when its sports betting app went offline during the Super Bowl, one of the biggest days of the year for sports betting. The DC Lottery blamed a software glitch at Intralot SA, which signed a five-year contract in 2019 to run sports wagers and other lottery services. In April, the DC Lottery said it received $500,000 in compensation from Intralot for the Super Bowl fiasco.\nEven before that, Intralot was having some management turmoil. Christos K. Dimitriadis, who became CEO in March 2020, stepped down eight months later. Dimitriadis was replaced by his predecessor, Sokratis Kokkalis, who founded the company in 1992. Intralot did not return calls seeking comment.\nNevertheless, Intralot has been able to celebrate some successes. In April, the company announced it signed a five-year extension of its contract with Wyoming\u2019s lottery.\nIs it really privatization?\nThere are limits to how much control states can pass along. Federal law generally prohibits private companies from operating lotteries, fearing their presence could lead to corruption.\nIn 2008, the Department of Justice issued an advisory noting that states can hire private companies to operate certain aspects of lotteries, but the advisory also said federal law requires that states maintain control over \u201call significant business decisions\u201d and that the private companies may not receive more than a \u201cde minimis\u201d interest in the profits.\nThe advisory means that states, not the private companies, must make major decisions, such as whether to join multistate games, allow online sales or create a sports betting app.\n\u201cWhat the \u2018de minimis share of profits/losses\u2019 phrase means is that DOJ effectively signaled that what would be disallowed would be a long-term lease where you\u2019d fully monetize the lottery for some long period,\u201d said Leonard Gilroy, vice president of government reform at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian organization that believes most business functions of government should be privatized.\nGilroy said the DOJ decision means lotteries can\u2019t be fully privatized. \u201cThat is not going to happen. Federal law won\u2019t allow it,\u201d he said, adding that what most people call privatization plans are actually public-private partnerships.\nWhether they are called privatization plans or partnerships, analysts agree that more will be crafted in the future.\nIn a recent report about Scientific Games, Zacks Investment Research Inc. in Chicago said the lottery industry\u2019s transition toward more private management has already begun and is \u201cevident from the increasing involvement of private vendors in state lottery management, higher prize payouts and introduction of tiered pricing for national jackpot games.\u201d\nDavid Gale, executive director of the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, said there is a practical reason why lottery companies will be playing a larger role. He said they are needed to print out the dizzying array of instant tickets, design and build new terminals, and create the systems to transition lotteries to the internet.\n\u201cStates can\u2019t do that on their own, they are not manufacturers,\u201d Gale said.\nThe association represents 53 lottery organizations.\nA recession-proof industry\nThe lottery business is one of the few sectors of the gaming industry that appears recession-proof.\nEarly in the pandemic, for example, casinos were hurt badly when they shut down as COVID-19 was spreading and stay-at-home ordinances were put in place.\nBut lottery operations weren\u2019t affected as much by the pandemic as gaming overall and revenues at some companies actually grew.\nDuring the first year of the pandemic in 2020, Scientific Games posted a total revenue of $2.7 billion, 20% less than the $3.4 billion reported in 2019, according to its 2020 annual report. But revenue from the company\u2019s gaming operations plummeted 47% to $926 million during that period. Meanwhile, revenue from the lottery business edged up slightly to $918 million in 2020 from $911 million in 2019.\nIGT\u2019s results were also buoyed by its lottery operations. IGT reported its 2020 revenue from gaming operations plummeted 45% from the previous year to $953 million while revenue from the lottery business declined just 5.6% to $2.2 billion. Both segments bounced back in 2021, with lottery revenue increasing 30% to $2.8 billion while IGT\u2019s nonlottery businesses grew 34% to $1.3 billion.\nIGT declined to comment, but in its 2021 annual report, the company said, \u201cThe global lottery industry has demonstrated remarkable resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue is expected to grow at mid-single digit rate from pre-pandemic levels.\u201d\nThe lottery business is not only recession-proof, but as jackpots grow large due in part to the multistate games, revenues for the companies are also expected to grow. In 2016, when the Powerball jackpot hit $1.6 billion, IGT\u2019s revenue hit $5 billion that year, a record high that it has not yet repeated. The company wouldn\u2019t confirm the impact of the Powerball jackpot on its growth.\nBut in its 2016 annual report, then-CEO Marco Sala wrote, \u201cIt was a very good year for IGT\u2019s global lottery operations, where revenues increased 7% in constant currency. This includes same store revenue growth of nearly 10% in North America.\u201d Sala also noted that IGT signed new lottery contracts that year in Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin, and extended key contracts in Georgia, Texas and Michigan.\nWhile the lottery is IGT\u2019s largest business segment and accounted for nearly 70% of its $4.1 billion in revenue in 2021, IGT is also a vendor to casinos and is best known for its most successful product: The \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d slot machine, one of the most popular slot machines in the world. It\u2019s also one of the longest running, having celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2021.\nConsolidation and lack of competition\nWhile lottery revenues are growing, the number of companies that provide lottery services has declined. That\u2019s partly due to a series of mergers and acquisitions over the past few decades that have consolidated the sector and centered the industry operations in Canada and Europe, even though the U.S. is the largest market for most companies.\nThe last remaining U.S.-based lottery giant, Scientific Games, sold its lottery business in April to Toronto-based private equity firm Brookfield Business Partners LP for nearly $6 billion. The remaining part of Scientific Games, mainly slot machines and online games or iGames, was renamed Light & Wonder Inc. and is based in Las Vegas. Brookfield retained the Scientific Games name and will operate the unit in suburban Atlanta.\nThe sale of Scientific Games was prompted in large part by the company\u2019s need to reduce its enormous debt load, which resulted from numerous past acquisitions, including the $5.1 billion purchase of slot machine maker Bally Technologies Inc. in 2014. The company \u201crealized that they needed to do something to de-lever,\u201d McLaren said.\nThe change in Scientific Games\u2019 direction also reflects the change in ownership. For years, the company was controlled by New York billionaire and investor Ron Perelman through his holding company, MacAndrews & Forbes Inc., which held a large stake in Scientific Games. Perelman sold his shares and stepped down as chairman in 2020, prompting the board to undertake an 18-month strategic review, leading to the sale.\nThat transaction leaves two Canadian firms, Brookfield and Pollard; two British companies, IGT and Camelot; and one Greek firm, Intralot, at the forefront of the industry.\n\u201cYears ago there were three times as many lottery companies. Through attrition, buyouts and mergers, the number of companies has been reduced,\u201d Gale said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any new companies.\u201d\nCharles Clotfelter, professor of public policy, and of economics and law at Duke University who has written about lottery companies, said states are reluctant to try new companies for fear that something could go wrong.\n\u201cStates don\u2019t want to get in a situation where they go to a new vendor and then something blows up,\u201d Clotfelter said. \u201cStates tend to use the same vendors.\u201d\nNot only do those practices make it difficult for new companies to break in, Clotfelter said, but it gives the largest companies more influence over how lotteries operate.\nIn the 1970s, \u201cwhen these lottery bills were passed, the halls were filled with lobbyists for companies. But not as much anymore,\u201d he said.\nThe newcomers\nAlthough the industry is dominated by IGT and Scientific Games, two smaller companies, Intralot and Pollard Banknote, are quickly developing pythonic power in the lottery industry.\nOf the newcomers, Pollard \u2014 best known for printing instant-win tickets \u2014\u2013 perhaps has had the oddest entree into the business. The company was founded in 1907 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, as a small family-owned commercial printing business, known then as Saults & Pollard.\nAs sales expanded, it ventured into security printing in the 1970s and eventually landed a contract with the Bank of Canada to print stamps, stocks, bonds and government documents. To commemorate its new business, the company\u2019s name was changed to Pollard Banknote. But the move proved futile as the Bank of Canada decided to eliminate paper $1 bills and replace them with the \u201cloonie\u201d coin.\nThe company then won the contract to print lotteries for the Canadian government. In a 2016 interview with Financial Post, Doug and John Pollard, brothers who are co-CEOs of the company, said the old name stuck. \u201c\u2018We\u2019ve been known as Pollard Banknote for 30-odd years, and we\u2019ve never printed a banknote in our lives.\u2019 And, John adds, \u2018have no plans to.\u2019\u201d\nProfessor Constance Mitchell Ford of the University of Maryland contributed to this report."},

Consumers have more power to control the marketplace now than ever before.\nThe most common source of news and entertainment in the late 20th century was satellite and digital cable television. However, smart phones, social media, and streaming services have changed the way people consume media all together. With cable not as necessary, many are choosing to \u201ccut the cord\u201d and move to streaming services for their content consumption. The subscription numbers support this trend as well.\n\nCNS performed a linear regression analysis of the total number of households paying for cable television in the United States. This equation uses data points that are already known to predict unknown variables. In this case, it is used to forecast future trends for cable subscribers.\n\nIn 2013, there were over 100 million households paying for cable. It can be forecasted that by 2026 there will be less than 60 million.\u00a0\nOne of the remaining draws of cable is the broadcasting of live events, including local news and sporting events, though this may not be enough to draw young adult consumers. According to a recent study from Horowitz Research, more than 50% of people aged 18-34 said that they receive their news primarily from the internet. According to a Pew Research survey from February 2022, only 21% of adults use cable as a source of news on a daily basis, while 36% say they never use cable news.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, sports leagues are beginning to move primetime games to streaming services; the NFL has announced that Thursday Night Football games will take place on Amazon Prime Video and MLB has been broadcasting baseball games on Apple TV.\nOne reason people may be making the switch is cost; streaming services tend to be priced lower than major cable providers.\n\nStreaming also allows viewers more targeted options and does so at a lower cost, eliminating unwanted channels and programming. In contrast to cable, the number of global subscribers for streaming services is only increasing.\n\nNetflix is currently leading the way with over 200 million global subscribers. Disney Plus and HBO Max, relative newcomers, are steadily gaining new subscribers. Disney Plus gained 44.8 million subscribers last year, the most of any streaming service.\nMany cable network companies have begun to make the switch to a streaming platform of their own, including Paramount Plus, a subsidiary of ViacomCBS, and Peacock, NBC\u2019s streaming platform."},

Since then though, the Maryland gas price has remained virtually the same even as national prices have declined by 1.8%, according to GasBuddy.\nAt the Royal Farms gas station on East Fayette Street in east Baltimore, Darrell Lee, 50, filled up his car so he could deliver DoorDash orders before going to his other job.\nTo Lee, the temporary lower prices are not significant, because they don\u2019t provide a much-needed long-term solution.\n\u201cGas can hurt the economy, because if you don\u2019t have a way to get to work, how can you put food on the table?\u201d Lee said.\nDarrell Lee, after filling his tank in west Baltimore in preparation for a DoorDash delivery, said the economy needs long-term solutions and not a temporary stop gap.

Her organization didn\u2019t have the money or staff to ease the pressure, she said.\u00a0\nOn average, 80% of over 4,000 registered Prince George\u2019s County nonprofits operate on $25,000 or less, Turner-Allen said to Capital News Service in a phone interview.\u00a0\nOf Turner-Allen\u2019s organization\u2019s 150 member nonprofits, 50% operate on $250,000 or less, the lowest tier of financial information the organization collects. Smaller organizations may not have the resources to participate in Nonprofit Prince George\u2019s County meetings, she said Wednesday.\nWhen a full-time employee can cost $30,000 to $40,000, these smaller organizations rely on volunteer work, but volunteers are burnt out, she said.\n\u201cPrince George\u2019s County has experienced the brunt of the pandemic,\u201d Turner-Allen said, calling the county a \u201cmajority-melanated community\u201d that felt great job loss and death tolls.\nNonprofits led by people of color were more likely to experience greater than 50% losses in every revenue stream than white-led nonprofits, according to Maryland Nonprofits\u2019 COVID-19 Pandemic and Racial Equity Survey, released Dec. 1, 2021. (Chart taken from Maryland Nonprofits\u2019 Dec. 1 COVID-19 Pandemic Racial and Equity Survey)\nMinority-led nonprofits made up 60% of those with revenues under $25,000, and were more likely to have experienced declines over 50% in all revenue sources, according to Maryland Nonprofits\u2019s COVID-19 Pandemic and Racial Equity Survey.\nThe survey received 710 unique responses from nonprofits across the state about finances from August 2020.\nThe Paycheck Protection Program, which reached 60% of responders, was the government funding opportunity most used by surveyed nonprofits. It was less accessible, however, to those led by people of color, the survey reported.\n\u201cThey were less likely to be eligible, less likely to hear about it and more likely to be declined than white-led organizations,\u201d according to the report.\nTurner-Allen tried to ameliorate the struggles of fellow nonprofits, and started work in June on a resource center for nonprofits in Vista Gardens Marketplace, a shopping mall in Bowie.\nAfter months of work painting, organizing furniture donations and calling in favors for wiring while her young son napped on a corner cot, Turner-Allen said the center has rented out three of its four office spaces to nonprofit organizations needing administrative spaces \u2014 but it won\u2019t break even until all four are filled.\nThe center also offers mailboxes for rent, giving nonprofits an opportunity to apply for some grants requiring a physical address.\nMailboxes like those available at Nonprofit Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s resource center in Bowie can help nonprofits list a physical address on grant applications, the organization\u2019s executive director, Tiffany Turner-Allen, said. (Photo courtesy of Nonprofit Prince George\u2019s County)\nFunding has been inaccessible in more ways than that, Turner-Allen explained.\nSome applications require the same long application no matter how much money is applied for, increasing the administrative burden on smaller nonprofits, she said \u2014 those without the resources to complete an application are sometimes unable to apply for more resources.\nOthers, like that for an operating assistance grant through the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, first announced aid would be distributed in August, but she said as of Dec. 7, nearly halfway through the fiscal year, money still hadn\u2019t been doled out.\nCarol Gilbert, assistant secretary for Neighborhood Revitalization in the state housing department whose office manages the grant, said in a phone call Tuesday that the awards are in the final stages of review and likely will be announced by the end of the calendar year.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not overwhelmed,\u201d Turner-Allen said of grant-managing agencies. \u201cI am saying that if a nonprofit operated in the same way the government is allowed to, we would be shut down.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an expectation that nonprofits can simply shoulder financial burdens, she said, continuing to do more with less in a crisis, the full mental strain of which is yet unknown.\nTurner-Allen compared resilience versus value to the care of a rugged pick-up truck versus an antique car. The truck is driven through mud and rocky roads, taking dings and scrapes because it\u2019s perceived it can. The antique car, however, is protected, kept under cover and wiped down.\n\u201cPressure bursts pipes. Get out of the narrative that we\u2019re resilient, and start valuing Black and brown leadership.\u201d\nTurner-Allen spoke at a \u201cPutting People First\u201d press conference Dec. 1 announcing a letter to state administrators requesting that $1 billion of surplus funds be reallocated to aiding nonprofits.\n\u201cThe stress and strain is unbearable, and it is untenable,\u201d she said at the conference, hosted by Maryland Nonprofits.\nOver 215 organizations and individuals have signed the letter, which has been submitted to Gov. Larry Hogan, Comptroller Peter Franchot, outgoing Treasurer Nancy Kopp, and Senate President Bill Ferguson, among others.\nThe letter lists four improvements for grant allocation processes: adequate staffing for public grant and contracting agencies; delegating administration to nonprofit intermediaries; simplified applications and reports; and timely payments.\nThe letter also lists overall priorities moving forward, including emphasizing basic human need services, like bilingual behavioral health services and food and rental assistance, as well as increasing pay to essential human service workers, who are likely to be women, minorities and sole breadwinners.\nThe letter also requests emphasis on funding vocational schools and apprenticeships to help skilled workers enter the workforce to support a post-pandemic economy."},

Elevated prices in October were wide-ranging, with prices rising in energy, shelter, food, used cars and trucks as well as new vehicles.\u00a0\nOne factor driving inflation, which is the rate at which prices increase over time, is too much government spending, said Dr. Antonio Saravia, an associate professor of economics at Mercer University, citing in part the stimulus checks that were issued to millions of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cNow you have all of this spending, all of this money in the economy, and people are using that to go purchase things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as we go to the stores and purchase things, prices go up.\u201d\nAnother reason inflation is rising is because the Federal Reserve, the country\u2019s central banking system, printed too much money so people could continue to make purchases during the pandemic, Saravia said.\u00a0\nDr. Erica Groshen, senior economics advisor at Cornell University\u2019s School of Industrial and Labor Relations and former commissioner of the BLS, noted contributing factors to rising prices include some prices returning to normal from prices that were lower during the pandemic. Prices also have been pushed up by supply chain disruptions, she said.\u00a0\nThose delays have \u201cmeant increases in prices for things that have been slow to arrive at our ports to get to our stores,\u201d Groshen said.\u00a0\nSaravia said supply chain disruptions wouldn\u2019t have changed prices so much if the Federal Reserve and government did not print and spend so much money.\nFood prices increased 0.9% last month, according to the CPI, and supermarket customers are noticing the higher prices.\u00a0\n\u201cEverything is like double the price, and it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d said Juanita Sherman, a 53-year-old Upper Marlboro resident and Metro employee. \u201cI\u2019ve been shopping for the last two weeks for Thanksgiving over pay periods so I can get everything.\u201d\n\nGas prices are rising too, according to the CPI, increasing 6.1% last month, which is the fifth consecutive monthly increase.\nJustin Hawkins from Chesapeake Beach owns a landscaping company. The 31-year-old said he increased the cost of his services because gas prices rose.\u00a0\n\u201cSo it\u2019s been an impact to (businesses) like mine because that\u2019s what I rely on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mowers take gas, any trimmers or anything like that \u2013 all that stuff takes gas. So I feel like the business I\u2019m in, it\u2019s definitely been impacted being that I rely on fuel.\u201d\nHow inflation impacts average consumers depends on what they buy, Groshen said. When inflation is higher, consumers either have to save less or spend more than they planned.\u00a0\nFor Kate Palermo, 38, who goes grocery shopping at least once a week, she plans more about what she\u2019s going to buy from the grocery store because of its higher prices.\u00a0\n\u201cI was never much of a meal prepper,\u201d the stay-at-home mom and Dunkirk resident said. \u201cWhen we lived in Washington, I would daily walk to the market there, and I would see what I\u2019d want to cook that night. But now\u2026it\u2019s easier and more sufficient to kind of prepare for the week.\u201d\nKeith Chapman, 69, of Upper Marlboro, said rising gas prices have caused him to cut back on visiting his grandkids and going out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous now,\u201d the retiree said. \u201c(Everything\u2019s) going up except your paycheck.\u201d\nPrince George\u2019s County resident Shahid Allah said he doesn\u2019t do as much long-distance driving anymore because of higher gas prices. (Brittany N. Gaddy/Capital News Service)\nGroshen thinks the rise in prices is likely temporary, explaining that slowing bond purchases, which the Federal Reserve earlier announced, and increasing interest rates will help cool off inflation.\u00a0\n\u201cNow we don\u2019t know exactly how long temporary is,\u201d she added.\nSaravia said he doesn\u2019t think inflation will slow down for at least the next two years because he doesn\u2019t see the Federal Reserve raising interest rates any time soon or slowing the printing of money. He also said he doesn\u2019t see the government slowing its spending.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting, thinking this is gonna subside,\u201d said Torey Milton, a 26-year old Millersville resident who works at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, talking about rising gas prices.\n\u201cNormally as soon as the fall hits the prices kind of fluctuate, but I thought things would have kind of gone back to normal now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I will have to adjust my budget now.\u201d"},

In 2020, that revenue was only $18.6 billion.\nThe 2021 report \u2014 covering July 2020 through June \u2014 was the first to cover a pandemic economy from start to finish, and estimates were made in the heat of the crisis.\nThe higher revenue stream is likely sustainable in the short term, revenue estimates bureau Director Andrew Schaufele wrote in the closeout report.\nSince some of the federal stimulus checks sit stagnant in personal savings accounts as savings rates hit record highs, \u201cwe have not yet seen the full COVID-19 economic story play out.\u201d\n\u201cThese are unprecedented times with unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy responses,\u201d Schaufele wrote. \u201cMuch like the virus, these norms are likely to change again.\u201d\nDespite over 100,000 Marylanders out of work, personal income tax garnered $11.7 billion \u2014 7.3% or $903 million more revenue than expected.\nMaryland lost 400,000 jobs at the beginning of the pandemic recession, with lower-wage jobs hit hardest, as shown in a slide from a virtual Bureau of Revenue Estimates meeting Sept. 30, 2021 (Courtesy of the Bureau of Revenue Estimates)\nSchaufele reports that at the beginning of the pandemic, Maryland lost 15% of its jobs, and a third of those jobs had not been regained by the beginning of this past fiscal year. He later said the recovery of those job losses will take time.\nBut the jobs still not filled tended to be lower wage positions, he said, with less impact on personal income tax revenue, since those with higher salaries pay higher percentages to the state.\nPay raises and bonuses constituted major wage gains that will likely carry forward, according to the report.\nFranchot called this effect \u201cthe tale of two Marylands\u201d in a news release Wednesday.\nOne one hand, \u201cthose without a job see their unemployment benefits expiring,\u201d Franchot wrote. \u201cRenters are facing homelessness since rental relief funds are not being disbursed quickly enough and the eviction moratorium has been lifted.\u201d\nOn the other hand, the other two-thirds of Marylanders are able to thrive in spite of less-than-ideal conditions.\nSchaufele said that the pandemic recession has seen an increase, and even an acceleration, of personal income, not a decrease over all.\nAnother factor driving the surprise surplus is corporate income tax on company profits. This tax contributed $321 million, which is 39% more than last fiscal year and 28% more than anticipated.\nBusinesses cut costs and employees. They may not have to pay for leases on workplaces when all workers are remote. On top of that, consumer spending boomed as federal fiscal stimulus checks hit local economies, the report states.\n\u201cThe unequal impact of the pandemic,\u201d Schaufele wrote, \u201cmeans firms in the least affected sectors have done very well.\u201d\nAt Thursday\u2019s virtual forecast revising meeting, Schaufele recommended increasing the 2022 general fund revenue estimate to $21.2 billion and that of 2023 to $22.2 billion.\nSchaufele at the meeting noted that changes to the pandemic as COVID-19 evolves, as well as possible surges in cases as schools continue in person, could be significant risks to the workforce, but higher vaccination rates could offset those risks.\nThe number of years it takes Maryland to recover jobs lost in historic recessions has varied greatly, as shown by a slide presented at a virtual Bureau of Revenue Estimates meeting Sept. 30, 2021. The chart shows percent of job market lost versus number of months to recovery. (Courtesy of Bureau of Revenue Estimates)\nThe federal fiscal stimulus checks created the equivalent of a professional services industry, such as lawyers and doctors, to the Maryland economy, Schaufele said.\nInflation rates topped 4% in April and 5% in June, Schaufele said, ramping up with supply chain and durables shortages.\nThe inflation hike is mostly temporary in nature, he said. Prices may subside as those issues resolve, but wage growth will continue to pressure inflation.\nFranchot recommended placing most of the state\u2019s surplus in a rainy day fund and delivering funds to those who may need it most.\n\u201cThe state\u2019s surplus is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in programs that lift all Marylanders and help stabilize housing and other critical expenses for our lower- and middle-income families,\u201d Franchot wrote in a statement.\nFranchot said the stimulus checks did exactly what they were intended to do, but \u201cthis sugar high from federal dollars will eventually wear off.\u201d\n[Like what you\u2019re reading?

The combination of benefit programs led to a projected 6.3 percent poverty rate in the state, which translates to keeping an estimated 729,000 Marylanders out of poverty.\u00a0\nThis year\u2019s poverty rate projections in the United States fell significantly below 2018\u2019s estimates, according to the Urban Institute.\u00a0\nUsing the same methods, the annual poverty rate projections nationwide dropped from 13.9 percent to 7.7. percent between 2018 and 2021.\u00a0\nBut the extension of unemployment benefits under the American Rescue Plan ended on Sept. 6, a decision that could influence the projected poverty numbers for Maryland and the rest of the nation.\u00a0\nThe extended benefits gave people unemployment payments beyond the normal number of weeks they would be entitled to in Maryland.\nThe benefits also offered $300 weekly in addition to the standard $400, according to Kali Schumitz, director of communications and partner engagement at the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, a nonprofit research organization.\u00a0\n\u201cWe definitely would expect the expanded unemployment ending to have some kind of impact,\u201d Schumitz said.\n\u201cBecause it just happened, we don\u2019t know exactly what the impact of that is going to be, but we do know that most people who are still receiving unemployment assistance payments in Maryland were on those extended benefits programs,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan, signed into law in March, sought to alleviate hardships during the pandemic and offer assistance to working families.\u00a0\nThe $1.9 trillion package included direct payments, increases in tax credits, an extension of unemployment insurance and small business relief, according to the White House\u2019s official website.\u00a0\u00a0\nRep. David Trone, D-Gaithersburg, a member of the Joint Economic Committee, played a role in the passage of the Biden package.\n\u201cAs the Joint Economic Committee\u2019s report shows, the American Rescue Plan was crucial to reducing projected poverty rates in Maryland and across the country during this public health crisis,\u201d Trone told Capital News Service.\nMaryland\u2019s projected poverty numbers for this year, although county rates vary considerably, remain lower than many other states, such as Virginia, New York and California.\nSchumitz attributed Maryland\u2019s lower poverty numbers to supplemental federal assistance programs and the state\u2019s own working family tax credit.\u00a0\nAlthough Maryland also targeted relief to undocumented people who faced exclusions from the various federal programs, Schumitz said the effort did not erase the racial inequalities still affecting communities across the state.\u00a0\n\u201cThe hardship rates in Maryland remain well above pre-pandemic levels,\u201d Schumitz said. \u201cThere (are) still really large racial inequities because people of color faced the hardships of the pandemic and on top of the existing structural barriers that are already causing more people of color in Maryland to be more likely to be in poverty.\u201d\u00a0\nUsing the supplemental poverty measure, the Urban Institute drew from the Census Bureau\u2019s methods for estimating poverty.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s the traditional, official poverty measure that\u2019s been around for decades, and that one just counts people\u2019s cash income,\u201d said Laura Wheaton, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and an author of the report. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t count things like tax credits or SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits or housing subsidies.\u201d\u00a0\nTo define the poverty level, the institute used more recent data on what people spend on food, shelter, clothing and utilities, according to Wheaton.\u00a0\nThe poverty measure also subtracts taxes and work-related and childcare expenses from individuals\u2019 incomes.\u00a0\n\u201cWhereas the Census Bureau releases reports each year with their estimates of poverty under the supplemental poverty measure based on survey data, we extend that because\u2026a lot of times in survey data people underreport fair receipt of certain benefits,\u201d Wheaton said.\u00a0\n\u201cWe use a model that corrects for that underreporting, so it brings benefits up to the levels paid according to the government and other government sources,\u201d she explained.\u00a0\nApart from the American Rescue Plan\u2019s impact, Wheaton said the Urban Institute\u2019s data on the projected number of people kept out of poverty in 2021 also includes the standard safety net programs and the other benefit expansions made in response to the pandemic.\nRegardless of these numbers, the Urban Institute said its analysis was based only on estimates; complete data on 2021 will not be available from the Census Bureau until September 2022.\u00a0\n\u201cBut we know that people want to have an idea of what\u2019s happening in real time, especially in these pandemic times,\u201d Wheaton said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing these kinds of projections, to try to give people an idea of what likely is happening, that it\u2019s a projection.\u201d"},

Our personal information is out there, and it is marketed by these different groups,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cAnd when you have this crisis, scamsters and organized crime step in and say \u2018We\u2019re going to use these lists or buy this information and see what we can get out of it\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cAnd just for the record, the lieutenant governor is not unemployed,\u201d Comptroller Peter Franchot, D, joked and then said to Robinson, \u201cWe are the paymaster, but we are going to rely on you to confirm that there is as little fraud as possible.\u201d\nHogan announced at a press conference on July 15 that the state had uncovered more than 47,500 fraudulent unemployment insurance claims in Maryland, which totaled more than $501 million.\nThe labor department has found 384,651 fraudulent claims since the beginning of the pandemic out of the 447,817 flagged, according to data on the department\u2019s website.\nThe data also shows about 90% of the 176,561 out-of-state and about 83% of the 271, 256 in-state claims that have been identified as potentially fraudulent did not upload verification or were reviewed and denied.\nThese numbers can be expected to change as more fraudulent claims are flagged and an investigation with the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Office of the Inspector General and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office continues, according to an announcement on the department\u2019s website.\nThe FBI announced in December that from 2015 until 2019, Maryland was ranked 5th in the country for the amount of \u201cmoney mules,\u201d or people \u201cwho trade illegally obtained money between different payment accounts\u201d, in the state.\nIn order to further combat the fraud, the Maryland Department of Labor is planning to contract with a vendor that will help to prevent and detect fraud, according to Maryland Department of Labor Director of Communications, Fallon Pearre.\nIf a scammer has the correct date of birth and Social Security number and the claim gets validated without being detected by the department\u2019s \u201ctriggers\u201d, then a notice is sent to the claimant\u2019s employer, which Robinson said is the department\u2019s \u201cplan B\u201d to catch fraud.\n\u201cIt shows that it can\u2019t be just a mechanical process to just roll checks out to everyone who\u2019s asking for them,\u201d Rutherford said.\nThe labor department has also launched a new, modernized unemployment insurance system, which Robinson said has allowed for more efficient fraud detection.\nThe Office of the Maryland Attorney General has recently released a webpage with resources to help people report the fraud and protect their identity.\nIf a person believes their identity was used to fraudulently file an unemployment claim, they can report it by:\n\nVisiting MDunemployment.com,\nCalling the UI Fraud Hotline at 1-800-492-6804 (Press 1),\nEmailing ui.fraud@maryland.gov\n\nNo one is liable for any benefits paid out in their name if they are fraudulent, according to Robinson."},

The law provided a provision to help small businesses continue to pay their employees, as well as fund other essential business expenses. \nFrom a dataset of approximately 60,000 loans issued to Maryland businesses, each less than $150,000, the average loan amount in a predominantly white zip code was $36,083 while the average for a predominantly Black zip code was $29,080. The $7,003 difference means that Black communities are receiving about 21.5 percent less money in loans. \nThe map below displays the average loan size of each zip code in the state. Darker red areas indicate a higher average loan amount in that zip code. Toggling through the different layers will group the zip code averages by predominantly white or Black zip codes. \n\nBlack communities in Maryland received on average 20% less in PPP loans compared to white communities\nThe average loan from the Paycheck Protection Plan in a Black community was $7,003 less when compared to a loan in a white community. The \u201cAvg. Loans\u201d layer compares the average loan size, in dollars, of all zip codes to one another. Toggling the statewide comparison off, the zip codes are then sorted by if they are predominantly white or Black to compare the average loan size.\nMissing zip codes are attributed to data estimates for that population having a margin of error greater than or equal to 10% or because it is neither a majority white or Black community (i.e. majority minority communities). Click here for a larger version of this map.\n\n\nExploring the same dataset, the average number of loans for a white community was 356 and 289 in a Black community, equivalent to a 20.8 percent difference in the number of loans. To visualize the difference in the number of loans, the map below groups the zip codes by whether they are predominantly white or Black. Darker colors indicate a higher number of loans in that zip code. \n\nBlack communities in Maryland received an average of 289 loans, compared to white communities that received 396 loans on average\nThe average number of loans for Black communities in Maryland from the Paycheck Protection Program is 20.8 percent less than that for white communities. The map displays the number of loans for each zip code, color coded by if that zip code is predominantly white or Black.\nMissing zip codes are attributed to data estimates for that population having a margin of error greater than or equal to 10% or because it is neither a majority white or Black community (i.e. majority minority communities). Click here for a larger version of this map.\n\n\nUsing the American Community Survey to estimate demographic data for each zip code in the state, a predominantly white or Black community is defined as a population with a percentage of that race greater than or equal to 50.0 percent. A map of estimated demographic data for Maryland can be explored here.\nTo avoid harming any small businesses, the SBA anonymized the businesses in the dataset.\nAs a result, the granularity of the analysis is constrained to examining available factors like loan amounts, the zip codes where these businesses are located, the number of jobs reported, and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code that describes what industry the business serves. The names of specific companies, and other identifying factors, were not included in the data.\nAlthough two weeks ago a federal judge ruled in favor of media companies that requested access to the fully identifiable information for all businesses that received a loan, the SBA was then granted a delay on having to release this information. \nThe highest Paycheck Protection Program loan in Maryland of $149,975 was awarded to a Hagerstown-based limited liability company in the air transportation industry with 30 reported employees, according to the dataset. Examples of the work they specialize in may include aircraft maintenance and repair, as well as aircraft testing services, according to their NAICS code. \n\n\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, the lowest loan \u2013 amounting to $6 \u2013 belonged to a northern Baltimore business in the gift, novelty, and souvenir industry, according to the data and NAICS. \nMissing information in loan applications combined with the ability of lenders to approve partial loans might explain some of the lower loans in the dataset. \n\n\n\nIn white communities, full-service restaurants appear to have been awarded the most loans, cross checking the dataset with NAICS. In juxtaposition, religious organizations stood out as the single most number of loans in Black communities. \nIn a landmark and contentious decision, the SBA extended loan eligibility for non-profits and by extension, religious establishments. Critics of the decision claimed the eligibility clause deteriorates the separation of church and state. The SBA invoked the second portion of the first amendment to defend its decision, citing that they would not want to bar certain applicants on the basis of religious background.\nWithin the set of white communities, Rockville business owners applied for the most loans totaling $60.7 million, funding 6,554 jobs. \nFor Black communities, the area of Upper Marlboro, that includes towns like Glenarden, Largo, and Ardmore, reported the most loans, totaling $18.6 million for 1,957 jobs. \nOn a national level, the SBA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General found that minority, women, and veteran-owned businesses were not prioritized as required by the Paycheck Protection Program\u2019s statute in the CARES Act. \nAlthough the SBA was charged with disseminating guidance for lenders on how money should be disbursed to ensure equity, the inspector general found no evidence of any such guidance being passed down to lenders requiring them to prioritize this special population of small business owners.\nGiven that there was no place for applicants to input standard demographic information on the loan application in the first round of loans, the report recommended a place for demographic information when businesses begin the process of applying for loan forgiveness. \nLess than 4 percent of the records in Maryland list the business owner\u2019s race; about 13 percent report the business owner\u2019s gender; and less than half a percent are veteran business owners. \nThe inspector general took issue with the SBA\u2019s stipulation requiring borrowers to allocate at least 75 percent of the loan toward payroll expenses to be eligible for full loan forgiveness, despite there being no requirement in the CARES Act. The SBA also ruled that businesses were subjected to pay back any loans that were not forgiven within two years, when the CARES Act provided up to 10 years for repayment.  \nBy nature of their size, small businesses have more operational than employee expenses, resulting in tens of thousands of borrowers burdened with repaying those non-payroll expenses in less than 2 years, said the report. \nTo rectify the consequences of the loan forgiveness eligibility requirements, the report recommended the SBA \u201c\u2026evaluate the potential negative impact to borrowers\u2026and update the requirements, as deemed necessary.\u201d\nFollowing the release of the report, in early June the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 was signed into law, providing some retroactive amendments to the program from the CARES Act. The SBA issued an updated set of interim rules in accordance with this amendment. \nRevisions included providing a new, but optional, borrower demographic information form submitted when businesses apply for loan forgiveness, as well as a 15 percent reduction in the proportion of the loan that must be used toward payroll expenses to qualify for full loan forgiveness, according to a June issue of the Federal Register. \nBusinesses that received a loan prior to the enactment of the Flexibility Act were allowed to discuss extending the time they had for repayment with their lenders. Businesses applying for a loan on or after the enactment of the Flexibility Act were given a minimum of 5 years to repay any loans. \nThrough and through, politicians, lenders, and business owners have found difficulty managing the varying levels of rules and regulations that have come with the Paycheck Protection Program. With a more robust dataset likely to be released sometime in the near future, there will be more opportunities to assess the true impact of the program within the state of Maryland and nationally."},

Without enough merchandise to ship out, it is no longer scheduled to sail to Baltimore.\nLess merchandise from China means fewer goods like food, clothing and \u201cbig box\u201d electronic goods will flow into stores, Acting Executive Director David Thomas told Capital News Service. He said Friday morning that the West Coast is getting hit the hardest with 81 cancelled shipments so far.\n\u201cThat is going to have a significant impact,\u201d Thomas told lawmakers. \u201cWhen you start going to the store, eventually, you\u2019re going to have an issue where what you want to buy, the right size, the right color \u2014 whatever \u2014 is not going to be there.\u201d\nAbout 2,000 ships dock at The Port of Baltimore each year. The proportion of ships coming from Asia has risen in the last decade to about 30% of the port\u2019s arrivals, a port spokesman told Capital News Service.\nThomas said U.S. companies don\u2019t have goods to ship here because their Chinese factories haven\u2019t been producing as many goods as that country deals with the outbreak.\nThe risk of transmission from sailors to dock workers is less of a worry in Baltimore because the virus is thought to have a maximum 14-day incubation period, according to the Maryland Health Department website. That\u2019s far shorter than the 37 days it takes to make it to Baltimore from China by cargo ship. Vessels are also required to notify the U.S. Coast Guard 96 hours before they enter U.S. waters and say whether anyone on board is sick.\nThe company that operates the Seagirt Marine Terminal, Ports America Chesapeake, is cutting back their hours of operation starting Monday because fewer goods are arriving, a Port of Baltimore spokesperson said Friday.

If the answer is yes to either question, that passenger won\u2019t be allowed on the cruise. The terminal operator, Intercruises, will provide additional medical screening to passengers with passports from impacted areas.\nDuring a press conference Thursday at the state\u2019s Maryland Emergency Management Agency in Reisterstown, Gov.

Larry Hogan \u2014 said that Maryland\u2019s unemployment rate is the lowest it\u2019s been in 11 years.\nRutherford said that it\u2019s created a challenge for some skilled labor and skilled professions in finding labor.\n\u201cOne of the things that we\u2019ve been working at, the last couple of years, particularly with one of the local school districts, is getting the trades back into these local schools,\u201d Rutherford said.\u00a0\n\u201cConstruction trades are willing to help because they need people,\u201d Rutherford said.\nRutherford said there is a sense of urgency in bringing trades back into the schools.\n\u201cThere are young people who could use these skills and an opportunity to make a very good living coming out of school,\u201d Rutherford said.\nThe governor\u2019s office declined to comment and referred questions about the increase in costs to the university, which also declined to comment but referred calls to trade associations to reach out to on industry trends.\nThe cost of labor increases in part because people have to make the lumber and materials, which includes production cost, said Aydukovic.\nThe cost of professional services, such as architecture, engineering and financing, also has an additional cost.\nAydukovic said that there is wage inflation among construction companies across the United States, \u201cfrom the lumber yards, to the skilled craftspeople on site, to the professionals in the office, that are contributing to the increasing costs of construction.\u201d\nHe said that these jobs, which include the groundwork of being electricians and plumbers, and laborers of a certain sort, take a lot of brains and dedication.\nAydukovic explained that it took until 2016 before profit margins returned to normal and some contractors just simply ran out of runway waiting for normalcy to return.\n\u201cWhat parent would encourage their kids to go into construction when it was nothing but bad news for the better part of six years, so we lost almost an entire generation of new entries to the industry,\u201d Aydukovic told Capital News Service.\u00a0\u00a0\nAydukovic said that there were several contractors that went out of business, one of them being Truland Group Inc., an electrical contracting business which filed for bankruptcy protection more than five years ago.\nMarco Giamberardino, vice president for government and public affairs of the National Electrical Contractors Association, said there\u2019s a serious need to build the next generation of skilled electricians.\n\u201cIn the electrical construction industry alone, Baby Boomers make up about 70 percent of our supervision,\u201d Giamberardino said. \u201cApprenticeship graduates go on to become journeyman electricians as well as project managers, contractors, engineers, training directors and college graduates.\u201d\u00a0\nDaniel Loveless, a business manager of Steamfitters Union Local 602, said that tradespeople are making upward of $100,000 a year out of high school.\nLoveless said that it\u2019s important not to mislead young men and women in their last year of high school to take heating, ventilation and air conditioning training, thinking that they will immediately go and perform the job because it\u2019s a five-year intensive program.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re a very diverse trade and I\u2019d like them to see high schools prepare students but also I\u2019d like to see us be able to talk to these kids so that they can be aware of opportunities like this,\u201d Loveless said.\nLoveless wants to \u201cget the message to the parents to have a conversation with them about their child and allow them to know more about what trades and construction people do so they don\u2019t uneducatedly discourage their child from pursuing a career like this.\u201d\n\u201cCollege isn\u2019t for everyone, whether it is a financial reason,\u201d Loveless said. \u201cSome people are meant to work with their hands and build.\u201d\nLoveless said that contractors sometimes go out of business because it\u2019s highly competitive and sometimes when they are competing to win a contract, they end up losing money.\nHe said lately there is more work out there and the industry has become more competitive.\nLoveless said his union took in about 225 new apprentices last year and expects to take in about 250 this year.\n\u201cIf we have any shortage of manpower, not gender specific, it has to do with a specialized and specific skill set. So we do not have a real shortage of people for our contractors,\u201d Loveless said.\u00a0\nThe state\u2019s Department of Education in November published its four-year Career and Technical education plan, which aims to prepare students for jobs \u201cmeeting the skilled workforce needs of employers, including in existing and emerging in-demand industry sectors and occupations.\u201d\u00a0\nThat report cites state labor projections, which anticipate at least 30,000 more construction-related jobs needed by 2026.\u00a0\nAdam Mendelson, a spokesman with the Maryland State Education Association, said that expanding career and technical education is a key component of the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, recommended by the state\u2019s Kirwan commission.\u00a0\n\u201cEducators know that making sure that more students have access to dynamic career, technology and education programs won\u2019t just enhance the quality of our schools, it will also help our economy when more students graduate with job-ready industry certifications for well-paying jobs,\u201d Mendelson said.\nBoth projects are scheduled to be considered Wednesday, at the next Board of Public Works meeting.\n*Editors: The spelling of Bob Aydukovic\u2019s name has been corrected in this story."},

Larry Hogan announced in October that a pilot episode for a potential new SHOWTIME series, \u201cThe President is Missing\u201d, is set to begin filming in Maryland in early 2020. Maryland Film Office director Jack Gerbes is optimistic about its prospective influence on the state\u2019s economy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that [\u2018The President is Missing\u2019] will be on the same scale as a \u2018House of Cards\u2019 in regards to the number of hires, in regards to the number of businesses affected positively by the production,\u201d Gerbes said.\nThe potential series is based on the titular novel written by James Patterson and Bill Clinton. At the time of its debut, the novel reportedly sold more hardcover copies during its first week \u2014 June 4 to June 10, 2018 \u2014 than any other hardcover fiction work since 2016.\n\u201cWe are thrilled that SHOWTIME will shoot the pilot for The President is Missing in Maryland, and we are hopeful that it will become another successful series for our state,\u201d Hogan said in an October press release. \u201cMaryland offers an outstanding destination for filming, with a highly-skilled crew base, talented actors, and a variety of locations that can easily double as our nation\u2019s capital.\u201d\nMaryland Department of Commerce Secretary Kelly M. Schulz added in the release that the show could \u201cprovide an incredible impact on Maryland\u2019s economy if it becomes a SHOWTIME series, including the potential for new jobs and additional revenue for local businesses throughout the region.\u201d\n\nWithout Maryland\u2019s tax credit program and rich film history, though, productions such as \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cThe President is Missing\u201d would have little reason to film in the state.\nAfter the passage of Maryland Senate Bill 1154 in May 2018, the state\u2019s film industry was given long-term resources, providing more consistency for productions looking for stability over the course of multiple years and seasons.\nThe bill, passed by Hogan and put into effect in June 2018, ensured there would be a tax incentive program for at least five more years while also allocating funds for each of those years. Among the changes, 10% of the annual tax credit figure would be allocated toward Maryland small or independent films.\n\u201cWe have the most consistent program now that we\u2019ve ever had in the history of our incentive program,\u201d Gerbes said. \u201cBecause of the consistency of the program, because of the legislation that the governor signed, we can go after a series that can be here 3, 4, 5, 6 years.\u201d\nBefore SB 1154\u2019s passage, funding would be determined on a short-term basis, Gerbes said, leaving potential productions skeptical about long-term filming in Maryland.\n\u201cVeep,\u201d an HBO series starring actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, filmed in Baltimore for its first four seasons \u2014 which premiered from 2012 to 2015 \u2014 but moved its production to California for its final three seasons due in large part to Maryland\u2019s unstable tax credit program.\n\u201cAt the time, we didn\u2019t know whether there would be incentives,\u201d Gerbes said, \u201cand California put incentives on the table for them.\u201d\nThe show had over $165 million worth of impact on Maryland\u2019s economy before departing.\nMeanwhile, despite uncertainty about Maryland\u2019s tax incentives before SB 1154, \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d \u2014 which once threatened to cut filming ties with the state over tax credit disputes \u2014 continued to film in Maryland. It generated over $245 million in economic impact in its final two seasons while employing more than 3,400 local actors and technicians and using the services of nearly 3,500 local businesses in that timespan.\n\nThe ability to attract such large-scale, economically significant productions wasn\u2019t always so heavily reliant on incentives.\n\u201cThe first half of my career here, a studio, a producer, a network director would call, they would say \u2026 we\u2019re looking for beaches, we\u2019re looking for, in the case of \u2018Wedding Crashers\u2019, a beautiful mansion on the water,\u201d said Gerbes, who is entering his 29th year with the Maryland Film Office. \u201cIn the case of \u2018Runaway Bride\u2019, we\u2019re looking for small towns and bucolic, rolling hills.\u201d\nWith Maryland\u2019s introduction of a film rebate program in 2005, in addition to other states developing their own programs, the focus shifted.\n\u201cThen the first question became, \u2018What\u2019s your incentive program like?\u2019\u201c Gerbes said. \u201c\u2018Do you have enough incentives to justify me coming to Maryland to shoot?\u2019\u201d\nOther states began to employ more tempting programs. Georgia, which has no cap and allows films to earn up to 30% in tax credits, provided more than $800 million in credits in fiscal year 2017. Maryland had only $11.51 million in funding for that period.\nSince replacing its rebate program with a tax incentive program, Maryland has provided credits to a handful of films \u2014 including \u201cJamesy Boy,\u201d \u201cBetter Living Through Chemistry\u201d and \u201cPing Pong Summer\u201d \u2014 and the aforementioned series \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cVeep\u201d.\n\nWhile Maryland is unable to stack up to states like Georgia in how much it can award in tax credits, the goal remains the same: stimulate the economy. And there\u2019s belief that \u201cThe President is Missing\u201d will do just that.\n\u201cWhen it boils down to it, it means it creates jobs in the creative economy, and it creates revenue for thousands of businesses \u2014 Maryland businesses \u2014 that support the industry,\u201d Gerbes said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really important.\u201d"},

Maxine Waters, D-California, who is chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee and a critic of the agency\u2019s move.\u00a0\nKraninger added that states should regulate payday lending, as they \u201chave determined it is in their residents\u2019 interests to be able to use such products, subject to state-law limitations.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nThe 2017 Payday Rule governs \u201cunfair and abusive\u201d lending practices, such as withdrawing money from borrowers\u2019 bank accounts without their knowledge, neglecting borrowers\u2019 \u201cability to pay\u201d when approving loans, and issuing balloon loans, in which payments are consistently lower for the majority of the lending term but \u201cballoon\u201d to one significantly larger payment at the end.\u00a0\nIn June, CFPB finalized a separate rule that said it is not considering the ability-to-pay requirements \u201cat this time,\u201d and delayed the August compliance date to Nov. 19, 2020. The agency is considering loan requirements and disclosure practices for lenders.\nIn August, more than 100 House Democrats joined Waters in a letter asking the CFPB to abide by the rule\u2019s initial provisions.\u00a0\nReps. Jamie Raskin, D-Bethesda; Anthony Brown, D-Largo; and the late Elijah Cummings, D-Baltimore, were among the signers.\u00a0\nIn a Financial Services Committee hearing earlier this month, Kraninger said the bureau is working to define \u201cabusive\u201d as it pertains to lending.\u00a0\nThe hearing lasted for more than three hours, with Kraninger in the hot seat fielding concerns from both parties.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not following direction of your staff to help consumers that are harmed, then you are absolutely worthless,\u201d Rep.

Lenders often have access to borrowers\u2019 accounts and withdraw the money once the borrower receives a paycheck, leaving the person with little funds for other expenses, Born\u00e9 said.\u00a0\nBorrowers may take out another loan as a result, putting them in a \u201cdebt trap,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nA 2014 report from the CFPB found that 80% of payday loans were renewed within 14 days, and the majority of borrowers renewed their loans so many times that they ended up paying more in fees than the principal amounts.\n\u201cThe delay is the bureau\u2019s way of trying to buy time to gut the rule all together so that it never goes into effect,\u201d Born\u00e9 said.\u00a0\nThe Washington Post reported Tuesday that payday lenders are planning to donate as much money as possible to President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, hoping that a relationship with the president\u2019s office will weaken regulations against them.\nOne of the biggest takeaways of the 2017 Payday Rule is that it would cap interest rates at 36% for the length of the lending term, which is typically a few weeks.\nIn Maryland, payday loans up to $2,000 have a maximum annual interest rate of 33%, and a maximum monthly rate of 2.75%. For loans greater than $2,000, interest is capped at 24% annually and 2% monthly.\nBureau\u2019s structure is under court challenge\nThe constitutionality of the agency\u2019s structure has been questioned in recent years.\u00a0\nIn 2017, Trump and the Department of Justice determined that a statute that says CFPB directors can only be removed from their position for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\u201d was unconstitutional. \n\nThey argued that this restriction unfairly insulates the agency from the president\u2019s executive control.\u00a0\nThe U.S. District Court for the Central District of California denied this claim in a lawsuit against the consumer bureau by Seila Law, a California law firm. The case has since gone to the Supreme Court and oral arguments will be heard in the spring.\nBut in September, Kraninger, too, adopted the administration\u2019s reasoning.\n\u201cI have decided that the Bureau should adopt the Department of Justice\u2019s view that the for-cause removal provision is unconstitutional,\u201d she wrote in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. She added that she advised the agency\u2019s lawyers not to fight the opinion in court.\nKraninger reaffirmed her decision at the October congressional hearing.\u00a0\nHowever, Maloney criticized Kraninger\u2019s stance, calling it \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to congressional intent that the CFPB should an independent regulator.\u00a0\nBut several House Republicans applauded the decision.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you have an unaccountable organization, with a director that not even the president can remove, that is going to be problematic,\u201d Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Michigan, said. \u201cI appreciate your efforts in trying to put this back in a reasonable box.\u201d\u00a0\nThe CFPB was founded in 2011 in response to the 2008 recession."},

Global competition exacerbates this issue, with prices for services like logo design dropping significantly over the past decade.", "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2013 The \u201cgig\u201d economy has increased employment opportunities for thousands of Maryland residents, including high-skilled and low-skilled workers. But as the number of people jumping into gig work grows, the competition for jobs means smaller paychecks for many.\nIt\u2019s well-known that the income of taxi drivers has been hit hard by the growth in ride-sharing companies Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc., which have saturated cities with low-cost cars for hire. However, earnings also are falling for graphic designers, freelance writers and others who face strong competition for jobs. In some cases, the competition is coming from workers in other countries who can access the internet as easily as Americans to vie for jobs.\n\u201cTen years ago, maybe a graphic artist would have charged you four, five hundred dollars for a logo design,\u201d said Angela Heath, a College Park, Maryland resident and the chief executive of TKC Inc., which advises businesses and workers about the gig economy. \u201cNow you can get logos done for $30. Some of that global competition has driven some of the prices down.\u201d\nThere is no standard definition or measurement of the gig economy. One of the broadest measures, which counts more than 40 million workers, includes independent contractors, freelancers and other self-employed Americans who work short-term jobs, or gigs, rather than hold steady employment with a single company.\nA narrower definition counts \u201con-demand\u201d workers, which includes people who get jobs through digital platforms, such as drivers who pick up fares through Uber, carpenters who find jobs on TaskRabbit.com, designers who book customers on Thumbtack.com and skilled professionals who get jobs on TopTal.com. Emergent Research, a firm in San Francisco that tracks the gig economy, estimates that the on-demand workforce numbered nearly four million workers in 2016 and is expected to double by the year 2020. \u00a0\n\u201cAnyone entering the workforce today, at some point in their career, is likely to work in a gig or independent manner,\u201d said Ellen Harpel, an economist who tracks trends in the Washington region, including suburban Maryland and Virginia. \u201cIt\u2019s not like everyone\u2019s going to be doing it all of the time, but everyone will probably do it at some time.\u201d\nRevealing census data\nThe federal government doesn\u2019t compile data specifically on gig workers, but economists rely on a U.S. Census Bureau data series called \u201cnon-employer statistics,\u201d meaning small establishments, or businesses, that don\u2019t have employees. Economists reason that most establishments that don\u2019t have employees are actually independent workers who operate as businesses for tax purposes.\n\nThe Census data shows that between 2006 and 2016, the number of non-employee establishments rose 18.8 percent in Maryland to 487,540. But average receipts for the Maryland establishments during the 10-year period declined 15.8 percent, after adjusting for inflation, to $44,053 in 2016. The trends for Maryland closely track the national averages.\nNot surprisingly, the taxi and limousine sector saw a large increase in establishments and a steep decline in receipts. The number of non-employer taxi and limousine establishments jumped more than \u00a0400 percent in Maryland between 2006 and 2016, while inflation-adjusted average receipts declined nearly 48 percent to $16,231.\nThe Census data also shows declines in some white-collar occupations, such as specialized design services, which includes graphic designers. The number of \u00a0establishments in that category rose almost 13 percent between 2006 and 2016 to nearly 4,000 while average receipts were down nearly 25 percent, after adjusting for inflation, to $33,941.\nThe decline in revenues for design services partly reflects increased global competition made possible through a myriad of freelancer internet platforms that have popped up in the past decade, said Steve King, an economist and partner at Emergent. \nWorldwide gig economy\nFiverr.com, for example, which is based in Tel Aviv, Israel, is used by freelance and gig workers from around the world, including those in low-wage locales such as India and Eastern Europe. On Fiverr, companies and consumers can hire artists for as little as $10 per project.\n\u201cThe quality is quite good and the wages are substantially lower,\u201d King said, which means the American workers often have to lower their prices to get business.\nEconomists note that while receipts for some categories are falling, they point out that the size of the declines may be overstated by the large number of workers who hold down full-time traditional jobs during the week and moonlight in the gig economy during evenings and on weekends.\nThat describes 57-year-old Teresa Bronson, who is employed by the state of Maryland during the week and spends weekends running Shore is Delicious Catering by Teresa.\nThe Eastern Shore company gets 60 percent of its business through Thumbtack and the remainder through referrals and WeddingWire, an online marketplace for the wedding industry. She enjoys the flexibility of working when she wants to work and likes using the internet platforms. \nBut as the platforms have become more crowded with caterers, Bronson says there isn\u2019t always enough work to go around, which has pushed down catering rates. \n\u201cI\u2019ve lost out to other caterers,\u201d she said. And at times, \u201cI have taken my quote down to get jobs but not down to the point to where I\u2019m losing money,\u201d she said.\nSome are doing well\nNot all gig workers are suffering. Management consultants, computer network designers, information technology specialists and others with special skills are enjoying rising incomes, Heath said. \n\u201cTheir prices can go up because they don\u2019t have that global pressure from competition,\u201d she said, adding that many companies like to hire specialized workers who near their businesses.\nAccording to the Census data, average receipts for Maryland establishments in computer design and related services were $60,268 in 2016, up 13.6 percent from 2006 after adjusting for inflation. The number of establishments, meanwhile, declined 7 percent to about 7,000. \n\nBrian Loebig, a resident of Silver Spring who specializes in web design and social media marketing, is a prime example of how technology professionals are enjoying success in the gig economy. \nAfter being laid off from a $85,000-a-year job at a nonprofit in Roanoke, Virginia, in 2010, he started Loebig Ink LLC, which specializes in web design, social media and search optimization.\nIn his first year on his own, Loebig estimates that he earned about $35,000, but his income doubled each year for the first three years and he says his income will grow to about $500,000 this year.\n While his clients \u2013 most are in Washington, Maryland and Virginia \u2013 receive proposals from international workers offering to do similar jobs for less, Loebig\u2019s proximity to his customers has been a big advantage.\n\u201cI would say that you have a strategic competitive advantage, especially on the internet, if you\u2019re local,\u201d Loebig said. \u201cPeople want to hire people next to them. You could hire someone in India for $15 an hour or even less, but a lot of people, they like to know that somebody\u2019s physically near them.\u201d\nWhile he used multiple internet platforms as he grew his business, including Craigslist, Thumbtack and Elance (now part of Upwork.com), Loebig said he stayed away from Fiverr because there was too much international low-cost competition with people offering services for as little as $5 an hour.\nEmergent\u2019s King said the divergent income trends of workers like Loebig when compared to other workers, are part of a national pattern. \n\u201cYears ago when we started tracking the gig economy, we thought it was interesting that there wasn\u2019t as much income inequality,\u201d King said. \u201cBut over time we\u2019ve seen income distributions widen and the middle income segment share of full-time independent workers decline. This is likely due to the same forces that are causing this in the overall economy \u2013 the hollowing out of middle class jobs, growing demand and higher pay for highly skilled workers and growing numbers of lower-paid jobs.\u201d\n(Jack Wisniewski contributed to this story.)"},

Larry Hogan, R, spoke at the grand opening Thursday, praising Paragon for \u201clife-changing and life-saving\u201d work he said few companies in the world could match.\n\u201cWe are experiencing an incredible economic resurgence, and one of the highlights is seeing homegrown businesses like Paragon Bioservices continue to invest and expand their footprint right here in our state,\u201d Hogan wrote in a statement.\nParagon was founded by two employees in 1990 as a Johns Hopkins incubator, according to Juliette Bogus, who handles public relations for Paragon. Business incubators are designed to offer resources that will enable new startups to develop quickly.\nMaryland\u2019s local talent and infrastructure have helped Paragon and other early companies seeking capital to grow, said Paragon CEO and President Pete Buzy.\nParagon is directly supported by The More Jobs for Marylanders program \u2014 which gives tax incentives to manufacturing companies \u2014 passed by the state\u2019s legislature in 2017.\nBusinesses like Paragon are success stories and achievements for the state, and show that \u201cMaryland is moving in the right direction\u201d of economic growth, said state Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz.\nIn 2018, Paragon said it had 225 employees at its location in the University of Maryland, Baltimore Biopark, and was expected to almost double its workforce to 400 after construction of its new facility.\nNow, Paragon employs more than 350, and plans to grow to over 500 between its Biopark and Anne Arundel locations by the end of the year.\nWith these kinds of high-paying projects, one hopes the business reaches expectations, but exceeding them is \u201ca really good problem to have,\u201d said Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman.\nThe new facility plans to use living human cells to produce 24 batches of viruses a year that can be injected into patients to correct genetic defects, Philip Wills, chief commercial officer of Paragon, said.\nParagon focuses on gene therapy and producing vaccines, cancer treatments and proteins engineered to fight disease, according to its website.\nThe drugs created will not be personalized, rather they will be able to treat \u201cdozens if not hundreds of patients,\u201d affected by rare diseases and genetic disorders, Wills said.\nIn the state of Maryland, more than 600,000 people are affected by rare diseases, Lydia Seiders, a volunteer ambassador for the Rare Action Network, said.\nWithout \u201caccess to life saving treatment, life-sustaining treatment, and research funding \u2026 we\u2019re going to continue losing patients,\u201d Seiders, a Maryland mother of two children with rare diseases, told Capital News Service.\nResearch funding is a three-step process, starting with diagnosing rare diseases among patients with age, gender, racial or genetic similarities, and then lab testing, before finally allowing patients to take experimental medication or treatments, Seiders said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be directly impacted,\u201d or a part of the rare disease industry, or a politician, to support research into rare diseases, Seiders said.

With this bill, each new electric vehicle purchased will count for $3,000 regardless of battery size.\nWhile plug-in electric and fuel cell vehicles are both currently covered, this tax credit would only apply to fully electric vehicles and would not cover hybrid cars, according to the bill\u2019s lead sponsor, Delegate David Fraser-Hidalgo, D-Montgomery.\nHouse bill 1246, named the Clean Cars Act of 2019, would also increase the maximum price of qualified electric vehicles from $60,000 to $63,000 to adjust for inflation from when the initial limit was set by the Clean Cars Act of 2017, according to Fraser-Hidalgo.\nDue to of a shortage of funding for electric vehicle tax credits in 2017, this legislation is intended to provide enough money to incentivize more Marylanders to purchase zero-emission vehicles, Fraser-Hidalgo said.\nThis bill would allow the Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration to raise the total amount of tax credits to be awarded in total for fiscal year 2020 to $6 million, an increase from the $3 million set aside annually for tax credits by the Clean Cars Act of 2017.\nThe U.S. also offers a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for owning an electric vehicle, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\u201cThat $3,000 tax credit, coupled with the federal $7,500 tax credit\u2026is extremely important to getting the new vehicles in a budget range in which Marylanders can afford,\u201d Fraser-Hidalgo said. \u201cThe electric cars, they\u2019re just better in pretty much every way,\u201d he said.\nA separate Clean Cars Act of 2019\u2013Senate bill 168\u2013was proposed by Gov. Larry Hogan, R, with the primary difference being that Fraser-Hidalgo\u2019s bill would also provide a $1,500 tax credit to people purchasing used electric vehicles, Fraser-Hidalgo said. Senate bill 168 was heard by a Maryland Senate committee Feb. 12.\nWhile Fraser-Hidalgo\u2019s bill would rename the Maryland Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Council to the Maryland Zero Emission Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Council, Hogan\u2019s bill would change the name to the Maryland Zero Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Council. Both measures would focus the organization on promoting fuel cell vehicles. \nIn 2007, Maryland became one of eight states that adopted California\u2019s Zero Emission Vehicles program, according to the Maryland Department of the Environment. Adhering to the standards of the program\u2014later enforced through Maryland legislation in 2011\u2014Maryland must have 60,000 registered zero emission vehicles by 2020 and 300,000 registered by 2025.\nThe number of electric vehicles registered in Maryland doubled between 2017 and 2018. As of February, there are over 18,000 electric vehicles registered in Maryland, according to the Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration.\nMembers of the petroleum industry argued that the tax credits outlined in the Clean Cars Acts disproportionately benefit the wealthy and educated. Mid-Atlantic Petroleum Distributors Association Inc. Executive Vice President Ellen Valentino said this bill and its 2017 predecessor are \u201ctalking to a very narrow segment\u201d of the population.\n\u201cThis has not been a successful program,\u201d Valentino said. \u201cSix million dollars is a lot of money for people shopping for a $63,000 new vehicle,\u201d she told legislators on Tuesday. \nHouse bill 1246 passed through the Maryland House of Delegates March 18 and was heard by a Maryland Senate committee on Tuesday."},

Sen.", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 With student loan debt numbers at a historic level, the Federal Reserve reports that home ownership rates are dropping as a result. \nThe nationwide home ownership rate has dropped noticeably since 2005, particularly among young Americans. In the wake of the financial crisis, overall home ownership in the United States fell from 69 percent in 2005 to 65 percent in 2014, according to the Fed.\nAmong household heads aged 24 to 32, the rate fell more steeply, from 45 percent in 2005 to 36 percent in 2014.\nWhile home ownership numbers have fallen, student debt has spiked. Outstanding student loans have ballooned to roughly $1.5 trillion, while the average student loan debt per capita among 24-to-32-year-olds has doubled since 2005, rising from roughly $5,000 to $10,000 in 2014, according to the Fed\u2019s Jan. 16 report.\nWith young people spending more money on outstanding student loan debt, the burden of buying a home has become even more difficult.\n\u201cWe estimate that roughly 20 percent of the decline in home ownership among young adults can be attributed to their increased student loan debts since 2005,\u201d said report authors Alvaro Mezza, Daniel Ringo, and Kamila Sommer of the Federal Reserve.\nIn other words, over 400,000 people would have \u2013 or at least could have \u2013 purchased a home if not for the increase in student loan debt. The study showed that a $1,000 increase in student loan debt for a college-age person yields a 1 to 2 percent drop in their likelihood of owning a home from age 24 to 32.\nMaryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen is one of several Democratic lawmakers to speak out against continually rising student loan debt, which now ranks as the second largest debt category among Americans (behind mortgage debt), according to Forbes.\n\u201cStudent loans impair their financial mobility \u2014 often preventing them from buying a home or putting away savings,\u201d Van Hollen, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, told the Capital News Service in a statement.\nIn addition to being a vacuum for some graduates\u2019 savings accounts, student loan debt can put a hamper on credit scores, an essential tool in buying a home.\n\u201cIncreased student loan debt causes borrowers to be more likely to default on their student loan debt, which has a major adverse effect on their credit scores, thereby impacting their ability to qualify for a mortgage,\u201d the Fed report said. \nAside from home ownership, a weak credit score stemming from student loan debt affects one\u2019s access to auto loans and credit cards as well.\n\u201cWe must address this growing problem,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I support efforts to allow students to refinance their loans to lower rates, improve implementation of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and increase the Pell grant to cover more college costs.\u201d\nRefinancing loans and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program are two popular avenues to lower student loan debt after graduation, while the Pell Grants are given to needy undergraduate students and almost never requires a repayment. \nAll three options are currently in place, but with the debt total continuing to rise, Van Hollen and other Democrats are looking for changes.\nOf course, the benefits of a college education are essential to the relationship between student loan debt and the potential for higher salaries after graduation.\nThose who receive a form of higher education still experience higher earnings and lower rates of unemployment, on average, according to multiple reports. \nHowever, with the increasing burden of student loan debt, the benefits of secondary education might be losing their impact, the Fed warned."},

The food bank has also experienced an increase in need from individuals who suffer from diabetes and obesity, Del Guercio said. \nJoanna Warner, the director of communications for the Maryland Food Bank, said that despite the stigma associated with relying on food banks, there is a wide range of people the Food Bank serves.\n\u201cWhat we say is that a lot of the individuals that we serve, they just had one unexpected event in their life that suddenly created all sorts of chaos,\u201d said Warner. \u201cI mean they lost a job or they had some medical condition unexpectedly.

The 29-year-old\u2019s jersey has been the most sold in the league for the past two seasons, according to the NBA.\nUnder Armour\u2019s recent losses could be attributed to concerns about Curry re-signing with the company when his contract expires in 2024, Johns Hopkins University economics professor Ricard Gil said. The prospect of Curry leaving the sports apparel company without a marketable basketball star could be scaring some investors, Gil said.\nThe most basic shoe, which officially debuts for the general public on Friday, will retail for $130 in a black and white color scheme. Under Armour is also lowering the price after his last shoe retailed for $140.\nCurry first wore the \u201c4\u2019s\u201d during the Warriors\u2019 victory in game three of the 2017 NBA Finals. He has sported various styles of the shoe in the months since the championship.\nSales begin Friday morning once stores open across the nation, and stores are recommending that customers arrive by opening hours that first day if they want to ensure that their size is in stock.

Curry could potentially revolutionize Under Armour in the same way that Jordan helped Nike\u2019s business boom, Semmelhack said.\nSince then, over 30 unique Air Jordan designs have been released. The Jordan sneaker brand had an estimated $3 billion in sales in 2015 and it was estimated that Jordan sneakers accounted for 8 percent of Nike\u2019s total revenue that year, according to Forbes.\nWith an improved product, the new shoes could boost sales domestically, but also in China, where Curry is beloved. Curry is the second-most popular NBA player in China, behind only Kobe Bryant, according to Mailman, a digital sports marketing company in China.\nThis summer was the third straight time that Curry has taken a trip to China with Under Armour. Even a colorway of his latest shoe, the \u201cMore Magic,\u201d is inspired by The Bund in Shanghai.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a 1.5 billion-person market ready for them,\u201d Gil said. \u201cCurry is beloved there, so of course China represents an opportunity for Under Armour.\u201d\nUnder Armour, which began as an apparel company, only released their first running sneaker in 2008. They began making basketball shoes shortly after signing Brandon Jennings that year to be the first face of their basketball division.\nCompanies like Nike and Adidas had decades of experience before Under Armour even began crafting footwear, so the fact that Under Armour is even in the conversation with those companies is flattering to them, said Geller.\n\u201cNike has has 45 years of hits and instant sell outs,\u201d Geller said. \u201cNike can just release retro models and people will buy them. Under Armour doesn\u2019t have any of that.\u201d\nWhile some shoe experts are doubtful that there is a future where Under Armour overtakes Nike in the basketball sneaker industry, some business professors aren\u2019t counting out Under Armour.\n\u201cI can remember back when Puma and Adidas dominated footwear, so there\u2019s always an opportunity,\u201d Peter Lorenzi, management professor at Loyola University-Maryland said. \u201cThere is certainly room for change within the leisure and sports apparel industry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTwitter users react to Curry\u2019s sneakers\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nSteph is selling a PT Cruiser for your feet pic.twitter.com/QCfaTeB47W\n\u2014 Zach Harper (@talkhoops) April 9, 2017\n\n\nThe life alert 3\u2019s @casspa pic.twitter.com/MtHo1COfTu\n\u2014 Bryan Panzero (@ImBadLuckBryan) June 10, 2016\n\n\nthe La-Z-Boy 7s pic.twitter.com/HgS8rtpprS\n\u2014 POC with degrees??

Bush administration, said that it\u2019s misleading to only look at the state and local deduction (known as SALT) without considering the other parts of the GOP tax plan.\n\u201cThey are looking at the SALT deduction in isolation and ignoring the accompanying increased standard deduction, which ameliorates for most non-high-income families,\u201d Swagel said.\nSwagel said that the value of deducting state and local taxes is lower for families with average or lower income. Each dollar of that deduction is more valuable in higher income brackets, he said.\nThe deductions do benefit some middle class families in the state, but the extent of the benefit may not be as drastic as Van Hollen is making it out to be, Swagel said.\nBut some Republicans representing states with high taxes are signaling their discomfort over eliminating the state and local tax deduction, according to news reports. Those lawmakers have said they may not back a House budget resolution if the tax plan includes ending that deduction."},

Meanwhile, the Seahawks and Ravens took advantage of important players on cheap rookie deals, and the Broncos emphasized the passing game on both ends of the ball.\nHere\u2019s how each of the past six Super Bowl champions managed their salary caps, measured by the percentage they spent on each position.\n2016 New England Patriots\n\nCapital News Service Graphic by Ana Hurler and Daniel Chavkin\nThe Patriots clear objective in 2016 was building around quarterback Tom Brady, giving him both weapons and protection. In some cases, New England didn\u2019t have to pay much to players on rookie contracts. But other players whose rookie deals expired needed raises.\nOffensively, New England spent money on skill positions to help Brady. Tight ends Rob Gronkowski and Martellus Bennett each took up between 3.5 and 4.5 percent of cap space, and wide receivers Chris Hogan, Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman cost 8.66 percent in total. Additionally, Nate Solder and Marcus Cannon combined for over 11 percent of cap room, more than any other pair of starting offensive tackles among these Super Bowl winners.\nDefensively, New England focused on outside linebackers over inside linebackers, employing seven of the former and two of the latter. Dont\u2019a Hightower, who led all linebackers with 5.25 percent of the cap and was listed as an outside linebacker, was versatile enough to play both inside and outside when necessary. In the secondary, cornerbacks Malcolm Butler and Logan Ryan\u2019s cheap first contract allowed New England to focus on paying safeties, mainly Devin McCourty. Finally, kicker Stephen Gostkowski in 2016 was the most expensive specialist among the 18 measured.\n2015 Denver Broncos\n\nCapital News Service Graphic by Ana Hurler and Daniel Chavkin\nOf the last six Super Bowl teams, the Broncos acquired more of their top contributors through free agency. Denver emphasized passing \u2014 both on offense and defense \u2014 instead of the running game.\nWhile ineffective for the majority of the season, QB Peyton Manning still took up the most cap space. At 12.06 percent, he was the most expensive player on the last six Super Bowl winning teams. While OT Ryan Clady didn\u2019t play a game due to injury, he still occupied 7.31 percent of cap space, meaning Denver only spent about 2 percent of its cap on tackles who actually played in 2015. The Broncos wide receivers combined to form the most expensive offensive position on this list, mainly due to Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders\u2019 combined 13.13 percent in cap space.\nDefensively, the Broncos were able to pay talented players in its back seven, because CB Chris Harris\u2019 $42 million contract extension did not kick in until 2016. Safety T.J. Ward, CB Aqib Talib and OLB Demarcus Ware joined the team in the 2014 offseason, combining for about 16 percent of the team\u2019s cap. Due to the expensive back seven, Denver had to trust cheap talent on the defensive line like Malik Jackson and Derek Wolfe, which ultimately paid off.\n2014 New England Patriots\n\nCapital News Service Graphic by Ana Hurler and Daniel Chavkin\nThe biggest difference between the 2014 and 2016 Patriots was their secondary, because they spent more on players to help on the outside.\nIn 2014, New England paid expensive one-year contracts to cornerbacks Darrelle Revis and Brandon Browner in free agency, for 7.23 percent of the cap. New England had room to do that, because it was the year before McCourty hit free agency and signed a big extension and Butler was a rookie. DT Vince Wilfork\u2019s presence was also key, as his 5.63 percent cap hit on the defensive line in his last year with the team. In 2014, Hightower was listed as an inside linebacker.\nOn offense, OG Dan Connolly\u2019s 3.04 percent cap hit was a significant factor. The veteran retired after winning the Super Bowl and New England didn\u2019t spend cap room trying to replace him, opting for cheap alternatives and draft picks when they won in 2016. OT Nate Solder was about 5 percent cheaper this year than in 2016, after signing a two-year, $20 million extension in 2015.\n2013 Seattle Seahawks\n\nCapital News Service Graphic by Ana Hurler and Daniel Chavkin\nMore than any other recent Super Bowl winner, the Seahawks had the luxury of having their best players on cheap deals. They had a balanced offensive cap allocation, while defense was mainly spent on one position.\nSeattle benefitted from a cheap quarterback in 2013, with Russell Wilson on the second year of his third-round-pick rookie deal. The team used this money in part to pay RB Marshawn Lynch, its most important offensive player. At 6.36 percent of the cap, Lynch was the highest-paid running back on recent Super Bowl winners.The Seahawks were also the only team to have paid three offensive tackles at least 2.5 percent of cap space, led by Russell Okung\u2019s 7.13 percent. Their highest paid player was TE Zach Miller, at 8.32 percent.\nThe Seahawks\u2019 defensive ends were the most expensive of any position in this analysis. While they only had four, each player had a cap hit of at least 2.8 percent and two took up more than 5.5 percent of space. Seattle benefitted from cheap rookie deals in the secondary, with stars like CB Richard Sherman and safeties Kam Chancellor and Earl Thomas. Of Seattle\u2019s four cornerbacks, none had a cap hit over 0.6 percent.\n2012 Baltimore Ravens\n\nCapital News Service Graphic by Ana Hurler and Daniel Chavkin\nBaltimore had a much more lopsided cap allocation than other recent Super Bowl champions. The Ravens spent much more on defense than on offensive players.\nSince QB Joe Flacco didn\u2019t sign his massive extension until after the season, he only cost 6.05 percent of the cap, giving Baltimore some flexibility. The Ravens\u2019 only expensive players were RB Ray Rice, FB Vonta Leach and WR Anquan Boldin, combining for 12.76 percent. Leach was by far the most expensive fullback in this analysis. Baltimore also had the cheapest offensive line of the six teams, as OT Bryant McKinnie and OG Marshal Yanda were the only players with a cap hit over 2 percent.\nOn defense, the Ravens used most of their cap on important veteran pieces. OLB Terrell Suggs, S Ed Reed and DT Haloti Ngata were the team\u2019s three most expensive players, with a combined cap hit of 23.83 percent. After Reed, Baltimore\u2019s secondary was relatively cheap. The highest cap hit among the 12 remaining players was 1.98 percent.\n2011 New York Giants\n\nCapital News Service Graphic by Ana Hurler and Daniel Chavkin\nThe Giants were the only team to prioritize the running game more than the passing game offensively. And, similar to Seattle and New England in 2016, they took advantage of rookie contracts in the secondary.\nWhile QB Eli Manning led the team in cap percentage, the Giants also employed the most expensive backup quarterback; Sage Rosenfels cost 2.92 percent of the cap. New York was also the only team to spend more on running backs than wide receivers, as Brandon Jacobs and Ahmad Bradshaw cost over 8 percent of the cap. Meanwhile, Mario Manningham and Hakeem Nicks only combined for a 1.31 percent cap hit, the only wide receivers above 1 percent on the team and by far the lowest percentage among a team\u2019s highest paid receivers.\nDefensively, the Giants Super Bowl team was known for its pass rushing defensive ends, and it showed in their cap. Defensive ends Chris Canty, Justin Tuck and Jason Pierre-Paul combined for 14.31 percent of the cap, and that doesn\u2019t include Osi Umenyiora who was listed as an outside linebacker. Finally, CB Corey Webster and S Antrel Rolle cost 8.29 of the secondary\u2019s 14.31 percent cap hit."},

MEILS and SEBASTIAN OBANDO\nFREDERICK, Maryland \u2014 Before he got involved in the beer business, Frederick County farmer Greg Clabaugh grossed about $600 an acre for growing traditional crops like corn and soybeans.\nNow, on the land where he grows barley and rye, he grosses $6,000 an acre.\nIncluded in that number is payment for malting, a process where grains are partially germinated then heat-dried, allowing them to be more easily consumed by yeast in the brewing or distilling process.\n\u201cYou gotta put the time in,\u201d said Clabaugh, about learning to malt. \u201cWe started at the bottom and worked our way up. Now I have requests from all over.\u201d\nClabaugh\u2019s partner in his malting operation is Tom Flores, brewmaster for Monacacy Brewing and Brewer\u2019s Alley, both located in the city of Frederick. Clabaugh and Flores are the very portrait of what counties like Frederick are trying to do economically \u2014 find synergies between traditional agricultural interests and newer down-county businesses, including tech, tourism and a booming food and booze scene in the city of Frederick.\nUnlike Western Maryland and Eastern Shore counties, which are starved for growth, Harford, Carroll and Frederick are trying to ensure their farming heritage doesn\u2019t become a casualty of their recent economic success and decades-long population growth. A legacy industry in particular jeopardy is dairy farming, which is suffering acutely from a steep drop in the market price for raw milk.\nCan Maryland\u2019s northern counties thread the needle between the older and newer parts of their economies? It\u2019s not clear. But if they\u2019re successful, they could show other rural areas how to lean less on farming without forsaking it altogether.\nThe gift of geography is not a gift for all\nFrom 1960 to 2010, the counties of Frederick, Carroll and Harford each experienced more than 200 percent population growth, most of it down-county, in commuting distance to either Washington, D.C., Baltimore or both. The demographic explosion was the result of a range of factors, from the construction of I-270 to Frederick in the 1970s to the steady bedrooming of Carroll and Harford by commuters looking for cheaper real estate and a better quality of life.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the precipice of being a full-fledged suburban county,\u201d said County Executive Barry Glassman, R-Harford. \u201cWe\u2019re down to four or five dairy farms.\u201d\nThe effects of the demographic shift over the past few decades hit traditional farming businesses hard, both in land swallowed for real estate development and increases in agricultural production costs.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2012, Harford lost 30 percent of its farmland. In Frederick, the decrease was 15 percent in the same span.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t compete with a developer selling $500,000 homes because they can spend a lot more on land,\u201d said Colby Ferguson, director of government relations from the Maryland Farm Bureau.\nWhere farms disappeared, commuters filled in, bringing their urban paychecks to fast-developing rural areas. The city of Frederick, now the second-largest in Maryland at about 70,000 people, was a big economic driver and diversifier.\nThe counties of Harford and Frederick also benefit from an enviable bit of stable government largesse \u2014 their biggest single employers are both military. Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Harford employs 21,000 and Fort Detrick in Frederick is responsible for 6,400 jobs, according the Maryland Department of Commerce.\nBeyond direct employment, the ancillary economic benefits of the bases are enormous.\nFort Detrick is home to a range of research labs, military medical operations and biodefense efforts. A small cottage industry of private biomedical support firms and services has grown in the area as a result.\nThough not directly related, a tech community has also been steadily expanding in Frederick, led by companies like Yakabod and Swift Systems that focus on IT and networking solutions for government and private clients.\nHowever, like Fort Detrick and Aberdeen Proving Grounds, the tech sector in Frederick is located in the county\u2019s southern end, reinforcing the economic divide and maintaining pressure on dwindling agricultural lands to the north.\n\u201cWith more people coming to Frederick County, it makes our land prices go up,\u201d said Katie Albaugh, agriculture business development specialist for Frederick County. \u201cSo farmers, with the low grain prices, need to farm more ground to make a living, but they can\u2019t afford to buy the land because the price has gone up.\u201d\nThe challenge might be preventing one area from swallowing the other.\n\u201cI think that the two can co-exist,\u201d said County Executive Jan Gardner, D-Frederick. \u201cBut we really need to focus our growth around urban areas.\u201d\nIn Frederick anyway, political forces seem to be aligned in this regard.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep our development south of I-70,\u201d said County Councilman Bud Otis, R-Frederick. \u201cIf something is going to jump that line, it\u2019s going to have to be something pretty special.\u201d\nOne thing that might protect northern agricultural lands is the sheer cost of infrastructure needed to support down-county development.\nWhile new residential and commercial properties eat up capital improvement budget dollars for water and sewer expansion as well as for transportation and school projects, they tend keep developers eyes to the south, where it\u2019s easier to build.\nThe end of dairy in Maryland?\nFrederick was once one of the largest milk-producing counties in the country. Soon, it could be one of the smallest.\nAccording to Maryland Dairy Industry Oversight and Advisory Council, there are about *88 dairy farms in Frederick, a drop from previous years.\n\u201cFamily dairy farming in Maryland is done,\u201d said Clabaugh. \u201cNowadays, you need to have a couple hundred cows\u201d just to be profitable, a reality that is driving some smaller farms out of business.\nCows at the trough on a farm in Walkersville, Maryland. Milk prices have rebounded slightly from a low in 2016, but are still making life difficult for Maryland\u2019s dairy farmers. (Photo by J.F. Meils/Capital News Service)\nThe decline of the dairy business in Frederick reflects a brutal economic climate that combines depressed milk prices with rising operating expenses \u2014 a mix that has eroded profits and pushed more farmers into financial turmoil.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle anyone\u2019s milking cows because you don\u2019t know what (price) you\u2019re getting from moment to moment,\u201d said Jimmy Stup, whose dairy farm in Walkersville includes more than 1,000 milk cows.\nMilk prices received by Maryland farmers reached a high of $26 per 100 pounds in the spring of 2014 then began a rapid decent, hitting a low of $15.30 per 100 pounds in May 2016, according to Maryland Dairy Industry Oversight and Advisory Council. Prices have risen somewhat and are now above $17 per 100 pounds.\n\u201cMaryland has lost a number of dairy farms largely due to these low milk prices,\u201d\nsaid Laurie Savage, spokeswoman of the Maryland Dairy Industry Association.\nBut it\u2019s not just price that\u2019s driving dairy farmers out of business.\n\u201cPrimarily, there is just too much milk and not enough demand,\u201d said Mark Powell, chief of marketing at the Maryland Department of Agriculture. \u201cIn the United States, fluid milk consumption continues to go down.\u201d\nGlobal politics have also played a role. After Russia banned European Union dairy products in August 2014, a glut of milk flooded the continent, reducing U.S. dairy exports and driving down prices worldwide.\nJimmy Stup on his farm in Walkersville, Maryland. \u201cThe cost of everything goes up,\u201d said Stup. \u201cBut the price we get from milk doesn\u2019t go up as much. That\u2019s where the squeeze comes in.\u201d (Photo by J.F. Meils/Capital News Service)\nWhile these developments have hit dairy operations across the country, economists say Maryland farmers are at a greater disadvantage because other costs, like land and labor, which are more expensive because of the state\u2019s proximity to large population centers in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, which are encroaching on rural areas.\nData from the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture show that the cost of running a farm in Maryland is higher than in most other Mid-Atlantic states, although costs are lower than average in Frederick. Average farm production expenditures in 2012 were $158,300 in Maryland compared to $127,600 in New York and $101,900 in Pennsylvania.\nThe high cost of farming in Maryland may explain why big farms are buying up smaller ones \u2014 because they\u2019re better able to withstand the bad times.\n\u201cWhile the (number of) dairy farms may be getting smaller, the number of milk cows might be staying the same because the remaining dairy farms are larger,\u201d said Jim Hanson, a professor in the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of Maryland.\nThe total amount of annual milk production in Maryland has fallen over the past three decades, but has remained relatively stable in the past six years at more than 900 million pounds, even though gross income has dropped sharply.\nMyersville farmer Joe Mangiafico in his cow barn. \u201cFarming is not as simple as it was 30 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t see myself doing anything else.\u201d (Photo by J.F. Meils/Capital News Service)\n\u201cWe\u2019re not getting rich,\u201d said Myersville farmer Joe Mangiafico. \u201cWe\u2019re making enough to keep going. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not a struggle.\u201d\nCan beer, tech and tourism save ag?\nThe partnership between Greg Clabaugh and Tom Flores happened because Clabaugh picked up the spent grain Flores used for brewing to feed to his dairy cows.\nOne day, they got to talking.\n\u201cI asked him: \u2018Can you grow barley?\u2019\u201d recalled Flores. \u201c(Clabaugh) said: \u2018If there\u2019s anything I can grow, it\u2019s barley,\u2019 and we just sort of went from there.\u201d\nThe result was Amber Fields Malting and Brewing, a company that Flores believes can be emulated successfully in Maryland.\n\u201cA lot of Maryland farmers know how to cultivate land for small grains,\u201d said Flores, who is almost exclusively malting rye with Clabaugh at the moment, for Monacacy\u2019s Riot Rye Pale Ale.\nFarmer Greg Clabaugh explains how to malt grains for brewing at his farm in Keymar, Maryland. (Photo by J.F. Meils/Capital News Service)\nPrices for malted grains run anywhere between about 40 cents to $1 a pound, according to Flores. And it takes a lot of malt to make beer, about 350 pounds to make 14 kegs of a lighter beer and upwards of 450 pounds for 14 kegs of an IPA-style brew.\nAs expected, Flores is a big proponent of keeping his ingredients as local as possible. Despite producing one of the first beers in almost a century to be made 100 percent from ingredients produced in Frederick, he is no zealot.\n\u201cLocal for the sake of local alone is not a good enough reason to pursue it. You need to start with high quality,\u201d he said.\nFor Monica Pearce, who opened Tenth Ward Distilling with Kyle Pfalzer in 2016, the benefits of local are two-fold. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to me to limit the impact we have on the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other side is having your products influenced by local flavor.\u201d\nA third benefit might be attracting tourists.\nAccording to Helen Propheter, Frederick County\u2019s head of economic development, the county earned the equivalent of $1 million a day in tourist revenue starting in 2014.\nA big part of that draw is the city of Frederick, its restaurants and, yes, its breweries and distilleries, which the county now promotes with a dedicated tour map.\n\u201cPeople are starting to ask where their whiskey comes from,\u201d said Pearce. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have done that 10 years ago.\u201d\nFrederick\u2019s food, drink and historic vibe have combined to create something intangible but crucial for the entire county \u2014 a scene. And getting in on that scene is agriculture, which is drawing tourists who come to the city of Frederick up county for its orchards, produce markets and creameries.\nThe Carroll Creek area in the city of Frederick was devastated by a flood in 1976, but rebuilt to be the center of the city\u2019s historic quarter and a popular attraction for visiting tourists and locals alike. (Photo by J.F. Meils/Capital News Service)\nEven Frederick\u2019s tech community stands to benefit, if they can just get the word out.\n\u201c(Newcomers to Frederick) want to live here for quality of life and affordable housing,\u201d said Vaughn Thurman, founder of Swift Software and Swift Systems, which is located in Frederick and does IT support and workflow software. \u201cBut they don\u2019t realize they should live here in order to work here.\u201d\nScott Ryser, CEO of Yakabod, a collaborative software company that is one of Frederick\u2019s first tech denizens, said he wants to put a billboard on I-270 south that tells people they\u2019re driving in the wrong direction.\n\u201cI walk to work,\u201d said Ryser. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t do this 20 years ago.\u201d\n*An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that there are approximately 400 dairy farms in Frederick County.

The service remains profitable but has seen a decline in users as more content becomes available through streaming.", "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Netflix is the undisputed king of streaming. Globally, 93.8 million people subscribe to the streaming service \u2014 nearly 50 percent more than their closest competitor Amazon Prime, with more than 66 million subscribers, according to Recode.\nNetflix got its start by toppling DVD Goliath Blockbuster Video, delivering DVDs to customers homes and eliminating late fees. And though the antiquated disc-by-mail service is dwindling, more than 4 million subscribers still use it. Amy Snurr, of Westminster, Maryland, is one of those subscribers.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do Netflix DVDs as much as we used to with Redbox around but we still enjoy it,\u201d Snurr wrote in an email. She has been a subscriber since 2009, but only added the streaming service last year.\nWillie Carr had a similar experience with the streaming service.\n\u201cStreaming is actually what I do most, I haven\u2019t used the disc service in actually quite a while; probably a couple years,\u201d the Waldorf, Maryland resident said.\nCarr has been a member for about seven years, but will probably end the DVD service soon, he said.\n\u201cAlmost anything you want to watch nowadays is available via [streaming],\u201d he said. \u201cThe last thing that I used it for was The Big Bang Theory.\u201d\nNetflix DVD subscribers are dwindling, but Netflix still manages to make 50 cents in profit for every dollar they put into the service. Despite this, their net profit has nearly been cut in half since 2011.\n\nAmanda Lotz, a media scholar and professor at the University of Michigan, attributes the continued success of Netflix DVDs to film enthusiasts and the established infrastructure the company has built.\n\u201cI can only guess, but the infrastructure is built, and as subscribers have decreased they\u2019ve likely decreased the number of DVDs purchased so that their costs have decreased along with revenue,\u201d Lotz wrote in an email. \u201cIt is worth maintaining as long as it is profitable, even if it isn\u2019t the company\u2019s core business anymore.\u201d\nSince Netflix split into two separate services in 2011, streaming has been their main focus. Global streaming subscribers have increased an average of 13.48 million each year.\nLotz credits Netflix\u2019s international success partially to the first-mover advantage. Because Netflix was one of the first to heavily invest in streaming, they were able to capitalize on an untapped market.\nMoreover, Netflix was launched in the U.S., a large and lucrative market, Lotz said. This gives Netflix an edge over companies that have launched in smaller countries with less buying power.\nCurrent trends for Netflix will likely continue \u2014 DVD subscribers will fall, streaming subscribers will rise, and the company will expand. Maybe one day Netflix DVD subscribers will finally hit zero, but for the time being, they\u2019re still holding on, 4 million strong."},

In the last decade, the surroundings have transformed from high crime to high rise.\nIn 2003, The Washington Post reported so many rocks were thrown at Metro buses in Southeast Washington that bus drivers were instructed to wear safety goggles while navigating the area.\nNow, the only flying objects bus drivers have to fear are home runs.\nThe turnaround began when the Montreal Expos moved from Quebec to the nation\u2019s capital in 2005, changing their name to the Nationals and bringing baseball back to Washington after a 33-year hiatus.\nOne of the first to bet on the neighborhood was Justin Ross, owner of Justin\u2019s Cafe and The Big Stick, two restaurants near the ballpark.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Justin\u2019s Cafe on First Street SE is near Nationals Stadium. Owner Justin Ross has another restaurant in the area, closer to the stadium. (Tom Hausman/Capital News Service)\nRoss opened his cafe in 2010. He said he remembered there wasn\u2019t much else around at the time. Seven years later, large pockets of apartment complexes, condos and restaurants have sprouted up, and men in hard hats fill the remaining open spaces.\nIt wouldn\u2019t have happened without the Nationals, Ross said.\n\u201cThe Nats are the anchor to this whole thing,\u201d he explained.\nThe revitalization the Nationals sparked in the Navy Yard neighborhood is just one example of what relocation and expansion franchises can do for their new homes.\nConsider the impact of a relocated team about 40 miles north of Nationals Park in Maryland\u2019s biggest city.\nOn March 28, 1984, the city of Baltimore was thunderstruck when Baltimore Colts owner Bob Irsay moved the team to Indianapolis in the middle of the night, ripping the heart out of the industrial city.\n\u201cI think the city\u2019s self-image suffered,\u201d said Tom Kelso, chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority and a former Baltimore Colts fan. \u201cWe still had the Orioles, but that was the only professional team we had left. It was a very concerning and demoralizing time.\u201d\nFor 12 years, Baltimore was nearly without football, except for the Canadian Football League\u2019s Baltimore Stallions in 1994 and 1995. Then Art Modell moved his Cleveland Browns to the Charm City in 1996, restarting the once-strong NFL football culture with the Ravens.\nIn 2006, the Maryland Stadium Authority commissioned a study on the monetary value of the Ravens and the stadium built for them, M&T Bank Stadium.\nThe study found the stadium was worth almost $10 million a year in taxes and $216 million in economic activity. In 2007, the Ravens\u2019 payroll alone generated $15.5 million in taxes and $68.8 million in economic activity in the city, all because the players lived in the city at least during the season.\nKelso believes that impact wouldn\u2019t be felt if the stadium had been built in the suburbs, as some pushed for in the mid-1990s.\n\u201c(It) would never have taken place if those stadiums had been located out in the suburbs where people come, they park their car, they walk in the stadium, and when the event is over they get in their car and they leave,\u201d he said.\nNot only has M&T Bank Stadium brought people into downtown Baltimore, it has become a greeting for the city. It sits next to Orioles Park at Camden Yards, which opened in 1992 and started the area revival, and together they act as a welcome mat for drivers approaching the city from the south on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. What used to be an abandoned rail yard with crumbling factories is now one of the city\u2019s proudest fixtures, a microcosm of what Kelso believes is the team\u2019s largest contribution to Baltimore.\n\u201cThe biggest impact is the psychological impact,\u201d Kelso said. \u201cWe identify with the Ravens, and Baltimore is identified to a certain degree by the Ravens. I think it has had a tremendous impact on the way that people outside of Baltimore perceive us.\u201d\nNew teams can bring new life to all areas \u2013 even outside of the United States.\nWhen the first iteration of the Winnipeg Jets departed in 1996, the city was crushed, much like Baltimore was 12 years earlier.\n\u201cWhen the Jets left, it was a real kick in the gut to the city,\u201d said Chuck Davidson, president and CEO of the Manitoba Chamber of Commerce and 25-year Winnipeg resident. \u201cIt took a lot of what some would say the heart out of the city at the time. It took this community a long time to recover.\u201d\nThe first major step in bringing the NHL back to Winnipeg was the construction in 2004 of the MTS Centre downtown, a hopeful home for an NHL franchise in the future. Previously, an empty multi-story retail building occupied the space and was considered an eyesore on Winnipeg\u2019s major street, Portage Avenue.\nThe Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League resided in the arena, which helped the downtown area some, Davidson said. While the Moose were bringing several thousand people to the area each game, their family-friendly atmosphere that catered to children was never going to do enough to completely change the face of the city\u2019s downtown, according to Davidson. But it did enough to help achieve the ultimate goal.\nIn 2011, the Atlanta Thrashers traveled north to their new home to become the second edition of the Winnipeg Jets. The city celebrated in a way it hadn\u2019t in more than a decade.\n\u201cWhen it was announced that the Jets were coming back, young people shut down Portage and Main (Street) to play road hockey,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cIt was all courted off and it was the coolest thing.\u201d\nFinally, Winnipeggers had their team back, and with that the sense of pride they lost in 1996.\n\u201cIt makes us feel like, you know what, we\u2019re back in the NHL and we\u2019re the same level as the Torontos and the LAs and the New Yorks, and that wasn\u2019t something we could say prior to the Winnipeg Jets being here,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cIt allows people in Winnipeg to stand out their chest a little bit, and I think it\u2019s really increased pride in our community.\u201d\nThe Jets have brought more people to downtown and new businesses and housing options have grown in kind.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Apartment buildings and construction seen at the intersection of N and Half Streets SW near Nationals Stadium. The area around the stadium has seen an increase in construction after the Nationals moved to Washington in 2005. (Tom Hausman/Capital News Service)\nJon Dueck, the general manager of Shark Club Winnipeg, said the restaurant chain wouldn\u2019t have opened its location next to the MTS Centre when it did four years ago if not for the Jets.\n\u201cOur busiest nights are Jets nights,\u201d Dueck said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s a Saturday, a Friday, a Tuesday, a Monday, we see a huge increase. We pretty much have 10 times the amount of staff those nights than for non-Jets nights. If you don\u2019t get here with two hours to spare (before puck drop), you won\u2019t find a table.\u201d\nDueck\u2019s example provides insight into the renaissance of downtown Winnipeg.\nJust 10 years ago, you could have walked along Portage Avenue and been faced with boarded up windows and a desolate downtown. Now, office buildings and condos line the way to the MTS Centre with fans in Jets jerseys populating the sidewalk, a token of gratitude for the revitalization.\n\u201cOur economy, there\u2019s no question it\u2019s benefited,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen a population increase within the city of Winnipeg substantially over the last number of years. There\u2019s a clear correlation.\u201d\nWith a diverse economic base and a growing immigrant communities, Winnipeg added more than 40,000 residents between 2011 to 2015, taking the total population past 700,000, according to the city of Winnipeg\u2019s statistics. The city is projected to reach 1 million people by 2033.\nOld and new Winnipeggers have gotten to enjoy the same satisfaction as Baltimoreans and Washingtonians in welcoming back a team, giving each of the cities a reason to hold their heads high.\n\u201cIt\u2019s given us our swagger back,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cWe are a major league city again.\u201d\nThere are other success stories, too. Indianapolis was known as \u201cNap Town\u201d in the 1960s, and now through its sports teams and a downtown revitalization that the Los Angeles Times called \u201cbreathtaking,\u201d the city is thriving.\nIn 2015, Oklahoma City government said each home game of the NBA\u2019s Thunder generated a direct economic impact of $1.5 million for the city.\nThe Greater Memphis Chamber commissioned a study in 2010 on the economic impact of the NBA Grizzlies that found the team generated more than $223 million annually for Shelby County and created 1,534 jobs.\nBut that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean tax dollars to pay for stadiums and amenities is the right way for cities to go. A 2014 study by the University of Kentucky recommended cities use economic development as a reason for forking over cash to teams. But, it noted that if lawmakers do offer public funding, it \u201cshould be for social reasons such as maintaining quality of life or civic pride.\u201d\nMany economists, however, insist professional sports teams are insignificant in overall urban economies.\n\u201cThere is no impact,\u201d Temple University sports economist Michael Leeds told Marketplace in 2015. \u201cIf every sports team in Chicago were to suddenly disappear, the impact on the Chicago economy would be a fraction of 1 percent.\u201d\nBut Ross believes the Navy Yard neighborhood wouldn\u2019t be what it is today without the Nationals residing in the area\u2019s most recognizable building.\n\u201cIf they weren\u2019t here, I don\u2019t think this would be happening,\u201d Ross said."},
