The Giants were disappointed to lose him, while Washington hopes he will help improve their struggling team's performance.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Washington\u2019s NFL team recently made a big move in free agency, signing safety Landon Collins to a six-year, $84 million contract.\nCollins, 25, had already made the Pro Bowl three times and was a member of the AP All-Pro team in 2016, all with the New York Giants, a division rival.\n\u201cThat organization is awesome,\u201d Collins said in an interview with NFL Network about his former team. \u201cHonestly I love them. I respect them, they gave me my first opportunity to play in the NFL, they took a chance on my and hopefully they love the four years I gave them.\n\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future holds with the New York Giants but I\u2019m glad it happened because now I\u2019m in that burgundy and gold.\u201d\nThe Giants decided not to give Collins a big contract, but ownership was still disappointed to lose him.\n\u201cThat hurt me greatly,\u201d John Mara, the president and co-owner of the Giants, said at the 2019 NFL owners\u2019 meetings in Phoenix. \u201cI liked Landon a lot, and I had a great deal of respect for him. He played hard week in and week out.\u201d\nThe Washington franchise hopes Collins can be among the off-season upgrades that will get the struggling team back into the playoffs.\nCollins has been widely regarded in football, going back to his high school days. He was a 5-star recruit going into college after starring in football and as a sprinter at Dutchtown High School in Louisiana.\nAfter high school, he made the decision to attend the University of Alabama over Louisiana State University live on ESPN \u2013 to the dismay of his mother, who sat next to him, shook her head and said she still supported LSU.\nCollins backed that decision up by helping Alabama win the national title his freshman season.\nAfter three seasons at Alabama, Collins declared for the NFL draft and was selected by the Giants with the first pick of the second round.\nAnalyst Lance Zierlein called Collins a \u201cwrap-up tackler. Physical enough to match up against tight ends and has the feet to carry big, slot targets,\u201d but went on to criticize Collins\u2019 ability to cover receivers and tight ends. Those continue to be the biggest knocks on Collins.\nDespite his success in the NFL, he still has had issues in coverage.\nHe switched from his natural position \u2013 strong safety \u2013 to free safety during his rookie season due to injuries suffered by other defensive backs. Collins struggled in coverage at free safety but did have an interception and more than 100 tackles.\nCollins moved back to strong safety in 2016 and broke out with five interceptions and four sacks. He also played well in the Giants\u2019 playoff loss that season, coming up with a sack and six tackles.\nThe Giants failed to make the playoffs over the past two seasons and Collins missed five games due to a broken forearm in 2017 and a torn rotator cuff in 2018.\n(new graf) Despite the injuries, he made the Pro Bowl both seasons. He is not expected to miss any time next season because of the rotator cuff injury.\nOne thing Collins will change with his new team is his jersey number. With the Giants, Collins wore 21 to honor Sean Taylor, a star free safety for Washington, who was tragically killed at 24 during a 2007 home invasion.\nNow that he\u2019s going to play for Washington, Collins will wear number 20 instead.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a place I\u2019ve always dreamed of being at because of my favorite player,\u201d Collins said at his introductory press conference on March 14.\nCollins was given a game-worn Taylor jersey by Redskins owner Dan Snyder.\n\u201cI instantly broke down,\u201d Collins said. \u201cInstantly broke down into tears.\u201d\nWashington coach Jay Gruden said that, aside from the feel-good part of Collins joining the team, he expects a lot of the veteran.\n\u201cWe expect unbelievable things from him because he\u2019s the highest- paid safety in the NFL, so he better be the best one,\u201d Gruden said at the 2019 NFL owners\u2019 meetings in Phoenix.\nCollins didn\u2019t back down from the expectations and said he was excited to join linebacker Ryan Anderson and defensive end Jonathan Allen, who Collins played with at Alabama.\n\u201cWe know how each other plays and how we get after it,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe know what it takes to win, and all we want to do is win.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Wizards picked up an important 100-90 victory over the Orlando Magic Wednesday night, leaving them 3-and-a-half games back of the Miami Heat for the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\nDespite having the eighth-worst record in the NBA, the Wizards still have an opportunity to make the playoffs, especially after beating the Magic, one of three teams they need to pass in order to get in.\nThe Wizards also have one game against the Charlotte Hornets and the Miami Heat remaining. The Hornets and Heat are the other two teams ahead of the Wizards for the eighth seed.\nAs usual, shooting guard Bradley Beal, the Wizards leading scorer, led the way with a team-high 23 points and added seven assists, but Beal praised his teammates after the game.\n\u201cOne of the biggest areas of my game that I\u2019ve grown in is just trusting your teammates to be able to make plays,\u201d Beal said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to make every play, and especially with John (Wall) being out, and the way our team is\u2026 You have to be able to trust your teammates\u2019 abilities to be able to help and contribute.\u201d\nThe Wizards got many of those contributions off the bench Wednesday.

He played sparingly for the Los Angeles Lakers last season, averaging 1.5 points and 1.1 rebound per game.\nSmall forward Jabari Parker is another key player who comes off the bench for the Wizards. He was acquired at the trade deadline from the Chicago Bulls along with power forward Bobby Portis in exchange for small forward Otto Porter.\nSince the trade, Parker has averaged 13.9 points per game and has been very efficient with a .563 field goal percentage. His field goal percentage was .474 in his time with the Bulls this season.\nParker continued that trend making 9 of 12 shots against the Magic, scoring 19 points.\n\u201cGrowth is exciting for me and I want to keep getting better,\u201d Parker said after the win. He also spoke about the importance of remaining unselfish.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so difficult for my game to play with others,\u201d Parker said. \u201cI always want to make it easy for my teammates if I\u2019m trying to draw attention and (pass) to guys, so it\u2019s really just trying to get that type of energy day in and day out.\u201d\nUnselfish play and bench production will be crucial if the Wizards are going to sneak into the playoffs.\n\u201cI think right now it\u2019s our backs against the wall and how are we going to respond,\u201d said point guard Chasson Randle, who scored 13 points off the bench. \u201cWe\u2019re playing with a lot of energy right now and as long as we do the little things and play for each other, we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\nIf the Wizards are going to make a run, it has to be now, and the team has given fans reasons to stay hopeful, winning four of its last six.\n\u201cIt feels good to play meaningful basketball, and on the bright side, we\u2019re still in the hunt, so we\u2019re just trying to get to (the playoffs),\u201d Parker said.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Washington\u2019s NFL team has agreed to a trade with the Denver Broncos for quarterback Case Keenum, who has one year remaining on his contract.\nWashington will send a sixth-round pick in the 2020 draft and receive a 2020 seventh-round pick, said ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter on Thursday.\nThe league year begins on March 13, so the trade cannot be officially processed until then.\nKeenum is in the second year of a two-year, $36 million deal, though his contract will be reworked for the trade, and Washington is expected to pay Keenum $3.5 million for the upcoming season.\nWhile the trade doesn\u2019t involve much risk, many analysts have blasted Washington for not making a bigger move.\nWashington Post Columnist Jerry Brewer called Keenum an \u201cokay stopgap,\u201d and added that the team continues to \u201cperpetuate mediocrity.\u201d\nThe Broncos were looking to trade Keenum after they agreed to a trade for quarterback Joe Flacco earlier in the offseason.\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely disappointed, it\u2019s not something we wanted to happen,\u201d Keenum said on ESPN after learning the Broncos had traded for Flacco.\nKeenum was supposed to provide the Broncos with short-term relief but that didn\u2019t happen, said Denver Post reporter Ryan O\u2019Halloran, who added that the move would help Denver, saving $14.5 million from the team\u2019s salary cap.\nKeenum had a breakthrough season with the Minnesota Vikings in 2017, throwing 22 touchdowns and seven interceptions. He also led the Vikings to a playoff victory, but struggled with Denver last season, throwing 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. Denver ended the season with a 6-10 record.\nThe trade leaves Washington with three quarterbacks. Starter Alex Smith suffered a compound fracture in his leg last season. He also dealt with infections following the injury and needed multiple surgeries for infections in addition to surgery for the initial injury.\nWashington has not announced whether or not there is a possibility Smith will play next season.\n\u201cThis is an injury that\u2019s tough to overcome, but you also don\u2019t know Alex and what he can do with his mind and what he can overcome,\u201d Jay Gruden, Washington\u2019s coach, said on ESPN. \u201cWill he be ready next year or the year after? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll play it by ear.\u201d\nLast season was the first of a four-year, $94 million contract for Smith, after Washington signed him to replace quarterback Kirk Cousins, who signed with Minnesota after serving as Washington\u2019s starter for three consecutive seasons.\nThe other quarterback on Washington\u2019s roster is Colt McCoy, who also broke his leg last season. His injury was less severe than Smith\u2019s and he has recovered from it.\nMcCoy has spent the majority of his career as a backup and has thrown 29 touchdowns but also has 26 interceptions. He is signed for one more season.\nMcCoy has only started in 27 games in nine seasons since being drafted but has dealt with many injuries, including missing time for a neck injury in 2014 and a concussion in 2011.\nAfter Smith\u2019s injury, Washington went on to start three different quarterbacks over the team\u2019s final six games. If Smith is unable to play next season, Washington\u2019s quarterback situation remains murky, and Keenum could end up going into the season as their starter.\n\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic, if anyone can come back it\u2019s Alex\u2026we\u2019ll see,\u201d Washington\u2019s team president, Bruce Allen, told NBC Sports.",

It also bodes well for the Capitals that they have 13 goals in their last two games and none were scored by the league\u2019s leading goal scorer, Alexander Ovechkin.\nDespite the dominant victory over Ottawa, the Capitals got off to a slow start and fell behind 2-0 in the first period. They rallied to tie the game with two goals late in the first period and then carried that momentum into the second period.\nThey dominated play in the second and scored four goals in the first eleven minutes of the period.\n\u201cObviously a tough start and about halfway through the (first) period we started to realize that we needed to play at a little bit different level, and a little different compete than we started with,\u201d said head coach Todd Reirden. \u201cOur leadership group is strong and I think they did a good job of pulling everyone into the fight.\u201d\nThe Capitals were looking for more secondary scoring after waiving Devante Smith-Pelly, who scored seven goals for them in the playoffs last season. They got secondary scoring against the Senators, as center Lars Eller and winger Brett Connolly each tallied a goal and an assist.\n\u201cWe need everybody feeling good about themselves here going forward so that\u2019s a positive that we got contributions from throughout the lineup,\u201d Eller said.\nThe Capitals also got a goal from defenseman John Carlson, who put the the Capitals ahead for good on a power-play goal early in the second period. It was Carlson\u2019s 10th of the season, the most of any defenseman on the Capitals.\n\u201cI think that they\u2019re just trying to take (Ovechkin) away as best they can (on power plays) and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done a good job of it this year, but getting one (goal) tonight was nice, and when they\u2019re going to play like that, that\u2019s pretty much the only good look you\u2019re going to get,\u201d said Carlson. \u201cI\u2019ve got to make the most out of it when teams do that.\u201d\nTwo of the players held off the scoresheet over the last two games were Hagelin and Jensen. Both are known for their defensive play and ability to help kill penalties.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be here and looking to help out any way I can,\u201d said Jensen, who was traded by the Red Wings.\nWhile Jensen hasn\u2019t played in the playoffs before, Hagelin has plenty of experience. He won the Stanley Cup twice with the Pittsburgh Penguins and made a run to the Stanley Cup with the New York Rangers.\nHagelin also has 22 goals and 25 assists in 121 playoff games.\nMany of the Capitals players should be familiar with Hagelin, as he has played against them in six playoff series. Hagelin\u2019s former team beat the Capitals in five of those six series.\n\u201cDefinitely there\u2019s familiarity there and they should know what they\u2019re getting,\u201d said Hagelin, who was traded by the Los Angeles Kings. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be back here. There\u2019s a lot of familiarity from playing in all the rinks, and just knowing what to expect every night.\u201d\nReirdan spoke about the importance of experience immediately after the team acquired Hagelin.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a huge gain for us in terms of speed, experience, and the championship experience as well,\u201d said Reirden. \u201cAdditionally to that, we see him being a big part of our penalty killing and continuing to try to make that better. He\u2019s a player that for us in particular adds speed, adds forward depth, and the penalty killing has been something that we\u2019ve been trying to improve all year.\u201d\nHagelin and Jensen have both been with the Capitals for less than a week so far but time will tell if Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan made the right moves at the deadline for the Capitals to repeat as champions.",

Her extensive background in sales and marketing, including roles at Disney and ESPN, informs her approach to building community around the team.",
    "content": "ODENTON, Maryland \u2014 In the 90-minute round trip between her home outside Baltimore where she was born and raised and Piney Orchard Ice Arena in Odenton, Maryland, Robyn Remick has time to think.\nShe weighs the responsibility of turning the Maryland Black Bears hockey team into central Maryland\u2019s \u201chometown\u201d team.\n\u201cThe beauty of a long commute is that it allows you to really reflect on, \u2018What did I do well today?\u2019 I\u2019m beyond the point in my career where I need accolades,\u201d said Remick, 57, who lives in Reisterstown, Maryland, with her husband, Allan, and daughter Emily.\nAfter a 35-year career in sales and marketing in which she lived all across the country working for the likes of Disney and ESPN, Remick was hired in October as president of the Tier II junior hockey team, becoming the first female president in the North American Hockey League\u2019s 24-year history.\n\u201cShe could have taken much bigger jobs,\u201d said Murry Gunty, the Maryland Black Bears owner, who saw a kindred spirit in Remick \u2014 an innovator willing to consider any idea (within reason) and sell a vision to a hockey fan base that already exists in Maryland. \u201cShe is qualified to run a professional team.\u201d\nOn game nights, Remick can be found at the front door of the arena, greeting the roughly 300 fans who attend each home contest.\n\u201cI welcome every single fan who comes in, and I tell them \u2018Thank you for coming\u2019 when they leave,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is part of the Disney culture, which is, \u2018Welcome, we are happy you here.\u2019 You can\u2019t ever take that for granted and I never will.\u201d\nRemick often hands out her business card and answers late-night texts from the billet families who host hockey players at their homes. \u201cThe mission statement of ESPN is to take care of the fan,\u201d she said.\nRemick has been \u201cpassionate\u201d communicating with and sharing her appreciation for those families, who are scattered across the area, said billet coordinator Amanda Hafler.\n\u201cIt makes it a lot easier being a billet when you have that support,\u201d said Hafler, who hosts Luke Mountain, a forward from Minnesota.\n\u201cShe goes above and beyond when it comes to the players,\u201d said head coach Clint Mylymok. \u201cShe\u2019s highly available for all of us (and) very aware of what we\u2019re trying to do here.\u201d\nThese are the details Gunty marveled at when he first met Remick last year and invited her to a home game. She immediately began walking around the rink taking notes.\n\u201cThose are the best leaders,\u201d Gunty said. \u201cWhatever we accomplished today is old news. How do we keep making it better. How do you keep moving forward?\u201d\nRemick\u2019s sharp eye for entrepreneurial opportunities was honed at ESPN, where she served in four different executive positions for 12 years before leaving in 2016.\n\u201cYou could say, \u2018You know what would be cool \u2014 if we did this?\u2019 and two weeks later it would be on the air. That does not happen pretty much anywhere,\u201d she said.\nWorking at the popular sports network came with its share of struggles, though. \u201cIt is a testosterone-filled environment that makes it twice as hard for a woman to be heard and to be accepted,\u201d she said of ESPN. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have to act like a guy, but you have to know your stuff.\u201d\nSince joining the Black Bears, Remick has faced similar challenges \u2014 like being mistaken for Gunty\u2019s wife, something she brushed off as being \u201cpart of what happens when you are a female president of the company.\u201d\nThese kinds of interactions seem to not bother her and have never hindered her \u201cneed to succeed\u201d as she put it. Whether it was working three jobs to graduate with a degree in journalism from the University of Maryland in 1983 or selling MTV packages to pious Mississippians who called the channel a \u201cforce of evil,\u201d she never took no for an answer. Remick sees herself as an example for the next generation of sports executives, regardless of their gender.\nGunty, who owns more than 20 companies, many of which have female executives, said, \u201cI just go for the best person, whoever that is. I hope that there comes a time in our country when everybody looks at it like that.\u201d\nRemick says she has had to recalibrate her expectations somewhat. She had a staff of 30 or more at ESPN \u2014 now she oversees three people. Before a recent game, Remick and an intern ventured out into several inches of snow to post yard signs.\n\u201cIt had to be done,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t call in my people to do that.\u201d\nThough she may not have the same budget, Remick still has grand plans, like installing a center-ice scoreboard and hosting a military appreciation night to both keep fans coming back and represent the community that sits in the shadow of Fort Meade.\n\u201cWe want the team to reflect this area and that\u2019s service to country, service to each other,\u201d she said. That includes the Black Bears players. \u201cWe want every player who comes into this organization to leave here better than we got them. And that\u2019s more than on the ice. I want them to be better men.\u201d",

He led the team to at least one playoff victory during each of his first five seasons in the NFL, and became the first rookie quarterback to win two playoff games. \nFlacco went on to have one of the best postseason quarterback stretches of all-time during the 2012 playoffs, throwing for an NFL-record 11 touchdowns in the postseason, which culminated with the Ravens hoisting the Lombardi Trophy as Super Bowl Champions. Flacco earned Super Bowl MVP honors.\nAfter that historic postseason, Flacco signed a six-year contract that at the time made him the highest paid player in NFL history. Since that deal, the team\u2019s success has been less than ideal, with the Ravens only making it to the playoffs once over the next five seasons.\nDuring the 2018 NFL Draft, the Ravens used their first-round selection on former Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson, hinting that the team was planning to go in a different direction at the position in the future. \nWhile Flacco began the season as Baltimore\u2019s starting quarterback, he injured his hip midway through the season, paving the way for Jackson.

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Capitals overcame controversial calls and a high hit that briefly forced center Evgeny Kuznetsov to leave the game to beat the Colorado Avalanche 4-3 in overtime on Thursday.\nIt was the Capitals\u2019 third win in four games after the All-Star break. They had lost seven consecutive games going into the break, so the turnaround may be a sign that the reigning NHL champs are solving their problems in time for another bid for the Stanley Cup.\n\u201cThere was some adversity and some tough things that didn\u2019t go our way but we stuck with it and ended up getting rewarded at the end of the game,\u201d said head coach Todd Reirden.\nNicklas Backstrom appeared to score a goal in the first period but it was waived off after the referees concluded they had blown the whistle before the puck went into the net, even though the puck was still loose in the crease.\nEarly in the second period, backup goalie Pheonix Copley let in a goal from a bad angle but the Capitals challenged the play as offside. Even though replays appeared to show the play was offside, the call on the ice stood and the Capitals were assessed a penalty for losing the challenge. They managed to kill the penalty and keep the game tied.\nCopley let in another goal from a bad angle, allowing the Avalanche to tie the game with 2:07 remaining in the third period. He bounced back, making some clutch saves in overtime, including a game-saving stop off a one-timer.\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably one that Pheonix (Copley) would like to have back, but it\u2019s a team game,\u201d said Reirden. \u201cI loved how our team rallied behind it. We just kept going. That\u2019s a sign of a veteran team that deals with adversity and pushes forward.\u201d\nCopley agreed and praised his teammates for still finding a way to win the game.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just got to make those saves,\u201d said Copley. \u201cA late goal like that and the guys still battle and finish it, so it\u2019s a great character win for us.\u201d\nThe Capitals came into the game looking for role players to contribute and they got that from winger Andre Burakovsky, who got the Caps on the board in the first period.\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to do the best I can every game whoever coach is putting me out there,\u201d said Burakovsky. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking a lot about how you have to deserve your ice time and I think I\u2019ve been battling.\u201d\nThe Capitals also got a goal from a defenseman when Matt Niskanen buried a shot off a rebound early in the third period.\nDespite the win, Niskanen was frustrated that the Avalanche were able to score late and tie the game.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty good with that over the last couple of years but lately a few have slipped away, so we\u2019ll address it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been defending better and the offense is starting to come again,\u201d said Niskanen. \u201cIt seems to me that our structure is fine. We just need to be a little more desperate as the clock is winding down.\u201d\nDespite allowing a goal late in the third period, the Capitals got a big boost from winger Tom Wilson, which they carried into overtime.\nWhen Avalanche defenseman Ian Cole\u2019s high hit away from the puck left Kuznetsov shaken up in the third period, Wilson immediately jumped in and challenged Cole. Wilson also fired up the crowd after landing some big punches when Cole obliged and dropped the gloves. Cole was assessed a game misconduct for the hit.\nKuznetsov got his own revenge on Cole and the Avalanche when winger Alexander Ovechkin sprung him on a breakaway and he slid the puck past former Capitals goalie Semyon Varlamov to win the game.\n\u201cWe all know Tom plays physical,\u201d said Kuznetsov. \u201cWhen (expletive) like that happened he stood up, and it\u2019s always nice to have a guy like that.\u201d\nThe Capitals got contributions from their stars in Ovechkin and Kuznetsov, but role players also stepped up in the Capitals victory.\n\u201cWe battled through some things that didn\u2019t go our way, and there was no quit, and we found a way to get two points,\u201d Reirden said.",

    "summary": "In a defensive-dominated Super Bowl LIII, the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3, with key plays by cornerback Stephon Gilmore securing the win. The game featured limited offensive output, with the Rams' offense particularly struggling due to injuries and strong defensive pressure.",
    "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Brandin Cooks had barely noticed the ball was in the air by the time New England Patriots cornerback Stephon Gilmore jumped up and intercepted Rams quarterback Jared Goff at the 2-yard line late in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LIII on Sunday.\nThe Rams\u2019 offense had struggled all night, and Goff had rarely tried to throw downfield. But trailing by a touchdown and with an all-out blitz in his face, the third-year quarterback tried to force one.\nGilmore was more prepared for it than Cooks, and Gilmore\u2019s interception set up the Patriots\u2019 game-sealing drive during a 13-3 Super Bowl win that was dominated by defense.\n\u201cWhen they get towards the touchdown, they like to take shots. I knew he was going to chuck it up and I made a great play,\u201d Gilmore said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you dream about. It\u2019s a great feeling.\u201d\nThe Patriots\u2019 sixth Super Bowl win in the past 17 years featured their biggest margin of victory, but also perhaps the least excitement, with just one touchdown and two turnovers combined between the teams.\n\u201cThe Rams played so well. Their defense was great, they made it tough on every play,\u201d Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said. \u201cWe finally got a touchdown, and our defense had their best game of the year.\u201d\nNew England outgained the Rams, 407-206, but a few key plays early meant the Patriots could only muster a field goal before halftime, leading 3-0 at the break.\nLos Angeles, meanwhile, struggled on offense. Rams running back Todd Gurley had just three carries for 10 yards before halftime and didn\u2019t appear to be at full strength, battling a left knee injury that wasn\u2019t mentioned on Los Angeles\u2019 injury reports throughout practice but clearly seemed to be an issue, with backup CJ Anderson receiving more carries than Gurley.\nAfter the game, however, Gurley and head coach Sean McVay again insisted the star running back was healthy.\nThere were no injuries \u2014 real or imagined \u2014 to blame for the anemic passing attack, however. Goff finished 19-38 for 229 yards and an interception, never looking like the quarterback that led the NFL\u2019s best offense in 2018.\n\u201c[The loss] kills, and it hurts me so much just knowing how well our defense played,\u201d Goff said. \u201cTo play that well defensively and us not hold up our end of the bargain. It\u2019s our job to score points, and we didn\u2019t do that tonight.\u201d\nAfter driving to the 34-yard line on the opening drive, Brady\u2019s first pass of the game was intercepted by linebacker Corey Littleton after being tipped by cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman.\nOn their next drive, the Patriots faced a fourth-and-5 from the 28-yard line and attempted a field goal, but kicker Stephen Gostkowski pushed the field goal wide left.\nLater in the half, New England was on the brink of field goal range before a sack from defensive end John Franklin-Myers pushed them back. The Rams\u2019 defensive line was winning enough battles to prevent Brady from getting too comfortable and stop the running game from chewing up time of possession.\n\u201cWe moved the ball decent, we just couldn\u2019t get the points on the board for one reason or another,\u201d Brady said. \u201cBut in the end, it feels a lot better than last year, when we did get some points on the board [and lost].\u201d\nThe Rams finally got on the board with their third series of the second half, when a series of Goff passes led to a field goal. For a couple of seconds, however, the drive seemed destined to end with a touchdown.\nOn first down from the 29-yard line, Goff fired a pass to Cooks, who was standing all alone in the back of the end zone. But the pass took long enough to arrive that cornerback Jason McCourty had just enough time to recover and come all the way across the field to break up the pass as it arrived.\n\u201cJust running my tail off on the backside,\u201d McCourty said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great play as a defense, but we were able to get the ball out.\u201d\nMcCourty\u2019s desperation play held the Rams to a 53-yard field goal from Greg Zuerlein that locked the game at 3-3 entering the fourth quarter.\nThe Patriots\u2019 touchdown drive was a flash, needing just five plays and 2:49 to go 69 yards and score. Brady began the series with four consecutive passes, the final being a 29-yard touch pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski that put brought the Patriots down to the 2-yard line and setting up a score from running back Sony Michel.\nLos Angeles nearly had an answer, with Goff throwing for completions of 19 yards, 11 yards and 17 yards to put the Rams on the 27-yard line. There, he tried to find Cooks in the end zone twice. After the first was broken up, Gilmore was in perfect position to intercept the next.\n\u201cStephon got the pick and then we were able to run a bunch down and [Gostkowski] kicked a field goal,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThat was a great way to end it.\u201d\nThe Patriots then chewed up 3:05 of the final 4:17 with a 72-yard drive that ended with a field goal, putting the Rams down two scores with just more than a minute to play and no timeouts.\nZuerlein missed a 48-yard field goal with eight seconds left to seal it completely, and the Patriots left Mercedes Benz-Stadium with another ring.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty,\u201d said wide receiver Julian Edelman, whose 141 receiving yards earned him MVP honors, \u201cbut I\u2019ll take that ugly win over a pretty loss any day.\u201d\nJames Crabtree-Hannigan is a senior in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, covering the Super Bowl for the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism.",

    "summary": "Micah Kiser, a former Gilman School football player now with the Los Angeles Rams, reflects on the competitive high school football landscape in Baltimore that has changed significantly since his time, particularly with St. Frances Academy's rise to dominance and the subsequent changes in league dynamics.",
    "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 For the three years Micah Kiser played varsity football at Gilman School in Baltimore, the Greyhounds and Calvert Hall were two of the best teams in the state and played a series of instant-classics, most memorably a 2011 MIAA championship that went to double overtime.\nThe Cardinals got the best of Gilman in 2010 by completing a 19-point comeback with a scoop-and-score on a high snap on a punt to steal an upset win, and Gilman capped a two-game sweep the next year by batting down a Calvert Hall two-point conversion attempt to secure its second title of a three-championship, four-year run.\nAbout six years after he graduated, Kiser is preparing for Super Bowl LIII with the Los Angeles Rams, while the MIAA is fractured to the degree that it canceled the 2018 playoffs. St. Frances Academy\u2019s emergence as not only a local powerhouse, but one of the best teams in the nation, has caused the rest of the league to bow out of playing them.\nMost of the four Maryland high school products playing in Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl between the Rams and New England Patriots were in school less than a decade ago, but were competing in a high school football landscape that looks much different than today\u2019s, most notably for Kiser and the Baltimore private schools.\n\u201cPlaying Baltimore sports when I was there, we had the best athletes in any sport,\u201d Kiser said. \u201cFor them to kind of shy away from competition the way they did was kind of disappointing to me. A lot of guys can play college ball at Mount Saint Joseph. At McDonough. And for them to kind of shy away from playing the team, I wouldn\u2019t have done that. I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d\nMany of those schools, however, would argue St. Frances is a different program than anything that came before it. The change began in 2016, when the Gilman coaching staff led by Biff Poggi had a falling out with school administration and elected to move en masse to the previously lowly St. Frances.\nKiser still harbors some resentment toward his alma mater for what he feels was an ousting of coaches he credits with helping turn him into an NFL-caliber player.\n\u201cI think Gilman kind of dropped the ball,\u201d Kiser said. \u201cThere was a misconception that there was a bunch of recruited players, when that wasn\u2019t the case. \u2026 Seeing what they did with the program was disappointing.\u201d\nEven after Kiser\u2019s former coaches moved to St. Frances, though, they weren\u2019t expecting the response that came from the rest of the league, nor the headlines that followed. After going undefeated in the MIAA in 2016, the Panthers kicked it up a notch in 2017, outscoring their league opponents by a combined score of 343-50 and finishing the season as a consensus top-five team in the nation.\nThen, beginning around Memorial Day last year, Baltimore teams began dropping off St. Frances\u2019 schedule, most citing safety concerns. With the notion of playing a regular schedule suddenly out the window, head coach Henry Russell and the rest of his staff scrambled to craft a schedule on par with their national standing, filled with the high school football elite.\n\u201cThe timing of it really caught us off guard,\u201d Russell said. \u201cFrom that point on, it was really just trying to get a schedule and give our kids an opportunity to have a football season.\u201d\nBefore the season, the MIAA announced St. Frances as champion and said there would be no playoffs in 2018. St. Frances went undefeated against a schedule that included no Baltimore teams and only one Maryland team but still wasn\u2019t up to its caliber. The Panthers\u2019 lowest margin of victory was 29 points.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure some of the teams [like] Spaulding and St. Joe would\u2019ve liked an opportunity to play us,\u201d Russell said. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\nControversy remains on both sides. St. Frances detractors say Poggi\u2019s staff has turned St. Frances into a football factory, not a school. Its supporters say some of the critiques are racially motivated, pointing out that nobody had complaints when Poggi was leading Gilman \u2014 a whiter, wealthier school located much further from inner-city Baltimore \u2014 to MIAA domination.\nBut whatever the reasons, the result is a league that is a shell of its former self. And to some third-parties like legendary Good Counsel head coach Bob Milloy, who retired in 2017, that is something to mourn.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the local league championship and rivalries, because nobody will play them,\u201d Milloy told Povich Center/Capital News Service. \u201cThat\u2019s a drawback, I think. That\u2019s a part of high school football. \u2026 But they have a goal, which is to be No. 1 in the country. And hey, that\u2019s what they want to do, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good for some kids, it\u2019s not good for all the kids.\u201d\nRussell tries not to dwell on what\u2019s missing from the St. Frances schedule, instead focusing on the impressive teams the Panthers will play, like the vaunted IMG Academy.\n\u201cOur kids have a unique opportunity to play some of the nation\u2019s best. We\u2019re playing IMG next year in the middle of October, which wouldn\u2019t have happened if we were still playing the Baltimore schools,\u201d Russell said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty exciting stuff for our kids. They\u2019ve gotten a lot of support from all sorts of people in the community, and I think they like representing Baltimore and Maryland on a national scale.\u201d\nRams defensive back Blake Countess, who transferred from Gilman to Good Counsel for his final two years of high school, agreed with many of Milloy\u2019s thoughts about the loss of the local schedule.\nBut he also accurately points out that St. Frances is merely following a blueprint crafted by other schools like IMG Academy.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the culture of high school football now. These coaches, they get together and they\u2019re running it kind of like a prep school [or] college,\u201d said Countess, who graduated in 2011. \u201cA lot of times it\u2019s for the better of the player, but I think it takes away a little bit from the competition. \u2026 But definitely, in my opinion, if you can go to private school, you go.\u201d\nAccording to most, the gap between private schools \u2014 especially those in the powerful WCAC in the Washington D.C. area \u2014 and public schools has only widened in recent years.\nAs recently as 2015, the final Washington Post football rankings of the year had eight public schools in the top 10. Last year, private schools had four of the top-five and six of the top 10.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compare [public and private],\u201d said Bryan Pierre, longtime coach of Northwestern High School, a public school in Hyattsville, Maryland, where Rams safety John Johnson graduated from in 2013. \u201cWe don\u2019t try to compare nor try to compete. At a public school, you just have the kids that are in your neighborhood.\u201d\nThere are still some public school powerhouses in the area, notably Wise (Upper Marlboro) and Quince Orchard (Gaithersburg), but the general consensus is that the difference between the haves and have nots has never been greater.\nThat\u2019s true for the gulf between public and private schools, and also between most private schools and the truly elite, like St. Frances. And while that growing disparity leads to its fair share of skepticism and bitterness, with four Maryland high school products in the Super Bowl coming from a variety of backgrounds and places, the players and coaches involved view this moment as a time to celebrate the football talent in the area rather than begrudge anybody else their success.\n\u201cThe high school football game is on a national stage. ESPN has taken us to new realms,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cGonzaga and St. John\u2019s and DeMatha during this year were in the top 25 in the national rankings. That\u2019s huge for our area. \u2026 I\u2019m not upset because it\u2019s another Maryland football team on a national stage. I\u2019m rooting for that. I want to see Maryland kids do great.\u201d\nJames Crabtree-Hannigan is a senior in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, covering the Super Bowl for the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism.",

Now a standout safety for the Los Angeles Rams, Johnson's competitive drive and dramatic flair have propelled him to the Super Bowl.",
    "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 One day in the winter of 2011, John Johnson\u2019s father stopped by a Northwestern High School basketball practice to check up on his son, who was the team\u2019s starting point guard as a sophomore the year prior.\nWhen he got there, Johnson was nowhere to be found. In fact, he hadn\u2019t picked up a basketball since the end of the football season. Without telling anybody, Johnson had quit the Wildcats basketball team in order to chase the football scholarships offers he felt he could garner if he devoted himself fully to the gridiron.\nJohnson\u2019s dad was so incensed that he didn\u2019t talk to his son for days, and the school\u2019s football coaches were suddenly in the line of fire from him as well as the basketball staff, Johnson remembers. But just about every day for the next three months, Johnson worked out in the weight room \u2014 and in the hallway outside of it \u2014 and added about 15 pounds on his previously lean frame, coinciding with a growth spurt that pushed him to about 6-feet and put him on the radar of colleges.\nThat unyielding determination and competitiveness, combined with an adept football mind, have turned Johnson into a rising star at safety for the Los Angeles Rams, maintaining the upward trajectory he began by bursting onto the scene late in his career at his Prince George\u2019s County public high school.\n\u201cJohn is the most fiery, competitive, driven young man that I have coached,\u201d said Steve Rapp, who coached Johnson at Northwestern. \u201cHe just \u2014 he\u2019s got the dog in him. He\u2019s got the dog.\u201d\nJohnson has always been headstrong and possessed a flair for the dramatic. From telling Rapp he was going to \u201cmake a power move\u201d but not specifying that meant his basketball days were over, to his use of the New Orleans-originated Choppa Style celebration after intercepting Saints quarterback Drew Brees in overtime of the NFC championship game, Johnson doesn\u2019t shy from the spotlight, seemingly made for the type of stage Super Bowl LIII will provide him Sunday.\nNorthwestern head coach Bryan Pierre remembers Johnson stepping up in big games, like his senior year performance against local powerhouse Wise High School in 2012, when the Wildcats revamped the offense in order to get the ball in Johnson\u2019s hands as much as possible as a wildcat quarterback. Wise cruised to a 47-8 victory, but Johnson filled up the stat sheet with passes, receptions and rushes, scored all of his team\u2019s points by rushing in a 40-yard touchdown and then converting the two-point conversion on a fake field goal.\nAccording to Rapp, who is now offensive coordinator at Wise, it\u2019s not enough to merely say Johnson played both ways for the Wildcats, pointing out that he did everything from quarterback to long snap.\n\u201cHe played everything except the D-Line and the O-Line,\u201d Rapp said. \u201cHe would go, \u2018Alright, well I could throw the ball farther than you. Well, I\u2019m faster than you. I can hit harder. I can cover better. You need me to do that, coach? No problem. I got it.\u2019\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t just Johnson\u2019s competitiveness that turned him into such a versatile weapon for the Wildcats, and later Boston College and the Rams.\nHis mental aptitude allowed him to absorb game plans from a number of different positions, and it allowed Pierre plenty of peace of mind. When Pierre couldn\u2019t make a 7-on-7 tournament, Rapp was concerned, but Pierre assured him Johnson could handle the defensive play-calling duties. Sure enough, they went on to win the tournament, Rapp said.\n\u201cI always tried to be a leader. Everybody knew I was a leader, me and [running back Darius Victor], we were the leaders,\u201d Johnson said at Super Bowl media night Monday. \u201cWe could\u2019ve done it without any coaches.\u201d\nJohnson eventually caught the attention of various colleges and settled on Boston College, where he got playing time as a true freshman and added 22 pounds over his four years while bouncing between safety and cornerback.\nThe Rams liked what they saw on tape and what they heard from his college coaches, Los Angeles safeties coach Ejiro Evero said Monday, so they selected Johnson in the third round of the 2017 draft. He started 11 games as a freshman and all 18 en route to the Super Bowl this year, helping clinch the Rams\u2019 trip to Atlanta by intercepting Brees.\n\u201cSince we drafted him, it\u2019s been everything we thought we were getting,\u201d Evero said. \u201cYou don\u2019t typically give a player with that little experience as much to handle as we do, but he never flinches. Never blinks.\u201d\nBecause Pierre stayed at his public high school rather than one of the area\u2019s vaunted private options, the Wildcats coaching staff had to put in extra hours in order to get Johnson the exposure he needed. It\u2019s a process Rapp is plenty familiar with \u2014 driving around the country for showcases and campus visits, the dozens of emails to college coaches \u2014 and Johnson never considered transferring once he got to Northwestern.\n\u201cI just like the chip on your shoulder, the edge that public schools have,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey can recruit. We can\u2019t. We just got a bunch of guys from the neighborhood. I just like the family aspect.\u201d\nThat close-knit nature explains why Rapp texts Johnson compliments or critiques of his play as he watches him on Sundays.\nIt explains why Northwestern put a photo of Johnson\u2019s Choppa Style celebration on their morning announcements last week.\nAnd it explains why Johnson took a risk after his junior season of football, putting his future in Rapp\u2019s hands following a brief conversation that Rapp didn\u2019t immediately realize the importance of. But when the offensive coordinator saw Johnson in the weight room day after day rather than on the hardwood, it became clear the switch had flipped, and Johnson had found a new gear that would propel him from being an undersized safety lacking the Division I offers he needed to being a highlight machine on the biggest stage in American sports eight years later.\n\u201cI just had to make a sacrifice. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. It ended up paying off, as you can see, because I got to this point,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I want to be great and I know what it takes in order to be great.\u201d\nJames Crabtree-Hannigan is a senior in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, covering the Super Bowl for the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism.",

    "summary": "Micah Kiser, a Los Angeles Rams linebacker, demonstrated his high football IQ early in his career at Gilman School in Baltimore, where he made a critical play against Don Bosco Prep's undefeated team. Despite a challenging preseason moment in 2018, Kiser's coaches believe his instinctual and aware playing style could lead to success in the NFL.",
    "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 As Los Angeles Rams linebacker Micah Kiser came downfield toward the Houston Texans backfield during the third week of the 2018 NFL preseason, he was met by Texans offensive lineman Roderick Johnson. \nJohnson pushed Kiser back about 10 yards, thwarted the rookie\u2019s grasping attempts to bring down running back Lavon Coleman and eventually sent Kiser to the ground as the play ended. \nA few minutes later, Kiser again charged toward the line of scrimmage as Coleman took a handoff. This time, Kiser deftly sidestepped a pulling lineman and immediately engulfed Coleman with a textbook tackle, dropping him for a 2-yard loss. \nOnce the regular season began, Kiser hardly played defensive snaps, but the Woodlawn, Maryland, native\u2019s coaches say his strong football IQ gives him the potential to shine as an NFL linebacker down the road. To capitalize on that promise, he must minimize plays like the unfortunate encounter with Johnson and turn in more like the eye-catching tackle for loss. \n\u201cHe has that God-given trait,\u201d Rams linebackers coach Joe Barry said Wednesday. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a guy that\u2019s highly instinctual and highly aware. \u2026 Those are traits that guys just have.\u201d\nLong before Kiser and the Rams earned a trip to Super Bowl LIII against the New England Patriots in Atlanta Feb. 3, his advanced grasp of the mental side of the game was on display at Gilman School in Baltimore, where he started for three years at middle linebacker. \nDuring Kiser\u2019s senior season in 2012, Gilman played Don Bosco Prep (New Jersey), which had a nation-leading 46-game win streak. With Don Bosco leading 6-0 in the first quarter and threatening to score again, Kiser dropped back into coverage and spotted an Ironman receiver running an out route.  \nIt was a play Gilman had practiced during the week leading up to the highly anticipated game, and Kiser executed perfectly. Both Kiser and Henry Russell, Gilman\u2019s linebackers coach at the time, vividly remember what happened next. \nKiser closed on the receiver and got there in plenty of time to pick off the pass. Seventy-one yards and a broken tackle later, Kiser returned it for a touchdown that sparked Gilman\u2019s 13-6 win. \n\u201cHe\u2019s extremely smart. He understood what offenses were trying to do and what we would do as a defense to take that away,\u201d Russell said. \u201cMentally, he\u2019s probably the strongest kid I\u2019ve coached at the linebacker position. \u2026 That\u2019s a big reason of why he\u2019s in the NFL.\u201d\nKiser attributes some of his football savvy to his time at Gilman, where coaches had him learn the entire defense so he could help better prepare his teammates on the field. That gave him a broader understanding of the importance and usefulness of game film, and the pick-six against Don Bosco and tackle for loss against the Texans are examples of something he learned from his high school defensive coordinator, Stan White.\n\u201cDefense is reactionary. You\u2019re always reacting to what the offense does. Coach White always said if you can get a couple of extra steps, that will help you,\u201d Kiser said at media night Monday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all about studying the game and knowing what they\u2019re going to do to you before it happens.\u201d\nKiser\u2019s intelligence extended to the classroom. While playing at Virginia, he made multiple Academic All-America teams and won the Campbell Trophy \u2014 often referred to as the \u201cAcademic Heisman\u201d \u2014 his senior year. \nStill, during the draft process last spring, Barry had to do his due diligence. And when he called Cavaliers head coach Bronco Mendenhall, he was blown away by the endorsement. \n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard a head coach talk about a player the way [Mendenhall] talked about Micah,\u201d Barry said. \u201cAnd being around the kid for seven months, all those things that were said about him were absolutely true.\u201d\nLos Angeles took Kiser in the fifth round, and the 6-foot, 244-pound linebacker has been doing all he can to impress them since. He led the team with 26 total tackles during the preseason, while no other Ram had more than 13. \n\u201cThe best way to describe him is just a productive football player,\u201d head coach Sean McVay told reporters after the preseason. \u201cJoe Barry and [assistant linebackers coach] Chris Shula have done an excellent job with him. He is just getting better and better.\u201d\nHowever, there are still strides Kiser needs to take, Barry said. \n\u201cThe NFL game compared to the college game is night-and-day different, just from a speed perspective,\u201d Barry said. \u201cHe\u2019s smart. He knows everything. But to be able to match [running] backs and cover backs, and match tight ends and cover tight ends. For him to go to the next level, he has to be able to do that.\u201d\nFortunately, Barry considers those goals reachable \u2014 and teachable. Russell called Kiser \u201ca coach\u2019s dream\u201d due to his approach to the game, and Barry gushes about the rookie for the same reason. His cerebral approach raises his ceiling as an NFL prospect and gives the Rams plenty of reason to work on raising the other areas of his game to match the level of his intelligence. \n\u201cI can teach a linebacker how to use his hands better. Teach him how to use his feet better. You can go in the weight room and get stronger,\u201d Barry said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t teach instincts. You can\u2019t teach awareness. \u2026 He just has God-given natural instincts and awareness when it comes to playing the game of football.\n\u201cIf he can do all those things as far as adapting to the speed of the game, then you\u2019ve got a damn good NFL linebacker. And he\u2019s right there.\u201d\nJames Crabtree-Hannigan is a senior in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, covering the Super Bowl for the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism.",

His journey from being cut from Florida's program to a key player on a championship team highlights his resilience and rapid development.",
    "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 About a week into New England Patriots training camp last summer, 10th-year pro Jason McCourty had a question for rookie cornerback JC Jackson.\n\u201cHow did you not get drafted?\u201d\nIt was a mystery Jackson had likely given plenty of thought to during the months since the NFL Draft, when all 256 picks went by without any team calling his name.\nBut shortly after the University of Maryland product signed with New England as an undrafted free agent, McCourty and the Patriots realized he could make an impact on defense. Not even Jackson anticipated having the role he\u2019s taken on late in the season, however, as he enters Super Bowl LIII against the Los Angeles Rams with six starts in New England\u2019s past seven games.\n\u201cEverything\u2019s kind of eye-opening for him,\u201d McCourty said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cEverything\u2019s a new learning experience.\u201d\nWith Jackson and McCourty watching from the bench while the Patriots\u2019 offense marched down the field in overtime of the AFC championship, it was Jackson\u2019s turn to ask the veteran a question.\n\u201cHe\u2019s asking me, \u2018If we go down and score right now, what does that mean?\u2019 McCourty recalled. \u201cI was like, \u2018If we go down and score, just come with me. We\u2019re going to sprint on the field because the game\u2019s going to be over.\u2019\u201d\nSure enough, quarterback Tom Brady and the Patriots finished off the Kansas City Chiefs with a touchdown and set off the celebration for Jackson and the rest of the team.\nIt\u2019s a height that Jackson seemed unlikely to reach at many points during his career. A four-star recruit from Immokalee, Florida, Jackson played the first game of his true freshman season at Florida but suffered a season-ending injury. He would never take the field again for the Gators, being cut from the program following an arrest on charges he was later fully acquitted of.\nThe 6-foot-1, 198-pound defensive back went across the country to Riverside City College in California for a season that tested his resolve and desire to play football before returning to Division I at Maryland.\n\u201cTry to get to the NFL, that was my main goal [at Maryland]. Get my degree and try to make football a living,\u201d Jackson said at media day Monday. \u201cI was more honed and more focused. Going to Maryland, it was just different. That was the most focused I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\nIn his two years as a Terp, Jackson started 23 of 24 games, tallying four interceptions, 13 pass breakups and 80 tackles. He declared for the draft after the 2017 season and received an invite to the NFL combine, where he had respectable results across the board and maintained his late-round draft stock.\nInstead, he went undrafted, which Jackson still struggles to find the words to describe.\n\u201cIt was just \u2014 I had to deal with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was out of my control. I just dealt with going undrafted, and I took advantage of my opportunity. All I really needed was an opportunity.\u201d\nReviewing his options as a free agent after the draft, Jackson chose to sign with the Patriots due to the quality of their organization, he said.\nNew England cornerbacks coach Josh Boyer was impressed by Jackson\u2019s skillset but also saw a need for further development.\n\u201cHe was a physical player, he had good movement skills, he was strong at the top of the route. And there was some things that you\u2019re like, \u2018OK, we need to work on this, but we can work with this,\u2019\u201d Boyer said. \u201cThe college game and the pro game is different. \u2026 There\u2019s an adjustment period there.\u201d\nSo, despite Boyer describing Jackson as \u201cvery competitive\u201d during offseason OTAs and training camp, the rookie was inactive for the first two weeks and was a healthy scratch again in Week 6. He\u2019s played every game since, however, earning his first start in Week 13 and starting every game except the divisional round since.\n\u201cThe kid can play, and he can cover his butt off,\u201d McCourty said. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun to see him just work and work.\u201d\nOne of the keys to Jackson\u2019s emergence, Boyer said, was coachability. Cornerback Duron Harmon, who\u2019s been with the Patriots since 2013, said Jackson frequently asks him questions during meetings and film sessions.\n\u201cI saw a hungry young player who had phenomenal man-to-man skills who was eager to learn,\u201d Harmon said Monday. \u201cAlways wanting to talk football. It\u2019s the reason we have asked him to go out there and play the significant plays that he\u2019s played, and he\u2019s played them at a high level.\u201d\nJackson has three interceptions and eight pass deflections this season, featuring in both the Patriots\u2019 nickel and base packages at various times late in the year. Despite being undrafted and not becoming a key part of the defense until the end of the season, however, Jackson and his teammates feel he\u2019s still a similar player to the one that came into training camp and quickly caught McCourty\u2019s attention.\nIt didn\u2019t take long to realize Jackson belonged on the field, and since he first made it there, it\u2019s been hard to take him off.\n\u201cOnce he got his opportunity to play and go out there, he showed he can play at a high level,\u201d Harmon said. \u201cEver since then, he hasn\u2019t looked back.\u201d\nIndeed, as Jackson milled around the Super Bowl media night festivities, he wasn\u2019t overly eager to reflect on the moments of his life when it seemed he wouldn\u2019t be here. But he knows what reaching the Super Bowl represents, no matter the path he took to it.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy, but I\u2019m here now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to let this speak for itself. Being here is going to speak for itself. You\u2019re at the Super Bowl, that means you\u2019re doing something.\u201d\nJames Crabtree-Hannigan is a senior in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, covering the Super Bowl for the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism.",

    "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 As Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jared Goff peeled off his helmet and headed toward the sidelines in the second quarter of the NFC championship, Blake Countess settled into his upback position and scanned the New Orleans Saints\u2019 formation, checking whether their coverage was susceptible to the fake punt called by Rams special teams coach John Fassel.\nPunter Johnny Hekker may have been the one who threw the first-down pass and extended a drive that eventually turned into the Rams\u2019 first points of their comeback victory, but it\u2019s Countess who really took on the role of quarterback.\n\u201cHe\u2019s our Swiss Army knife,\u201d Fassel said at Super Bowl media day on Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s on every phase of every [special teams] play. He\u2019s taking over 30 snaps a game just on special teams.\u201d\nCountess hit some bumps in the road after shining for legendary coach Bob Milloy at Good Counsel High School in Olney, Maryland, from 2007-2011, but he\u2019s found a home on Fassel\u2019s vaunted special teams units and is an unsung hero of the Rams\u2019 run to Super Bowl LIII, where they will face the New England Patriots on Sunday at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just one of those guys that is just steady,\u201d Milloy told Capital News Service. \u201cHe\u2019s not spectacular, but he is, in his own way. You have to be spectacular to be in that league four years.\u201d\nCountess\u2019 natural athleticism as a cornerback at Good Counsel helped earn him a scholarship to Michigan, where he made starts as a true freshman in 2011 and was slated to take a step forward during his sophomore campaign. Just two drives into the 2012 season-opener, however, he tore his ACL.\n\u201cI had a great camp and I was feeling good about myself,\u201d Countess said at media day. \u201c[After the injury], I had to look at myself in the mirror and really bounce back.\u201d\nFollowing surgery to repair his knee, Countess returned to the field in 2013 and garnered All-Big Ten honors. But his college career had another twist when Jim Harbaugh took over before the 2015 season. Cornerbacks in Harbaugh\u2019s defenses are typically expected to press receivers at the line of scrimmage, and standing at 5-foot-10, 191 pounds, Countess relies more on his speed than strength.\nThe Owings Mills, Maryland, native transferred to Auburn for his final year of eligibility, which provided him the opportunity to show his versatility. In addition to playing cornerback for the Tigers, Countess made starts at nickelback and safety.\n\u201cBeing able to add that to my resume at the level of the SEC was exactly what I needed at the time,\u201d Countess said.\nMoving around the field wasn\u2019t entirely new for Countess. He\u2019s always been defensive-minded, but Milloy and his then-offensive coordinator, Andy Stefanelli, also used Countess on offense.\n\u201cThat ability to adapt and go where you\u2019re needed has served him well throughout his career,\u201d Stefanelli told Capital News Service.\nAfter Countess showed some of that adaptability at Auburn, the Philadelphia Eagles selected him in the sixth round of the 2016 draft. Philadelphia cut Countess after the preseason, though, and despite having battled adversity during college, Countess said the experience of being cut was uniquely challenging.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything can prepare you for that moment,\u201d Countess said. \u201c[But] this league is a business. If you play long enough, you more than likely will get cut at some point.\u201d\nStefanelli, meanwhile, hoped Countess\u2019 over-before-it-started stint with the Eagles wasn\u2019t the end of the road in the NFL.\n\u201cIf you give him a chance, he\u2019s going to show you what he can do,\u201d said Stefanelli, who took over as Good Counsel head coach following Milloy\u2019s retirement in 2017. \u201cBut being a little bit of an undersized guy, you wonder, \u2018Is he going to get the opportunity?\u2019\u201d\nThe Rams picked up Countess early in the 2016 season, but he didn\u2019t make his NFL debut until Week 12 of Los Angeles\u2019 4-12 campaign. Sean McVay took over the Rams\u2019 head coaching job the next year and overhauled most of the coaching staff, leaving Fassel as one of the only holdovers from the Jeff Fisher regime. That allowed Fassel and Countess to continue to build their budding partnership.\nCountess has always shown an affinity for special teams, Milloy said, as evidenced by his numerous returning touchdowns at Good Counsel. He\u2019s filled in as a returner at times with the Rams, but most of his impact comes from the other areas of special teams.\n\u201cBlake is a tireless worker,\u201d Hekker said. \u201c[He\u2019s] a core contributor on every phase of special teams. He\u2019s a guy that has earned a lot of respect in our locker room.\u201d\nFassel said plays like the fake punt against the Saints are only possible because of Countess\u2019 work ethic.\n\u201cWhat Jared Goff does every down is basically what [Countess] does on punts. \u2026 There\u2019s a trust level where you can\u2019t just throw anybody in there to do it,\u201d Fassel said. \u201cIf you\u2019re nodding off in a meeting or you\u2019re jacking around in practice, we\u2019re probably not calling it, or we\u2019re messing it up.\u201d\nCountess\u2019 drive and tenacity allowed him to overcome the knee injury and coaching change at Michigan, the disappointment of being cut by Philadelphia and being undersized at a position that continues to demand more height and strength.\nAnd now, his dedication and attention to detail helped the Rams to their first Super Bowl appearance since 2001.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not one of those 22 starters, you have to have some special teams value or you will not be on the roster for very long,\u201d Countess said. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to take a rep off or slack in one area, ultimately that\u2019s going to come back and bite you. That\u2019s kind of the approach I\u2019ve had since I was little.\n\u201cI\u2019m a [special-teamer] right now. That\u2019s my role this year. \u2026 And on special teams, we\u2019ve made plays that dictate the outcome of games.\u201d\nJames Crabtree-Hannigan is a senior in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, covering the Super Bowl for the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism.",

    "summary": "Carie Dever-Boaz, despite initial reluctance, became the head coach of the Washington Glory, a professional women\u2019s softball team that won the NPF Championship in its first year but faced financial difficulties leading to its dissolution before the 2009 season. Despite early success, the team's struggles included late paychecks and a shrinking fan base, ultimately resulting in the players' contracts being sold to the USSSA Pride.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Carie Dever-Boaz was ready to step away from coaching college softball when the phone rang.\nAfter spending two years at the University of Virginia as the Cavaliers\u2019 head softball coach, Dever-Boaz was expecting to make the trip back to her home area of Memphis, Tennessee, to spend time with family and put college softball in the background of her 12-year coaching career.\nShe was not expecting a man named Paul Wilson to give her a call that changed her plans. He was starting a professional women\u2019s softball team called the Washington Glory, and he wanted her to be the head coach.\n\u201cI said \u2018I am not interested and you can\u2019t afford me,\u2019 jokingly,\u201d Dever-Boaz recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018throw out a price,\u2019 so I threw out something I thought was absurd\u2026and he said, \u2018OK, it\u2019s a done deal.\u2019\u201d\nAfter talking it over with her family, Dever-Boaz agreed, and in 2007 she and Wilson created one of the hottest teams in the National Pro Fastpitch league.\nFormer Washington Glory player Stephanie Best takes a swing at a pitch. (Photo courtesy of Paul Wilson)\nThe Glory won the NPF Championship in its first year, finishing 34-10. The roster was riddled with high-profile talent like former University of Tennessee pitcher Monica Abbott and longtime veterans.\nOn the surface, it appeared as if the team was trending up with no signs of peaking any time soon. \nBut the success was actually a facade for a cold reality: the team was broke.\n\u201cWhat happened\u2026really was a sad state of affairs,\u201d Dever-Boaz said. \nThe team was moved from its original home at George Mason University to Westfield Softball Complex in Fairfax County before the 2008 season. Paychecks started to come later and later. And the fan base that regularly filled 500 seats for home games had decreased.\nThe team made it back to the championship but lost to the Chicago Bandits. Eventually, the team acquired too much debt and folded before the 2009 season.\nThe players\u2019 contracts were sold to the USSSA Pride and shipped to Florida. Some players, like Abbott, continued to play softball long after their days with the Glory. Others didn\u2019t make it that long and pursued other careers.\nBut the feeling wasn\u2019t the same. The culture was different, and there are many who were associated with the organization who wish it had ended differently. \u00a0\n\u201cThe first season couldn\u2019t be any more than a dream season,\u201d Dever-Boaz said. \u201cBut in the last half of the second season, there was so much stress on everyone.\u201d\nStrong chemistry and a unique environment \nWilson\u2019s plan for bringing professional softball to the Washington region actually started a year earlier than he anticipated. National Pro Fastpitch wanted to quickly replace a team that had left the league, the Connecticut Braketts, so Wilson was asked to create the Glory by the start of the next season.\nThe next 45 days were filled with the process of forming the team. Finding a place to play was easy; Wilson struck a deal with GMU, which immediately got to work installing lights and stadium seating at one of its softball fields. \nWilson said he was running at \u201cMach Three\u201d to get the team going, but he took his time to find the right players.\n\u201cI wanted us to be real particular about the types of people the players would be,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just their physical capability in softball. It was also about who they were and if they were willing to give back to the community.\u201d\nEstablishing a presence in the community was a common goal for many fastpitch teams, according to former catcher Germaine Fairchild, who had been in the league since 1998 before joining the Glory through a supplemental draft. \nAt its best, the effort felt a little forced with other teams. But it was different with the Glory, Fairchild said. It actually felt real.\n\u201cWith other teams, it was just sitting at some tables in a shopping mall,\u201d Fairchild said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really engaging. The spirit was a little more genuine with the Glory.\u201d\nThe team hosted regular clinics that offered the chance for younger players to learn from professional players. But the clinics also gave them a chance to build a rapport with the Glory\u2019s players and provided role models in the sport.\nFAIRFAX, Virginia \u2013 Fans crowd the stands at one of the Washington Glory home games at George Mason University. (Photo courtesy of Paul Wilson)\n\u201cThere was no better feeling,\u201d former shortstop Amber Jackson said of working with younger players. \u201cIt was so special. You\u2019re now a role model for these kids. It was a great thing for some of them who thought they couldn\u2019t play after college.\u201d\nPlayers were encouraged to interact with the fans, who were highly engaged and interested in the game. Players sat in the stands, rather than the dugout, between innings to create a more personal relationship between athletes and the fan base. \nThat was exactly what Wilson wanted to do.\n\u201cWe told the ladies before they even signed a contract that it was important for us to have a fun, family-oriented atmosphere,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd there were a lot of dedicated fans who were invested in what was happening on the field as well as the ladies\u2019 lives.\u201d\nFrom a talent perspective, Dever-Boaz wanted a team that had speed and power. The team played in multiple, five-game series throughout the season, so pitching was also a top priority. \n\u201cThe team we created was so well-balanced,\u201d Dever-Boaz said. \u201cWe were looking for that speed and power, and we had that. We had a lot of home-run hitters. We were just a well-balanced team.\u201d\nPlayers from as far as California made the trip to Northern Virginia two weeks before the season began. But in a short amount of time, the team clicked and built a strong chemistry.\nThat was helped by the fact that the players did almost everything together. They visited local restaurants after every home game. Most of the players couldn\u2019t permanently move to the area because of full-time jobs in other areas, so during the season they lived in dorms at GMU, paid for by the team.\n\u201cIt was just like college,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe created an environment where we could have fun off the field. It felt like we were invited into the family.\u201d\nSo when the team started winning, it just made sense to the players.\n\u201cThere was definitely a kind spiritual element, if you will, to the fan base and the team,\u201d Fairchild said. \u201cIt was as much a close-knit family atmosphere as you were going to get.\u201d\nNo stands, no money\nBut as the 2008 season began, the players had a problem: they weren\u2019t getting paid.\nProfessional softball players generally do not receive much compensation. At the time, each team had a $100,000 salary cap. The Glory\u2019s pitching staff made the most money, but the majority of players earned between $2,500 and $5,000 for a three-month season. \nNow, that small but important amount of money was not coming in anymore.\nPlayers from the Washington Glory celebrate their National Pro Fastpitch Championship in 2007. (Photo courtesy of Sol Tucker)\n\u201cSome of those girls were playing six weeks without being paid,\u201d Dever-Boaz said. \nWhile Wilson did not recall checks getting paid that late, he admitted that checks came late on two occasions. Plans for a bridge loan did not go as planned, and the team was \u201ctapped out at that point,\u201d Wilson said.\nIn one instance that Wilson vividly remembers, the former owner drove to Philadelphia where the team was playing and told them personally that their checks would be late. \nHe offered any player who wanted to quit the team the permission to do so. But the players decided to stay.\nTo make matters worse, the team could no longer play at George Mason. The public university school system had to help pay for the $48.2 million in bills that had accumulated because of the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, meaning budgets at all state universities, including GMU, were affected.\nSo, the team had to play at Westfield Softball Complex, located at Westfield High School in Fairfax, Virginia, meaning the team could not stay in the dorms at GMU.\n\u201cWe really became a close unit then,\u201d Dever-Boaz said. \u201cWe had nothing else but each other to really rely on.\u201d\nThe team\u2019s living arrangements had to be moved to hotel suites where they had access to kitchens in their rooms. But finding money for basic needs was still an issue, according to team photographer Sol Tucker, because he often helped players pay for food.\n\u201cThey could no longer afford to even live,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cAnd these are our personal friends, so we fed them and hooked them up. But I couldn\u2019t believe that he (Wilson) would do that to them.\u201d\nBut Wilson was also having his own personal issue to deal with as well. Wilson didn\u2019t have a business partner, so he was paying for most of the expenses out of pocket. That money began to run low, too, meaning one of the last proverbial pillars that was stabilizing the franchise was gone.\nUltimately, Wilson said, he underestimated the costs of owning a professional team. He didn\u2019t foresee the challenges that came with getting sponsorship revenue for advertising and television revenue. And there were other costs like putting up lights at GMU\u2019s field that ended up being too expensive for the team to afford.\n\u201cThe operating costs were about what expected,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt was more about the ability to create the revenue around some of the sponsorship and advertising and trying to fill the stadium so quickly.\u201d\nEventually, the team could not afford to pay its debts and Wilson said he filed for bankruptcy. \u00a0\u00a0But he lost more than just a franchise.\n\u201cWe lost our house and cars after all that happened,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt was a good learning experience. I wouldn\u2019t say that I wish I hadn\u2019t done it. It was a phenomenal experience. But it was tough for a couple of years after that.\u201d\nThe team lost the stands shortly after the move from GMU because it couldn\u2019t afford them, which was a blow to the fan base. The team\u2019s following was not as strong as it was at GMU, and the loss of the stands affected it even more.\n\u201cIt was a heartache at that point because we knew it was the end of the franchise,\u201d Dever-Boaz said. \u201cAnd it was really sad for us at that point because there was a core of us that had become exceedingly close.\u201d\nAfter it became clear the Glory could not be financed, the National Pro Fastpitch league took control of the team. Although there were some talks with a potential buyer to keep the team in the area, that effort was unsuccessful and the team collapsed.\nNational Pro Fastpitch Commissioner Cheri Kempf refused to comment on the team, other than to say the Glory became insolvent and became unable from a financial standpoint to continue operations. \nAlthough the team was defunct, the players\u2019 contracts were sold to the newly-organized USSSA Pride for the following season. Most didn\u2019t stay with the team, though. Dever-Boaz had recently stepped down from her position to spend more time with her family, as she originally planned two years earlier.\nJackson left shortly after moving to the Pride to pursue a career in coaching. Fairchild had left the previous year and is now coaching Division I softball herself.\nBut the players and coach still remember the team fondly. They still have good memories of those two years, even after the team went from being an integral part of their lives to a small piece of their careers in a span of months.\n\u201cIt was a wonderful dream to bring a team into the community like that,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the right timing. And looking back\u2026if some things had happened differently, we probably could have been able to stick around.\u201d",

The team's establishment coincides with growing youth hockey participation in Maryland and the Washington Capitals' Stanley Cup victory, creating new opportunities for young players to compete locally.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Quinn Warmuth knew he wanted to play college hockey since eighth grade.\nNow, the 19-year-old defenseman is making that dream a reality with the Maryland Black Bears junior hockey team \u2014 the first North American Hockey League team in the state.\nBut first, Warmuth, an Olmstead, Ohio, native and the Black Bears\u2019 captain, hopes to establish a winning culture at the Odenton-based team, helping plot a roadmap for future Maryland players to eventually play college hockey.\nIn April, the Black Bears became the 24th member of the Tier II junior hockey league, which features a highly competitive brand of hockey for 16- to 21-year-olds who aspire to play collegiately. The league has produced several National Hockey League All-Stars in its 42-year history, including Phil Kessel of the Pittsburgh Penguins, and the Chicago Blackhawks\u2019 Patrick Kane.\nThe Black Bears arrived at a critical time for local hockey. Youth hockey participation in Maryland has trended upward in the last three seasons, topping 10,000 players for the second consecutive year, according to USA Hockey. The team will fill the gap between youth hockey and the college ranks, providing local talent with the opportunity to play competitively close to home.\n\u201cWe\u2019re put in a unique (position) where we can dictate what the future holds for this place,\u201d said Warmuth, the Black Bears\u2019 team captain. \u201cKids now from Maryland can play hockey here. They\u2019re never really going to have to leave home for the first time, which is really nice and a unique opportunity that they didn\u2019t have before.\u201d\nIn June, the Washington Capitals won the franchise\u2019s first Stanley Cup, which could further bolster participation, said Black Bears Head Coach and General Manager Clinton Mylymok. Mylymok called the timing of starting a junior hockey team the same year as the Capitals winning the Cup \u201cthe perfect storm.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you win like that to create the buzz, it\u2019s not just for us it\u2019s for the sport in general,\u201d Mylymok said. \u201cYou tend to see more people coming out to watch a game or also maybe learn to play the game.\u201d\nMaryland Black Bears winger and associate captain Connor Pooley takes a faceoff against Wilkes-Barre/Scranton during their North American Hockey League game at Piney Orchard Ice Arena in Odenton, Maryland, on Friday Nov. 30, 2018. (Photo by Brooks DuBose/Capital News Service)\nKevin Erlenbach, the assistant executive director of membership at USA Hockey, said the growth in player registration \u2014 mainly among players ages 8 and younger \u2014 will continue in the DC metro area for several years.\n\u201cEspecially the year after (a Cup win) you will see a surge in new players,\u201d Erlenbach said. \u201cThat wave rides for a while because there\u2019s a jump in retention because it\u2019s a bigger pool.\u201d\nMylymok and the players said the stands at home games \u2014 the team plays at Piney Orchard Arena, the Capital\u2019s former practice center in Odenton \u2014 are filled with fans decked out in red, white and blue Caps gear.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopefully filling the void for some people \u2026 it\u2019s not the NHL but it\u2019s really good hockey,\u201d Mylymok said.\nFriday night was no different, as about 300 fans crowded into the arena on Ugly Sweater Night to cheer on the Black Bears against Wilkes Barre/Scranton Knights. Though the team looked sharp in their Maryland flag-bedazzled alternate uniforms, they fell 6-3, dropping to 7-13-3-2 and fourth place in the East Division.\n\u201cThe fans have been great. We\u2019re getting great turnouts,\u201d Warmuth said. \u201cI think if we start winning even more I think more people are gonna come. This being our first year we\u2019re all pretty happy with the type of environment that we\u2019re playing in.\u201d\nAbout halfway through their inaugural season, the Black Bears have hit a rough patch, losing four straight and eight of their last 10, but Mylymok\u2019s mantra remains the same: play with desperation and intensity night-to-night.\n\u201cWin at all costs is great, but I like to win with the right people,\u201d Mylymok said. \u201cI like to develop kids and move them on. I like to develop them as people. I don\u2019t want to sell my soul to win a championship.\u201d\nSince junior hockey is a preparatory league, rosters can see significant turnover year-to-year, which requires Mylymok to coach like it\u2019s a Division I program, he said, holding workouts and film sessions to simulate what players will experience in college, and even throwing pop quizzes to test players\u2019 knowledge.\n\u201cIt forces you every day to make sure that you\u2019re doing everything to make yourself (better),\u201d Warmuth said. \u201cJunior hockey is all about development so that when you get to the next level there are no surprises.\u201d\nEach Black Bears player is hosted by a local family \u2014 known as billets \u2014 which provide living accommodations, transportation and anything else players may need. In exchange, the families, who live in towns like Severn, Crownsville and Davidsonville, receive financial compensation from the team.\nMylymok called billets \u201cthe most important thing\u201d outside of a strong ownership group to running a successful junior hockey team.\n\u201cThese are young teenagers that need a comfortable place to be,\u201d Mylymok said. \u201cWhen you have a poor billet and you have distractions, it affects their play directly. Honestly, you can tell if the kid\u2019s having a tough time at home or there\u2019s an issue with their play.\u201d\nMaryland Black Bears players fight for the puck along the boards against Wilkes-Barre/Scranton during their North American Hockey League game at Piney Orchard Ice Arena in Odenton, Maryland, on Friday, Nov. 30, 2018 (Photo by Brooks DuBose/Capital News Service)\nWarmuth is hosted by a family in Crofton. Forward and Chicago native Matteo Menotti, 19, stays in Annapolis, and winger Connor Pooley, 20, another Ohioan, stays in Ellicott City.\nThe trio described their billets as comfortable, living in nice houses and regularly taking part in downtime activities like yachting, attended sporting events and flying lessons.\nWhile they\u2019re here, Warmuth, Pooley and Menotti said they are focused on dominating, winning and, above all, having fun playing junior hockey.\n\u201cWe get to chase our dreams,\u201d Pooley said. \u201cWhere a lot of my buddies are headed off to school and they\u2019re gonna be getting a job shortly. \u2026 For us, we get to live the dream for a little bit longer.\u201d\nMylymok has compiled a diverse roster that includes players from 12 different states and others coming from as far away as South Korea, Great Britain and Germany. And while there isn\u2019t a Maryland-based player on the roster, the goal is to bring local players into the fold, Mylymok said, with one caveat: \u201cThey have to be able to play.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take Maryland kids but they got to be the right ones,\u201d Mylymok said. \u201cI want the guys that represent Maryland in the right way to be here.\u201d\nIn late November, the team took a step toward cultivating local talent by signing an 18-year-old goalie, Andrew Takacs, a native of Dunkirk, to a tender for the 2019-20 season.\nTakacs previously played for a Black Bears affiliate, Team Maryland, and has already suited up for the junior hockey team this season, filling in as a backup for an injured goalie on a weekend road trip.\n\u201cWith Andrew \u2026 we knew what we were getting in terms of character, off-ice work ethic, his maturity. He\u2019s just a kid that represents the local area really well,\u201d Mylymok said. \u201cIt was a no-brainer for us.\u201d\nTakacs said he was \u201cbeyond stoked\u201d when he heard the Black Bears had tendered him.\n\u201cThis is the perfect move for me in terms of next year (getting) the development to grow so that I can make it to the Division I level,\u201d Takacs said.\nTakacs attends Gilmour Academy in Ohio, where he will graduate in May. With the Black Bears in the area, Takacs will now have an opportunity to come back and represent his home state.\n\u201cJust to know that you are part of the movement towards making hockey a greater thing in Maryland is really special,\u201d Takacs said. \u201cKids will even start believing \u2018I don\u2019t have to go somewhere else in the country so that I can play high-level hockey.\u2019 \u2026 This is going to put Maryland hockey on the map.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Jacksonville shooting at a Madden 19 tournament has heightened concerns among gamers about safety at events, leading to calls for tighter security measures. Despite the industry's rapid growth and significant revenue, smaller tournaments often lack adequate security, prompting organizers and competitors to advocate for improved protocols.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The August shooting at a Madden 19 tournament in Jacksonville that left two people dead and nine wounded continued to linger in gamers\u2019 minds as they traveled to Washington to compete in the Red Bull Conquest Finals this weekend.\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m a little skeptical about events,\u201d Marcus Redmond, who will be competing in the tournament as one of three finalists from Illinois, told Capital News Service. \u201cWhen I go to events, I always pray. I pray right before the event and while I\u2019m at the event. Because you never know (what could happen).\u201d\nThe tournament, which will be held at the Entertainment and Sports Arena, will feature 45 of the top gamers in fighting games like Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition, TEKKEN 7 and Guilty Gear Xrd REV2. \nThe shooting has caused competitors and event organizers in the gaming industry to call for tighter security at tournaments. While larger events have guards and metal detectors, others like the venue where the shooting took place have been more lax in their measures, with little to no security at all.\nProfessional video game leagues and tournaments, also known as eSports, are one of the fastest-growing industries in the country. Newzoo, a market research company specializing in the gaming industry, reported $655 million in revenue in 2017 and predicted the industry to cross $1 billion in 2019, according to a February story in Forbes. \nTournaments like the Red Bull Conquest Finals are often held in front of large audiences and feature cash prizes.\nSpectators watch at the Red Bull Conquest Qualifier held at The Garage at Tech Square in Atlanta on Sept. 8, 2018. (Photo courtesy of Red Bull)\nEvents DC hosted 2,000 people for a tournament held in January at the D.C. Armory, and chairman Max Brown said in a statement that the company\u2019s partnership with Red Bull will be \u201canother step forward in cementing D.C. as the capital of eSports.\u201d\nBut other tournaments that do not draw thousands of people have a mixed level quality of security, according to participants. While events organized by major companies have top-notch procedures that include wands and metal detectors, smaller tournaments offer little inspection for spectators and participants.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen both extremes,\u201d Spero Gineros, of Knoxville, Tennessee, who has been competing professionally for 17 years, told CNS. \u201cI\u2019ve seen everything from no security to metal detectors and thoroughly searching bags. Then I\u2019ve seen security where they\u2019re just letting people through. They\u2019re barely wanding people and opening their bags quickly and keeping them moving.\u201d\nGineros, who won first place at Red Bull\u2019s regional tournament in Atlanta, added that the level of security depends on who the host company hires and how much they pay.\nThe winner of Tekken poses for a portrait at the Red Bull Conquest Qualifier held at The Garage at Tech Square in Atlanta on Sept. 8, 2018. (Photo courtesy of Red Bull)\n\u201cYou can pay $500 for the weekend or you can pay $5,000 for the weekend and get more top-notch stuff,\u201d he said.\nStill, the Jacksonville shooting grabbed the attention of organizers for high-profile tournaments. Electronic Arts (E.A.) cancelled the remainder of the Madden tournament, while CEO Andrew Wilson said in a statement the company was \u201cdeeply affected by what took place in Jacksonville.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had to confront something like this as an organization, and I believe the first time our gaming community has dealt with a tragedy of this nature,\u201d Wilson said.\nRedmond said he used to feel like tournaments were a gamer\u2019s safe haven, but the shooting left him \u201cshocked.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we can go to play and you don\u2019t have to worry about any of that,\u201d Redmond said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Thank God,\u2019 because that could have been at an event I was at.\u201d\nHours after the shooting, Joey Cuellar, tournament director for Evolution Championship Series, another eSports event centered on fighting games, tweeted that the tragedy made it clear that \u201cwe need to be more proactive for 2019 and beyond.\u201d\nSecurity was bolstered at EVO\u2019s tournament in Las Vegas this year with undercover law enforcement. Cuellar added in the tweet that there will be metal detectors at all EVO events in 2019.\nRed Bull did not immediately respond to questions about its security measures, but participants in the company\u2019s regional qualifying events said they were pleased with the quality of security. \n\u201cThey were good,\u201d Gineros said. \u201cThey really looked through the bags, and everything seemed good. They seemed like they did a good job.\u201d\nAs far as the quality of security for smaller tournaments, participants still have different experiences. Generos, who has been competing in tournaments since he was 14 years old, said he\u2019s used to a lack of security at events, while Redmon feels the quality of security has gotten more strict since the shooting.\n\u201cThe security varies from event to event because each event has different organizers,\u201d Redmond said. \u201cBut I will say the overall theme is that they have good security.\u201d\n-30-",

The experience of sudden fame varied among competitors, with some adjusting more easily than others to the recognition and success following their appearances on the show.",
    "content": "It was 5 a.m. when Geoff Britten grabbed the thick red rope that hung from the top of the metal structure that was Mt. Midoriyama, his eyes looking skyward at the prize. He had been competing all evening, and the night had finally reached its climax.\nThe instructions were simple: climb the rope to the top of the mountain and Britten, of Olney, Maryland, would be the first American to complete all four stages on NBC\u2019s American version of the popular Japanese obstacle course, \u201cNinja Warrior.\u201d The only problem was that he had to climb the 75-foot long rope in just 30 seconds. \nBritten, then 36, hit the buzzer at the top of the mountain with less than a second left on the clock.\n\u201cIt was definitely something that was very important to me,\u201d Britten, who completed Stage Four in his second season, told Capital News Service. \u201cI trained really hard that year for it. I almost had a feeling I was going to do it.\u201d \nBritten was denied winning the $1 million prize when Isaac Caldiero, the only other competitor to reach Stage Four in Season 7, reached the buzzer faster. Still, it was a unique accomplishment for Britten, a former cameraman. And like climbing Mt. Midoriyama, the weeks and months after Britten\u2019s achievement were unfamiliar territory.\n\u201cNinja Warrior\u201d athletes, also known as ninjas, experience the success and attention from appearing on the American version of the show in different ways, and the way they handle it varies. \nNinja hopefuls send in submission videos and line up for weeks to participate in the show\u2019s city qualifiers. The competitors who make the cut advance to the city finals and then the national finals in Las Vegas. \nMany of the contestants who make one or two appearances on the show return home to a few claps on the back and conversations with friends. Some of the more popular ninjas who regularly return to compete make it an integral part of their lives.\nFor Britten, being the center of attention was an adjustment. He had to deal with consistent recognition from fans of the show congratulating him and wanting to talk. Eventually, it escalated to the point where being out in public became a hindrance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to be that person,\u201d Britten said. \u201cI\u2019m not someone who ever wanted to be famous or be in the spotlight. I accept it, I deal with it well. But it\u2019s not something I seek out actively.\u201d\nWhile Britten announced he was taking time off from competing after Season 8, he wasn\u2019t completely done with \u201cNinja Warrior.\u201d Shortly after his announcement, ATS, the company that builds the obstacle courses seen on the show for NBC, reached out to Britten wanting him to be a tester. His background in television and obstacle courses created a good fit.\n\u201cThat was a whole other world to me, and I really enjoyed it,\u201d Britten said. \u201cI got to work with the producers on obstacle difficulty, trying to make the courses doable for a certain amount of people. I think I was a huge asset for them that year.\u201d\nNow, Britten is expanding his knowledge of the sport while also making it more accessible. Working with current and former ninjas, Britten helped start Ninja Nation, a company dedicated to building gyms for ninja hopefuls of all ages.\n\u201cOur goal is to build 100 gyms,\u201d Britten said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to expand access to this growing sport. It\u2019s grown into having multiple leagues, multiple tours. We want to create a professional environment where parents feel safe bringing their kids.\u201d\nThe expansion of the sport has allowed athletes like former gymnast Barclay Stockett, of Dayton, Texas, to thrive after their former athletic careers end. Prior to making her \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d debut in Season 8, Stockett participated in Team Ninja Warrior \u2014 a relay version of the obstacle course \u2014 where she found the community she had been searching for since competing in gymnastics. \n\u201cI found my new sense of place,\u201d Stockett said in a CNS interview. \u201cWhen I quit gymnastics in my senior year of high school, I felt like my athletic career was over. It was like I was in a season of mourning, and it took a long time to find my identity as a person without being an athlete. By the time I found Ninja Warrior\u2026I was really in a healthy mindset to try something new.\u201d\nBarclay Stockett (center) swings from rings at a climbing gym while fellow competitors cheer her on (photo courtesy of John. Cachero)\nStockett was well known in the ninja community before appearing on the show, but she skyrocketed in popularity after Season 9. It\u2019s still a new experience for her, especially when she gets recognized in unlikely places.\n\u201cI was in front of the Louvre (in Paris)\u2026and this couple came up to me and said, \u2018Oh my gosh, you\u2019re Barclay Stockett,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey knew my name, and I was completely blown away by that.\u201d\nSince April of 2017, Stockett has been working alongside the U.S. Air Force for Alpha Warrior, a company that provides obstacle-based training to branches of the U.S. military. Her work has taken her to \u201caround 30 bases\u201d across the world, including in Italy, Germany and South Korea. \n\u201cIt was so cool because whenever I was looking for something different\u2026I was praying that I would find a job that allowed me to travel, involved a little less time working and allowed athletics and ninja (training) if possible,\u201d she said. \nFor others who compete in \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior,\u201d like Bethesda, Maryland, sprint canoeist Gavin Ross, success on the course doesn\u2019t lead to new careers or inspire them to expand the sport. But it does give them a unique experience that adds to their training for other sports. \nRoss had been a fan of Ninja Warrior since it debuted in Japan before coming to the United States, and competing was always something he wanted to do. But because there weren\u2019t a lot of ninja gyms near him, he wasn\u2019t able to train as much as expected.\nGavin Ross trains trains as a member of the Washington Canoe club. Ross intensified his training when preparing for \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior.\u201d (Photo courtesy of Cathy Kasperbauer)\n\u201cWhen I found out I was going to compete (in the qualifying course), I didn\u2019t do much training specific to ninja for that,\u201d Ross told CNS. \u201cI just started paddling again and started working on my grip strength.\u201d\nRoss added pull ups and dead hangs to his workout. He also placed pool noodles on the bars and handles in the gym that made him work harder to close his hands. But when Ross qualified to compete in Las Vegas for the national finals, he made weekly trips to ninja gyms.\nRoss is a new face to many fans of the show, so he isn\u2019t as recognizable as much as Britten or Stockett yet. He often gets contacted by old high school friends who knew how much he loved the sport. But he does get approached by strangers from time to time who say they know him.\n\u201cThere were a few people who I had no idea who they were,\u201d Ross said with a laugh. \u201cSo I just had to act like I did. They were calling me by name, and when that happen you just assume you\u2019ve met them before.\u201d\nRegardless of the level of success ninjas experience from the show, many believe it is a rewarding part of their lives. \nBritten was reminded of that after failing on Stage One in Season 8. He emerged from the water with a smile on his face and said two words: \u201cEverybody falls.\u201d He received more than 1,000 letters from parents thanking him for what he said. \n\u201cI got more kudos falling with grace than I did doing well with style,\u201d Britten said. \u201cI thought it was indicative of why \u2018Ninja Warrior\u2019 is so great. People look at it as a physical challenge, but it\u2019s also a role model and great teacher.\u201d",

If previous relocations are any indicator, these teams can expect to dramatically increase their wins in the next five seasons.\nOf the 16 relocations, only four teams had a lower winning percentage after the move. And seven teams won championships within five years of their move, compared with three before.\n\nBoth the Baltimore Ravens and the current Washington NFL franchise relocated from other cities. Washington \u2014 formerly the Boston Braves \u2014 moved to the district in 1937 and won a championship that same season. The team also had the greatest increase in win percentage, jumping from .465 to .700.\nThe Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore and became the Ravens in 1996, 12 years after the Colts infamously left Baltimore in the middle of the night for Indianapolis. The Ravens average win percentage was practically identical to the Browns\u2019 before the move, but they took home the Lombardi Trophy in their fifth season in Baltimore.",

    "content": "[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 NBA team Twitter accounts have tapped into the social zeitgeist in a way that sets them apart from sports franchises in other leagues. \u00a0That\u2019s not an accident.\n\nRead more of our coverage of NBA Twitter\n\nOn Twitter, creative, meme-filled conversations help NBA stand out\nThe hidden Twitter relationships of NBA teams\nThe top eight moments in NBA Twitter history\n\n\nA group of social media managers fluent in Internet culture and meme-speak, operating largely independently, have helped set the tone. \u00a0Capital News Service interviewed five of them to learn how the team accounts are run. \nHow did you get in charge of running (NBA Team\u2019s) Twitter account?\n\u201cI was hired by the 76ers in 2015. Before being hired, I worked for NBC Sports Philadelphia (formerly CSN) as their social media manager and before that I worked / interned at a handful of smaller agencies in Philadelphia,\u201d said Philadelphia 76ers Senior Social Media Manager Kurt Gies.\n\u201cI started my career in managing social media and digital channels for a group of local radio stations here in Indianapolis. Then, I moved to Pacers Sports & Entertainment to run social media for Bankers Life Fieldhouse and the WNBA team, Indiana Fever. After a year in that position, I transitioned to Pacers social media, where I\u2019ve been running our accounts for five years,\u201d said Indiana Pacers Director of Digital Marketing Celeste Ballou.\nWhat is it like interacting with another team of Twitter?\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun \u2013 a lot of the NBA social people know each other and there are a lot of great people doing great things around league. Fans always like it when the teams interact.\u201d said Detroit Pistons Social Media Director Doug Wernert.\n\u201cMost of our interactions are spur of the moment and have to do with what\u2019s happening in the game. Some teams plan in advance with other team social media managers,\u201d said Gies, of the 76ers.\nWhat is your personal favorite tweet or conversation your account has had?\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to pick a favorite, but I think the coolest content that I have captured that went viral was Vince Carter hitting a half-court shot & then doing a between the legs dunk during his pregame warmups when we were on the road. You never know what you\u2019re going to capture and it was cool that I was in the right place at the right time to capture a legend doing that,\u201d said Social Media Producer Amara Baptist for the Memphis Grizzlies when this interview was conducted in April. She now works for the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nJust a casual between-the-legs dunk. Nbd. \nCOME ON, @mrvincecarter15! This is insane. pic.twitter.com/uQsNyVLTdl\n\u2014 Memphis Grizzlies (@memgrizz) March 21, 2017\n\n\u201cMy favorite conversation with another team was with Atlanta earlier this season. We had already beat them twice and they tweeted at one of our fans who was excited to get tickets to the game that they should be hawks fans instead. after a few tweets exchanged back and forth I finally sent them a screenshot of the standings (we were first, they were last in the conference). That\u2019s probably the riskiest I\u2019ve been tweeting at another team but it was fun and didn\u2019t go too far,\u201d said Boston Celtics Head of Strategic Marketing Kara Hutchinson.\u00a0\n\n? pic.twitter.com/uBzAlBLx1w\n\u2014 Boston Celtics (@celtics) November 10, 2017\n\n\u201cA couple years ago, a lot of the teams got together over the summer and did some fun hashtags and Photoshops around different topics like #NBAMovies or #NBACereals. People really got into that. Just from our account, it would probably be the Jumpman video we created for Andre Drummond for All-Star voting,\u201d said Wernert, of the Pistons.\n\nAnd now, thanks to Toronto's own @Drake, a message from President @BarackObama \u2026\nRT #NBAVote Andre Drummondhttps://t.co/5s0VHNI0YL\n\u2014 Detroit Pistons (@DetroitPistons) January 5, 2016\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been too much to remember in my time here, but I love being the first account to showcase a big play or funny GIF from our guys and seeing it go viral. Victor Oladipo\u2019s head shaking meme this season was one of the favorites from the past year,\u201d said Ballou, of the Pacers.\n\nWhen Victor Oladipo sees you haven't voted to send him to the All-Star Game.\nRetweets count as votes! #NBAVote pic.twitter.com/yKR7mZpo3d\n\u2014 Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) January 9, 2018\n\n\u201cThe best conversation we\u2019ve probably had with another team is when the Sacramento Kings asked to swap picks (we had 1 and they had a much lower pick) and we responded with \u2018New phone who dis?\u2019\u201d said Gies, of the 76ers.\n\n.@SacramentoKings New phone who dis\n\u2014 Philadelphia 76ers (@sixers) May 18, 2016\n\nWhich teams do you like conversing with? Which teams do you not converse with?\n\u201cTypically I don\u2019t start anything with other teams but if they tweet at me I\u2019ll often respond, so it really isn\u2019t a matter of who I will/won\u2019t respond to, just mostly whether the topic is a good fit and we can maintain our brand voice throughout the conversation,\u201d said Hutchinson, of the Celtics.\n\u201cThey all have their different styles & it\u2019s really fun to talk to them all, but I personally like to interact with the Jazz, Trail Blazers, Hawks & Kings!\u201d said Baptist formerly of the Grizzlies.\nWhat is the typical process of creating a tweet for your team?\n\u201cI\u2019m in charge of all the tweets so I have a content plan for what we want to communicate. I have access to photos and videos and templates and assets from our creative team and then I draft the copy (or use copy if it\u2019s provided) and send it out,\u201d said Wernert, of the Pistons.\n\u201cIt depends on the situation, but in-game usually it\u2019s going with the flow of what is happening in the game. I\u2019ll live tweet plays, use gifs if one of our players starts to score a lot of points & post video highlights. On non-game days, we have sponsored content & other off-day content that we need to post so I\u2019ll go from there depending on what is on my schedule,\u201d said Baptist, formerly of the Grizzlies.\nHow is the account typically managed? How many people run the account? How does a tweet get approved?\n\u201cThe account is mainly me and one other person that also helps with our Web site. There\u2019s not really an approval process \u2013 I may run something by our PR staff or Community Relations staff or partnerships team depending on what it is, but for the most part, I\u2019m the approval process,\u201d said Wernert, of the Pistons.\n\u201cI am the only one who is running our account currently. I usually do not need to have a tweet approved because I have the trust of the organization. If I do have a question about a tweet that is borderline risky however, I\u2019ll text my boss & get their opinion before I post it,\u201d said Baptist formerly of the Grizzlies.\nDoes your account have a particular style or personality?\n\u201cWe just try to be reflective of our brand but have a little more fun with it. As a very traditional/historic brand, one of my main challenges is toying the line between being youthful and fun and a little risky with maintaining our championship-caliber attitude. We won\u2019t do cheesy gimmicks because our audience sees right through that and frankly is more interested in the basketball component than smaller market teams might be dealing with,\u201d said Hutchinson, of the Celtics.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve traditionally been a bit more straight-laced with less of a personality in past years and that was mainly dictated by our Basketball department. With changes in the front office in the past year, we\u2019ve been able to open up and have a bit more fun, which is the whole point of social media. We use our account to share that of our midwestern pride, embracing the underdog persona, and toe the line of being sarcastic/playful. We know there are teams that are far more edgy than us, but that\u2019s not the persona that we\u2019re seeking for the Pacers,\u201d said Ballou, of the Pacers.\nHow do you think the culture of NBA Twitter has evolved in the last few years? Does how other teams act impact how your account acts?\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost become a culture in itself, constantly pushing the envelope and finding new ways to keep it fresh and interesting. I always am looking at other teams to see what they\u2019re doing that\u2019s new that we could consider adopting or looking for ideas on ways to improve what we\u2019re already doing,\u201d said Hutchinson, of the Celtics.\n\u201cThe culture of NBA Twitter has evolved so much within the last few years. It is the leader in how people find out information about the team, what happened in a game & you can always count on teams to be the first to comment on a trending topic with something witty. It will only continue to grow as technology changes & evolves,\u201d said Baptist formerly of the Grizzlies.\n\u201cThe shift has gone from live tweeting play by play to being more of a second screen or the feeling of watching the game with a fellow fan. We still post top highlights but we\u2019ve moved away from play-by-play on our Twitter account. We definitely watch others teams to see what kind of content or even just copy is working for them and see where we can use it ourselves. We also get daily reports with rankings and interactions across social channels so we can see how we\u2019re performing, compared to teams across the league,\u201d said Ballou for the Pacers.\nWhat do you think makes the NBA Twitter community so fun and popular?\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. The teams have fun with it and try to relate to their fan base on personal levels. I like adopting the voice of the fan as the voice of the team and I think that helps keep the community so fun and popular,\u201d said Hutchinson, of the Celtics.\n\u201cIt seems like fans of the NBA and the players themselves are definitely the most vocal on social media, so when you\u2019re watching a game & tweeting about it, it feels like you are with a bunch of your friends at a sports bar watching it together. Fans really feel like they are a part of the conversation & Twitter gives them a direct way to contact their favorite teams & athletes,\u201d said Baptist formerly of the Grizzlies.\nDoes how your team performs impact how you tweet?\n\u201cIn some aspects, definitely. Being self-aware is a big part of social media and while there\u2019s things to highlight during poor performances, over-tweeting could and usual does receive backlash from followers,\u201d said Gies, of the 76ers.\n\u201cCertainly. There will be subtle differences between how we tweet a huge loss, a narrow win, to a come-from-behind victory. The tone will be a bit different if we\u2019re on a 6-game losing streak compared to a win streak. Sometimes, our job is to give fans hope or remind them why they\u2019re fans of the team. Sometimes we have to acknowledge that the team didn\u2019t meet expectations, and other times we have a different kind of confidence and build our fan base even further by highlighting things that are going really well,\u201d said Ballou, of the Pacers.\nHow does tweeting change in-season versus out-of-season?\n\u201cWithout the games, the focus goes more to the draft, free agency, Summer League and any other moves we might make. We don\u2019t have as much access to players so we have to look for other ways to tell our story,\u201d said Wernert, of the Pistons.\n\u201cWith no games in the offseason, we need to come up with compelling content that our fans will enjoy that is outside of the typical live tweeting of games. During the season there is constant content every day i.e. game highlights, game previews & recaps, practice content, twitter takeovers etc. We have a lot more access to do things with players during the season as well,\u201d said Baptist formerly of the Grizzlies.\nWhat are your plans for the future of your account? \n\u201cAt this point we just want to make sure we\u2019re constantly looking ahead and keeping the account fun and light. We\u2019re going through a transition internally this year/in the next few years on really forming a voice/identity, something organizationally we didn\u2019t put much of a focus on previously,\u201d said Hutchinson, of the Celtics.\n\u201cWe definitely think we\u2019ll push a more playful attitude as we continue. This season was the first step for us, and we look to further establish our voice while also creating new and unique content that our fans may not even expect. We have the greatest access to our players and I hope to continue to find fun angles to share their stories and personalities with our fans,\u201d said Ballou, of the Pacers.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]",

The clever way the Atlanta Hawks tracked a winning streak.\nIn 2015, the Hawks went on an epic run of 19 wins in a row, the fifth longest winning streak in NBA history at the time. At some point during the run, they began to add a W to their name on Twitter for each win.\n(screenshot via SBNation.com)\nBy the time the Hawks hit 19, they had had already surpassed the character limit for a Twitter account name that was in place at the time.\n3. The Sacramento Kings gave the Cleveland Cavaliers a new logo.\nAfter defeating the Cavaliers in overtime in January 2017, the Sacramento Kings rubbed it in with a photoshopped version of the Cavs logo that replaced the traditional \u201cC\u201d with an \u201cL\u201d.\n\nThis one's for the Land\u2026 pic.twitter.com/GiJ2wSEoOZ\n\u2014 Sacramen2 Kings (@SacramentoKings) January 26, 2017\n\n4.\u00a0The Twitter fight that led the league to crack down on trash talk.\nAfter the Portland Trail Blazers poked fun at Memphis Grizzlies forward Chandler Parsons with a GIF of an airball he put up during a January 2017 game between the two teams, he taunted the Trail Blazers for their poor performance with this Tweet. \n\ngood luck in the lottery show this year\u270a?\n\u2014 Chandler Parsons (@ChandlerParsons) January 28, 2017\n\nThat led to this back and forth between Parsons and Trail Blazers player C.

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 With the NBA playoffs upon them, the Washington Wizards have been struggling to find answers to issues that have plagued the team all season.\nThe team has lost seven of its last 10 games and several of those losses were against lackluster teams with under-.500 records, including the New York Knicks, Chicago Bulls and Detroit Pistons.\nAfter a disappointing loss to the struggling Atlanta Hawks on Friday, Wizards head coach Scott Brooks heavily criticized the team for its lack of ball movement and creativity.\n\u201cSelfish basketball is no fun to coach, it\u2019s no fun to play with, and it\u2019s no fun to watch. We\u2019re a selfish basketball team right now,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to share the basketball, you can\u2019t just say \u2018John\u2019s not here.\u2019 John\u2019s here, it doesn\u2019t matter. We still got to play the right way.\u201d\nAll-star point guard John Wall didn\u2019t suit up against the Hawks and his absence was evident throughout the game. Center Marcin Gortat, who has averaged two assists this season, was the Wizards\u2019 assist leader that night with only four total assists.\nAlthough the team struggled to move the ball well against the Hawks, it hasn\u2019t been a consistent problem this season. The team\u2019s frustrating loss to Atlanta is really an outlier, because the Wizards have actually moved the ball well recently.\nOver the last five games, where the Wizards have gone 1-4, the team has averaged 27.2 assists per game, the seventh-best assist rate in the league. The team has also averaged an impressive 68.7 assist percentage, the third-best percentage in the NBA during that span.\nIt\u2019s evident that the Wizards are actually doing an efficient job of moving the ball lately, as nearly 70 percent of all their field goals have come right after a pass. However, the real problem for the team heading into the playoffs isn\u2019t necessarily ball movement, it\u2019s the turnovers that come from all those passes.\nOver the last five games, the Wizards have averaged 16.2 turnovers per game, the fourth- highest turnover rate in the league. The team has also averaged a 16.6 turnover percentage, the third-highest rate during this span. This means that the team is turning over the ball roughly 17 times per 100 plays.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a better job of moving the ball; looking for the extra pass, looking for the right pass, saving the home run passes,\u201d Wizards small forward Otto Porter Jr. said Friday. \u201cTurnovers are putting us in a bad position.\u201d\nBrooks also recognized a need for better effort from the team on defense. He mentioned that the Wizards made several mistakes against the Hawks that led to wide-open shots around the perimeter and in the paint.\nThe Wizards haven\u2019t been a great defensive team this year, but stats show they\u2019ve been regressing on the defensive side recently.\nThe team has allowed 111.2 points per 100 possessions over its last five games, the sixth-worst defensive rating in the league over that span. They\u2019ve also allowed 19.2 points off of turnovers, which is the fifth-highest rate in the league.\nWith the playoffs approaching, the team has to find a way to cut down on turnovers and play sharper defense on and off the ball. Players will have to step up on both ends of the court for the team to make a strong playoff run.\nWith a potential first-round playoff matchup against the red-hot Toronto Raptors or the resilient Boston Celtics, there\u2019s really no room for mistakes and the Wizards\u2019 players know it.\n\u201cWe are supposed to be playing great for the playoffs, improving in all things and now we\u2019re just struggling all over the floor,\u201d backup point guard Tomas Satoransky said after Friday\u2019s game. \u201cWe have to really change it quickly.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Washington Wizards have learned to pass the ball well without John Wall, but at the same time, their ball-handling mistakes underscore how much they miss the all-star guard.\nSince Wall went down with a knee injury in late January, the Wizards have played 17 games and won 11. During this span, the team has developed a knack for passing the ball.\nIn their last 15 games, the Wizards have put up an impressive 68.3 assist percentage, the second-highest percentage in the NBA behind only the Golden State Warriors. This means that nearly 70 percent of every field goal the Wizards made during that stretch came right after a pass.\nThe Wizards also have the fifth-highest assist per game rate this season, with a total of 24.6 assists per game as a team. In their last 15 games, however, the Wizards have passed the ball well enough for the third-best rate in the league, with 28.1 assists per game.\nThese are impressive statistics considering that Wall, the team\u2019s primary ball handler, has missed significant time this season and yet still leads the team in total assists.\nThe Wizards have managed to keep up this high-assist total without the all-star guard thanks to improved passing from both shooting guard Bradley Beal and Tomas Satoransky, who has taken up the role as the team\u2019s starting point guard in Wall\u2019s absence.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to always find the open man, trying to play smart, trying to move the ball,\u201d Satoransky told Capital News Service after the Wizards\u2019 loss to the Toronto Raptors on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re putting a lot of pressure on Brad so we try to cut, looking for the open man.\u201d\nWhile assists have gone up without Wall, the team has also been turning over the ball excessively. In their last 15 games, the Wizards have averaged 15.5 turnovers a game, the fifth-highest total in the league during that span.\nAlthough the Wizards picked up a narrow 117-113 win over the Miami Heat in overtime Tuesday night, the team allowed 19 turnovers that turned into 29 points for the Heat. It was a close game that the Wizards could have won in regulation had they not turned over the ball so much.\nThe team\u2019s struggle with turnovers has resulted in easier offense for opposing teams this season. During their last 15 games, the Wizards have allowed opponents to score 20.5 points off of turnovers, the second-highest total in the league behind the struggling Memphis Grizzlies.\n\u201cWe just need to be simple,\u201d Beal said in a statement. \u201cSometimes we try to make the home-run play or a play that\u2019s not there to get the assist, or whatever it may be.\u201d\nPart of the problem with the turnovers is that Wall was usually the player who took the ball up the court. He helped determine the flow of the offense, which is something Beal and Satoransky have been unable to do as effectively as Wall.\nWith the all-star guard still weeks away from returning to action, the Wizards will have to find a solution to their turnover problem soon. There are only 17 regular season games left and these games will help determine seeding when the playoffs start.\n\u201cAll we have to do is move the ball, share it and shoot it,\u201d Beal said. \u201cShoot it when you\u2019re open and if you don\u2019t shoot it when you\u2019re open, that\u2019s when the turnovers are allowed to happen.\u201d",

Carter called that ice-building process a \u201ctechnological marvel.\u201d\nRegardless of the temperature, this is a game players get excited for, Bondra said.\n\u201cIf I was a player, I would definitely circle the calendar,\u201d he said.\nAdded to the excitement of playing outdoors and playing at a military academy is a budding rivalry between the two teams, Capitals General Manager Brian MacLellan said.\n\u201cToronto\u2019s in the East and it\u2019s a good rivalry now since we had a playoff series with them last year,\u201d said MacLellan.\nIn tight races in both the Metropolitan and Atlantic divisions, the Capitals and the Maple Leafs each hope to come away with two standings points to gain separation from rivals.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 With the 2018 Major League Soccer season set to start early next month, D.C. United will play its home opener against the Houston Dynamo at the Maryland SoccerPlex in Montgomery County.\nThe change of scene was necessary because the team won\u2019t have its real home field to play on until July 14, when its new soccer stadium, Audi Field, makes its debut.\nThe Washington Post reported that the team originally had requested to play all 17 home matches in Audi Field, but the MLS rejected the proposal. Instead, the team will play a pair of home matches locally in Maryland before playing in their new stadium.\nThe team\u2019s first home match will be against the Houston Dynamo on March 17 at the SoccerPlex in Boyds, Maryland, at 1:30 p.m.\nKeith Lenert, the director of operations at the SoccerPlex, said the venue has hosted D.C. United games in the past, but never a regular season match.\n\u201cWe hosted D.C. United-Chicago Fire and D.C. United-Columbus Crew, but those were in the U.S. Open Cup competition,\u201d Lenert said. \u201cThis will be the first MLS, officially sanctioned match that we will have hosted.\u201d\nThe Maryland SoccerPlex has been the home venue for the Washington Spirit, a National Women\u2019s Soccer League team, since 2013. The Spirit are scheduled to play 12 games at the SoccerPlex this upcoming NWSL season.\nOne of the concerns heading into the game is the 5,000-seat capacity of the SoccerPlex. Audi Field is set to have a capacity of 20,000 and the team\u2019s former home, RFK Stadium in Washington, had a capacity for about 46,000 people.\n\u201cThere\u2019s permanent seating for 3,200 and then we open up a hillside that will accommodate another 1,000 or so,\u201d Lenert said. \u201cThen there\u2019s some standing room because it\u2019s such a small, bowl-type environment.\u201d\nLast season, D.C. United had an average attendance of 17,904 per game. Given the limited capacity at the Maryland SoccerPlex, the event could very well sell out.\nThat could pose multiple issues for the venue.\nThe team and facility have made efforts to ensure the infrastructure and amenities at the complex are up to par for an official MLS match. Lenert said there are some amenities that D.C. United will bring in specifically for the game.\nLindsay Simpson, D.C. United\u2019s director of media and communication, offered details.\n\u201cWe are adding the necessary infrastructure to support our match broadcast as well as our pre- and post-match coverage,\u201d Simpson said \u201cThere will also be infrastructure additions to accommodate the crowd size, including security, restrooms, concessions and any other necessary areas.\u201d\nIn addition to the D.C. United game, the MSI Cherry Blossom Classic soccer tournament and the MVSA Volleyball Tournament also will be going on around the SoccerPlex and in the nearby Discovery Sports Center. According to Lenert, the team and venue have taken steps to address the possible safety and parking concerns for the various events that day.\n\u201cThe biggest adjustment is probably planning for overflow parking,\u201d Lenert said. \u201cWe have a earthen area on site here at the park that we will use periodically for large-scale events that require overflow parking.\u201d\nHe said the venue has worked closely with the Maryland-National Capital Park Police to coordinate appropriate levels of police detail to support both traffic and the stadium crowd.\nD.C. United\u2019s second home game will be played at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland, on Saturday, April 14, against the Columbus Crew SC.\nD.C. United starts its 2018 season on the road against Orlando City SC on March 3.",

Despite Tom Brady's reputation for fourth-quarter comebacks, the Eagles' defense held strong to clinch the win.",
    "content": "BLOOMINGTON, Minnesota \u2014 The Philadelphia fans, who made up the majority of the 67,612 spectators at U.S. Bank Stadium for Super Bowl LII on Sunday night, knew their cheers could\u2019ve been short-lived after the Eagles took the lead with just under two and a half minutes remaining.\nNew England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who\u2019s led 42 fourth-quarter comebacks, was taking the field with 2:21 left after Eagles tight end Zach Ertz\u2019s touchdown. In last year\u2019s Super Bowl, Brady guided the Patriots back from a 25-point deficit against the Atlanta Falcons for his fifth championship title.\nBut on the second play of that New England drive, defensive end Brandon Graham stripped the ball from Brady, and defense end Derek Barnett recovered, handing their offense the ball on New England\u2019s 31-yard line.\nThe Philadelphia faithful let out a sigh of relief with its loudest cheer of the game, while many of the Eagles players stormed the field, acting like they had all but sealed their upset victory.\nThe Eagles extended their lead to eight points after Jake Elliott\u2019s field goal, and the Philadelphia defense, which allowed the fourth-fewest yards per game in the NFL regular season, again stopped the Patriots on their final possession to seal the Eagles\u2019 first-ever Super Bowl with a 41-33 victory.\n\u201cIf you had asked me at the beginning of the season how this all would have went or unfolded,\u201d Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have written a story any better.\u201d\nPhiladelphia held a 12-point halftime edge, but the Patriots\u2019 rally seemed all but certain with Brady under center. The teams traded touchdowns to begin the third quarter, and after Brady found wide receiver Chris Hogan for a 26-yard touchdown, the Eagles settled for a field goal. The Patriots responded with 10-play touchdown drive that gave them a 33-32 edge.\nYet Philadelphia quarterback Nick Foles, who replaced the injured Carson Wentz in December, displayed the poise that helped him lead the Eagles to wins in all five of the full games he played this year. The 2018 Super Bowl MVP, who signed back with Philadelphia in March after playing elsewhere the previous two seasons, powered a 14-play drive, capped by his 11-yard touchdown pass to Ertz.\nOn a 4th-and-one on the Eagles\u2019 own 45-yard line during that drive, Ertz caught a two-yard pass, one of the many bold plays second-year head coach Doug Pederson presented Sunday against Bill Belichick, one of the great coaches of all time. Foles also caught a touchdown pass from tight end Trey Burton on a 4th-and-one with 38 seconds remaining in the second quarter.\n\u201c[Pederson] said it from the beginning: \u2018We\u2019re going to be aggressive,\u2019\u201d Philadelphia wide receiver Torrey Smith said. \u201cIt means the world that he trusts us in those situations.\u201d\nWhile New England\u2019s offense heavily relied on Brady, who threw for 505 yards and three touchdowns, the Eagles offense was more versatile by switching between pass and run plays. Foles completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. Four different Eagles caught receiving touchdowns.\n\u201cThe big thing that helped me,\u201d Foles said, \u201cwas knowing that I didn\u2019t have to be Superman.\u201d\nThe Eagles have prided themselves as underdogs since Wentz\u2019s injury, a mindset Ertz said helped the team bond. Philadelphia was projected to lose all its playoff games, and players wore dog masks following their first two victories.\nSo, after Foles led the go-ahead drive, the Eagles defensive players encouraged each other to take advantage of the moment they had desired. They knew Brady would hold onto the ball for a long time, Graham said, since he had been throughout the game. The group that Smith called the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of the team came through.\nThen, after Elliott\u2019s field goal, Brady threw 3-for-8 on the Patriots\u2019 final drive, only moving to the New England 49-yard line before time expired. The Eagles players rushed the field, and they roamed freely for as long as they pleased this time, soaking in the confetti falling from the ceiling and indulging in the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation Philadelphia supporters had long waited for.\n\u201cPhilly is crazy right now,\u201d Philadelphia defensive tackle Fletcher Cox said. \u201cThe city probably won\u2019t sleep for a week.\u201d",

Despite not receiving initial college attention, Hollins will play in the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots, showcasing his unique journey and success.",
    "content": "BLOOMINGTON, Minnesota \u2014 As a senior playing for the Wootton High School football team in Rockville, Maryland, wide receiver Mack Hollins dressed in a suit and tie and carried a briefcase around school everyday. All of his friends questioned his attire, but they became used to it after two weeks.\n\u201cYou dress for the job you want,\u201d Hollins told Capital News Service, \u201cnot the job you have.\u201d\nHollins has continued those quirky actions as a rookie wide receiver with the Philadelphia Eagles. \nHe played with a Rubik\u2019s Cube to stay calm when speaking with Super Bowl media this week. He always rides his bike to the NovaCare Complex for Eagles practice, and he\u2019s encouraged his teammates to buy Nintendo Switches so they can play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with him.\nHollins\u2019 different personality correlates with the unusual path he took to the NFL. \nWootton is best known for its academics, rarely producing Division I college talent. \nHollins didn\u2019t receive any Division I scholarship offers out of high school or after his year at Fork Union Military Academy in Fork Union, Virginia. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill admitted Hollins, where he walked onto the team and stood out on special teams.\nAfter completing his roundabout route to the NFL, Hollins and the Eagles will play in the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots on Sunday at 6:30 p.m.\n\u201cMack was a home run,\u201d said Marcus Berry, North Carolina\u2019s former director of player personnel. \u201cIn the nine years I\u2019ve done it, he\u2019s one of the highlights of my career. I\u2019m not surprised by any of his success.\u201d\nHollins didn\u2019t play his junior year at Wootton for an incident he didn\u2019t specify, which Wootton coach Eddie Tolliver said prevented him from receiving college attention. \nWootton hasn\u2019t groomed another NFL player in Tolliver\u2019s seven years leading the program, so college scouts didn\u2019t spend much time watching Wootton\u2019s games.\nBut Hollins\u2019 dad, Richard, connected with Berry through their ties of playing football at West Virginia University. Hollins\u2019 speed impressed Berry, and he encouraged the Rockville native to attend preparatory school for a year to gain more exposure.\nHollins learned how to long snap at Fork Union, just so he could get on the field at some position. \nStill, Hollins didn\u2019t receive any Division I offers after his season at Fork Union. He emailed about 100 colleges, and while some of the coach\u2019s secretaries responded, Berry was one of the only coaches to respond himself.\nHollins attended North Carolina, and Berry, still impressed by Hollins\u2019 upside, did everything he could to help Hollins make the team.\n\u201cI can\u2019t be in college just reading books,\u201d Hollins said, \u201cand not doing something with my extra time.\u201d\nLarry Fedora had just taken over as head coach of the Tar Heels, and he wanted 12 speedy wide receivers to fit his multi-tempo, no-huddle spread offense, and there was only one roster spot available.\nBerry stood up for Hollins at the team\u2019s pair of meetings to decide who to pick for that final spot. \nBerry guaranteed Fedora that Hollins would be on scholarship by the end of his scholarship year, and Hollins gave himself two years to earn a scholarship because of the burden of paying out-of-state tuition.\nNorth Carolina chose Hollins, and Berry\u2019s prediction panned out, as the Tar Heels placed Hollins on scholarship entering his sophomore year.\n\u201cWhen he first got here, I didn\u2019t know if he could catch. I didn\u2019t know he could tackle,\u201d North Carolina strength and conditioning coach Lou Hernandez said. \u201cBut watching him run, it was like, \u2018We got to find something for this guy to do.\u2019\u201d\nHollins separated himself with his work ethic. He won every sprinting drill, and after finishing his conditioning training, he would run on the treadmill. \nSometimes, he would go through the conditioning drills twice, when some players couldn\u2019t even finish their first round.\nCoaches worried about Hollins\u2019 ability to catch, so he spent 30 extra minutes before and after practices working on the JUGS machine.\nBehind Hollins\u2019 6-foot, 4-inch frame and agility, Berry said, he developed into one of the best special teams players in North Carolina history. He was one of the team\u2019s top two receivers by his sophomore year, and he led the country with 24.8 yards per reception his junior season.\nThe Eagles selected Hollins in the fourth round of the 2017 NFL Draft.\n\u201cThe other guys on the team were like, \u2018Man, you have to chill out. You\u2019re not going to make it through,\u2019\u201d Berry said. \u201cHe would literally win every race. It just got to the point where it was like, \u2018Just do what Mack does.\u2019\u201d\nHollins still visits Wootton when he\u2019s home, serving as a mentor for the current players, a role he didn\u2019t have as a high schooler since no other Wootton player was in the NFL. \nThe players were nervous to talk with Hollins before he started working out at the school often between graduating from North Carolina and reporting to Eagles training camp.\n\u201cHe inspires me,\u201d Wootton wide receiver Elijah Trent said, \u201cbecause he never lost sight of his dream.\u201d \nHollins has made his biggest difference in the NFL on special teams, although Philadelphia special teams coordinator Dave Fipp said it usually takes about three years to become a great special teams performer. \nHollins has served a defined role as a big-play wideout in a crowded receivers corps, recording 16 catches for 226 yards.\nEagles safety Jaylen Watkins said Hollins reads defenders\u2019 hand placements in practices and often makes slight adjustments on his routes to get open.\n\u201cSome NFL players are flashy,\u201d Watkins said, \u201cbut Mack likes what he likes.\u201d\nEven as Hollins cracks jokes throughout meetings, his teammates and coaches respect the journey that has led him to the Super Bowl.\n\u201cYou can just tell the way he runs routes he\u2019s a smart guy,\u201d Eagles safety Rodney McLeod said. \u201cHe\u2019s not overly fast or anything, but he\u2019s very crafty and finds a way to get open. He\u2019s going to be around here for a long time.\u201d",

    "summary": "Bill Belichick, the New England Patriots' coach, has maintained his connection to lacrosse throughout his 42-year NFL career, frequently visiting Johns Hopkins University's practices and games. His deep passion for the sport dates back to his college days at Wesleyan University, where he played and assisted in coaching.",
    "content": "Editor\u2019s note: This special Super Bowl coverage from Minnesota is a collaboration between Capital News Service and the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism. \nBLOOMINGTON, Minnesota \u2013 The Johns Hopkins men\u2019s lacrosse players were starstruck.  \nNew England Patriots coach Bill Belichick was visiting their practice in Baltimore for the first time in the spring of 2007, and most of the players choked up when saying hello to one of the best-ever NFL coaches.\n\nSince then, the players who have rotated through the program have become comfortable around Belichick. Belichick started visiting Johns Hopkins\u2019 practices and games about three times per year after developing a friendship with coach Dave Pietramala in 2006, learning all of the players\u2019 names and chatting with them individually. \nAn Annapolis, Maryland, native, Belichick played lacrosse and football at Wesleyan University. While he\u2019s paved a legacy in coaching football and will try for his sixth Super Bowl on Sunday at 6:30 p.m. against the Philadelphia Eagles, Belichick has maintained his connection to lacrosse throughout his 42-year coaching career.\n\u201cThere is a great passion that he has for the sport,\u201d Pietramala told Capital News Service. \u201cHe\u2019s very, very knowledgeable of the game.\u201d\nThe offices of former Wesleyan University Athletic Director John Biddiscombe and men\u2019s lacrosse coach Terry Jackson were next to each other when Belichick played at the college in the early 1970s Belichick would usually be in Jackson\u2019s office when Biddiscombe arrived at work around 8 a.m., helping create practice plans and strategies for upcoming games. \nBelichick was one of the best players on his Division III squad. He played at Annapolis High School, as well as at Phillips Academy in Massachusetts during a postgraduate year.\nBiddiscombe said Belichick acted as an assistant coach, examining the game similarly to the way he broke down plays as a center and tight end for the football team. The 5-foot, 11-inch defenseman asked the coaching staff about defensive changes and suggested adjustments if the opposing offense set up its formation differently than the Cardinals planned.\n\u201cHis talent, particularly his size limitations,\u201d Biddiscombe said, \u201creally stirred him more to lacrosse.\u201d\nPatriots wide receiver Chris Hogan, who played lacrosse at Pennsylvania State University, said hand-eye coordination, physicality and stamina are the main skills that correlate between football and lacrosse. \nHogan said Belichick brought up his lacrosse background when the Ramapo, New Jersey, native signed with New England in 2016.\n\u201cAny opportunity that we have to promote a game we both love,\u201d Hogan told a small group of reporters here, \u201cit\u2019s a great opportunity.\u201d\nWhen he coached with the Detroit Lions in 1976-77, Belichick also helped coach lacrosse during the spring at a local prep school.\nBelichick often played lacrosse in his backyard with his three children, Steve, Amanda and Brian, when they were growing up. He was available often during spring lacrosse season because it didn\u2019t overlap with football. \nAll three of Belichick\u2019s children played in college, and Amanda Belichick is now Holy Cross\u2019 women\u2019s lacrosse coach.\nBelichick\u2019s children\u2019s passion for lacrosse grew when Bill Belichick joined the Patriots as an assistant head coach and defensive backs coach in 1996, and his family moved from Cleveland to Boston, where lacrosse was more popular. \nOne year later, the Belichick family moved near Long Island, New York, when Belichick took the same job with the New York Jets, and his children competed against some of the top youth lacrosse players in the country.\n\u201cEvery coach has great points, but at the end of the day for me, what my dad said was the bottom line,\u201d Steve Belichick, who\u2019s now the Patriots safeties coach, said in an interview with reporters. \u201cHe has a good track record.\u201d\nLacrosse is one of the main ways Bill Belichick bonded with his children, and they continue to bounce ideas off each other now, as Brian Belichick joined his father and brother on New England\u2019s staff as a coaching assistant in June.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly helps me give a good perspective on things (Steve) sees as an assistant coach,\u201d Bill Belichick said. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly a lot closer to the age of the players than I am. He has a good feel for things \u2026 I might need to address that I missed because I don\u2019t see the point of view that he sees.\u201d\nBill Belichick, who occasionally wears Johns Hopkins gear, discussed his Baltimore roots with Pietramala after Johns Hopkins won the 2005 national championship. \nSince then, the pair has visited each other\u2019s practices, discussed the top professional and college lacrosse players and shared lacrosse strategy \nWith the 2017 NCAA men\u2019s lacrosse Final Four in Gillette Stadium, Belichick practiced alongside the teams and delivered a speech to Ohio State. Belichick often also presents motivational speeches to the Johns Hopkins squad when he visits. \nOne of Bill Belichick\u2019s favorite memories came about a decade ago, Pietramala said, when he warmed up former goalkeeper Jesse Schwartzman. \nSchwartzman couldn\u2019t tell if Bill Belichick, a righty, was right- or left-handed when he took shots because he was so skillful with his stick.\nMoments like those are one of the reasons Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said lacrosse is one of the four things that make Belichick smile.\n\u201cI marvel that he still has that burning passion for lacrosse,\u201d Biddiscombe said.",

    "content": "Editor\u2019s note: This special Super Bowl coverage from Minnesota is a collaboration between Capital News Service and the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism. \nBLOOMINGTON, Minnesota \u2014 Facing Gwynn Park High School as a cornerback for Potomac High School in 2010, Ronald Darby slipped and fell to the ground. \nA Gwynn Park receiver was caught up in a scrum of defenders.  Darby figured his foe would get tackled, so he did not immediately get up.\n\nThen the opposing wideout broke away with a clear field to the end zone. Darby, now with the Philadelphia Eagles, stood up and sprinted. He caught the receiver 40 yards down field and stripped the ball loose.\n\u201cDarby had a chance to fall down, cross his legs, look at our kid get in front, get up and catch him,\u201d Gwynn Park football coach Danny Hayes told Capital News Service.\nDarby\u2019s speed, which carried him to Florida State University and the NFL, was the main reason he stood out at the Oxon Hill, Maryland school. He was recognized as Maryland\u2019s second-best class of 2012 football recruit and was one of the fastest high school track-and-field sprinters in the country.\n\u201cI\u2019m just naturally fast,\u201d Darby, who still carries around his USA Track & Field backpack from high school, told a small group of reporters at the Mall of America on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s in my genes.\u201d\nWhile Darby has endured injuries since then, his quickness helped him earn a starting role in each of his first three NFL seasons, now as cornerback with a team trying to win its first-ever Super Bowl. He\u2019s recorded three interceptions in nine games this season on a defense that\u2019s allowed 17 points in its two playoff games.\nThe Eagles play the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Sunday at 6:30 p.m.\n\u201cDarby is by far the fastest guy I\u2019ve seen in a high school uniform,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cDarby\u2019s gonna do what Darby wants to do.\u201d\nDarby said he always won suicide sprints when he started playing football at eight years old, claiming his quickness came naturally. When Darby was a freshman at Potomac, football coach Ronnie Crump said Darby ran a 4.31 40-yard dash, which led colleges to contact him and Darby every week.\nCoaches from different colleges bumped into each other at Potomac. Whenever Notre Dame\u2019s coaches visited Darby, they\u2019d call him \u201cnitro\u201d to try to flatter him, Crump said.\nCrump usually develops plans for his players to try to make the NFL, but Darby was the only player Crump knew would play professionally from his freshman year.\nThe only way Hayes tried to gameplan for Darby, who played running back and cornerback, was to force him into the middle of the field.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t even see Darby when he hits that corner and goes down the sideline,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIf you blink, you might have an 80-yarder against you every single time.\u201d\nDuring Darby\u2019s sophomore season, Potomac played against Central High School on a muddy field after it had rained all day, so players could hardly run without slipping. The only offense that night came from Darby\u2019s three punt returns for touchdowns. Crumb said Darby accounted for about 90 percent of the Wolverines\u2019 yards in another game against Largo High School, scoring five touchdowns.\nDuring the spring, Darby dominated the track, winning the Maryland 3A state championship in the 100 meters, 200 meters and 4\u00d7100 relay as a senior. He won a bronze medal in the 2011 World Youth Championships in Athletics, where the top high school track athletes around the world competed in France. Darby was one of six American men selected to represent USA Track & Field in a friendly meet in Japan in 2011.\nPotomac track-and-field coach Stan Mullins taught Darby a better sprinting technique and improved his knee lift for acceleration, which helped him in both sports.\nWhile using the leg press machine in the Potomac weight room one afternoon, Darby\u2019s hip flexors popped up over his shorts and caught the attention of his teammates and Mullins. Darby had unusually strong leg muscles, Mullins said.\n\u201cWhen you have a kid that\u2019s natural like that, the only thing you have to do is point them in the right direction,\u201d Mullins said, \u201cand keep their head straight.\u201d\nDarby hoped for a longer career by playing cornerback instead of running back in college. But he also wanted to run track for a backup option, which was one of the reasons he committed to Florida State.\nDarby looked up to former NFL cornerbacks Deion Sanders and Darrell Green, who also ran track in college. He wanted to emulate that speed. But he endured a groin injury entering Florida State, forcing him to focus on football.\nDarby still won the 2012 ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year. After nabbing two interceptions his sophomore season, he started every game the next year and won the 2013 national championship, a happiness Darby hopes to experience again Sunday.\n\u201cSuper Bowl will probably be more of a better feeling,\u201d Darby said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot harder than college.\u201d\nAfter Darby ran the seventh-fastest 40-yard dash at the 2015 NFL Combine, the Buffalo Bills drafted him with the 50th overall selection. He started all 29 games he played in and recorded a pair of interceptions over his two seasons there. In August, the Bills traded Darby to the Eagles for wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round draft pick.\nDarby dislocated his ankle in the first game of the season and was carted off the field, missing eight games. Since his return, Darby\u2019s helped bolster a position group that was one of the Eagles\u2019 weaknesses in preseason.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing that it happened early on, rather than later,\u201d Darby said. \u201cI\u2019m able to play through the postseason.\u201d\nThe 5-foot-11-inch, 193-pound cornerback will often play off his receiver, making it appear as if he\u2019s not tightly guarding, then use his speed to intercept or knock down a pass. Darby will continue to lean on on that skill Sunday, when the Eagles face Tom Brady, arguably the greatest quarterback of all time, in the Super Bowl.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got it all: Speed, quickness,\u201d Eagles safety Corey Graham said Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the fastest guys I\u2019ve played with.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Three athletes who call Maryland home are headed to the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\nThe Winter Olympians and Paralympian include women\u2019s ice hockey player Haley Skarupa, speedskater Thomas Hong and sled hockey player Noah Grove.\nWhile they have yet to be acquainted, they\u2019re all fighting to bring gold medals back to Maryland.\nThe Olympics start Feb. 9 and the Paralympics begin March 8.\nIn the 2016 Summer Olympics, athletes with ties to Maryland dominated. With 18 gold medals, Maryland would have ranked tenth among all countries. Additionally, Maryland\u2019s 2016 Paralympians scored 13 gold medals, which would have placed them thirteenth among all nations competing.\nHaley Skarupa, Montgomery County\nSkarupa, 24, grew up in Rockville and started playing roller and street hockey because of her brother. When he made the switch to ice hockey, she convinced her parents to let her try it as well, and it stuck.\nAlthough she had the opportunity to attend a prep or boarding high school, Skarupa stayed in Rockville to attend Wootton High School.\n\u201cIt was a conversation I had with my parents, but we ultimately decided that if I can play with the (Washington) Pride and they\u2019re giving me just as good if not better opportunity to elevate my game, get better and stay at home, that\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d she told Capital News Service in a telephone interview.\nSkarupa said that playing for the Pride, a women\u2019s junior team based in Rockville, required plenty of travel and missed school time, \u201cand my parents sacrificed a lot to drive me and fly all over.\u201d\nThat collective dedication paid off: Skarupa played Division I hockey at Boston College, where she graduated in 2016. She owns the second-highest scoring record in college history, male or female.\nShe also succeeded on the world stage, three-peating for gold at the 2015-2017 International Ice Hockey Federation Women\u2019s World Championships.\nLeading up to the 2018 Games, Skarupa played with the Boston Pride of the National Women\u2019s Hockey League. She said skating with fellow national team players, many of whom she became close with over the years, is rewarding.\n\u201cIn a non-Olympic year, everyone\u2019s kind of separated throughout the country doing the same thing but in different spots, so I think what\u2019s different is we\u2019re able to (train) all together,\u201d she said.\nIn preparation for Pyeongchang, Team USA scrimmaged against both junior men\u2019s teams and the Canadian women\u2019s team.\nAlthough Skarupa hasn\u2019t met the other Maryland athletes, she said she\u2019d like to get to know them.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some pride there,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many great athletes come out of Maryland.\u201d\nThomas Hong, Howard County\nHong, 20, a lifelong Washington sports fan, was eyeing the 2018 Olympics back in 2014. He said that his life on the ice predated his own birth.\n\u201cMy mom was actually\u2026at my sisters\u2019 practice when she was pregnant with me, and she had to be rushed to the hospital during that practice,\u201d he explained in a telephone interview with CNS.\nHong was skating at age four, just after his family immigrated from South Korea to the United States. At the time, the Washington metropolitan area was a hotspot for aspiring skaters, and the region has increased in prominence since then.\nHong feels fortunate that he grew up in Howard County, and identifies strongly with his home state.\n\u201cYou can pretty much ask anybody\u2026I wear a (University of) Maryland cap every single day of my life,\u201d he said.\nHong attended the University of Maryland as a freshman during the 2015-2016 school year, but put his education on hold in pursuit of the 2018 Olympics. Following the games, he plans to return to the university for the 2018-2019 school year, according to U.S. Speedskating Communications Coordinator Austin Controulis.\nHong has spent the past months fine-tuning his approach to the upcoming races with the U.S. Speedskating coaches, with a focus on maintaining his health.\nHis performance at the Short Track World Junior Championships in January, where he won silver in the 500-meter race and bronze in the 3000-meter relay, was a big factor in his selection for Team USA.\nAlthough Hong is a Marylander at heart, he is very excited that the Olympics will be hosted by his native country.\n\u201cBeing able to go to a country where I\u2019m familiar with, being that my family is able to be there and be comfortable with as well, it just means a lot,\u201d he said.\nNoah Grove, Frederick County\nGrove, 18, was diagnosed with bone cancer and had to have his leg amputated at five years old.\nOnce he learned to run on his prosthetic leg, he played soccer and was introduced to sled hockey through the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore.\nLike Skarupa, Grove frequently traveled the country for tournaments and camps, so he seldom played in Maryland.\nWhile he expressed much love for his hometown of Frederick, Maryland, his personal feelings have taken a backseat to Team USA\u2019s overarching goal.\n\u201cTeam USA has taken over my identity as an athlete,\u201d he said in an email to CNS.\nGrove temporarily resides with his teammates at a house in Chicago, and they train together every day, which has been a new experience for him. But he said, \u201cIt\u2019s great playing against the best every day.\u201d\nHe hopes to exhibit that competitive mindset against international opponents.\nGrove played on the 2017 men\u2019s Para Ice Hockey World Championship team that won silver. The loss is fueling the team\u2019s ambitions to perform better in March.\n\u201cWe became closer and bonded over the same goal, winning a Paralympic gold medal. Since the loss, the motto of the team has become \u2018Team First,\u2019 which perfectly sums up where everyone\u2019s focus is at,\u201d Grove said.\nTwo athletes who were born in Maryland but listed home towns in other states will be in the Olympic Games as well: luger Summer Britcher, born in Baltimore, and freestyle skier Ashley Caldwell, born in Montgomery Village.\nAlso, two of the three alternate ice dancing pairs live and train in Montgomery County. Quinn Carpenter of Wheaton and Lorraine McNamara of Germantown are the second alternates, while sibling duo Michael and Rachel Parsons of Rockville are the third alternates.",

Despite experiencing some of the worst statistical years of his career, Smith now values mentoring his teammates and setting an example for them.",
    "content": "Editor\u2019s note: This special Super Bowl coverage from Minnesota is a collaboration between Capital News Service and the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism. \nBLOOMINGTON, Minnesota \u2014 When playing with wide receiver Torrey Smith for the Baltimore Ravens between 2011 and 2012, wide receiver Anquan Boldin encouraged Smith to teach his teammates everything he\u2019d learned, so his peers wouldn\u2019t commit the same mistakes.\n\nAt the time, that message wasn\u2019t that ingrained in Smith\u2019s mind. He was in the prime of his career after entering the NFL from the University of Maryland, notching at least 840 receiving yards in his first three professional seasons and helping the Ravens win the 2013 Super Bowl.\nBut as Smith\u2019s production decreased, he transitioned into a leadership role.\nSmith has set the example and served as the vocal catalyst for the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 receiver corps this season. So, after enduring the three worst statistical years of his career, he appreciates playing in the Super Bowl more than he did five years ago, and he\u2019s realized his biggest contributions may come from teaching.\n\u201cYou want to give (your teammates) everything you have, but work hard so they don\u2019t take your job,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI go out there and bust my tail each and every day. I try to set the tempo. I\u2019ve had some experiences they\u2019re going to learn from, experiences that they will go through.\u201d\nThe Eagles take on the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Sunday. The game begins at 6:30 p.m. \nSmith starred on all of his teams growing up. He was the best player in almost every game when he played quarterback for Stafford Senior High School in Falmouth, Virginia. He was so explosive that coach Chad Lewis would substitute the backup quarterback into the game during third and long situations, just so Smith could line up at wide receiver and use his speed for a first down.\nColleges recruited Smith at wide receiver because of his athleticism, and Smith was an All-ACC selection as a wide receiver and kick returner his sophomore and junior seasons at Maryland. He recorded 1,055 receiving yards and 12 receiving touchdowns in 2010 before leaving for the NFL Draft, when the Ravens selected him in the second round.\nSmith\u2019s success continued with the Ravens, but he didn\u2019t receive the same role he had in Baltimore when the 49ers signed him in 2015. The Richmond, Virginia, native recorded a combined 930 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns in a combined 28 games in San Francisco, which won just seven games during that span.\n\u201cYou know how much goes into your heart to be ready for a game and to work the way you do and to not have that type of success? It\u2019s stressful,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI see why a lot of guys struggle with mental issues.\u201d\nWhile searching for his football identity when he joined a crowded Eagles receiving corps in March, Smith focused on Boldin\u2019s message from a few years back. While he would play behind Alshon Jeffery and Nelson Agholor, Smith told his counterparts what tactic he\u2019s used to be successful while fostering a positive atmosphere.\nSmith notices how his teammates can improve their route-running during film sessions and practices, pulling them aside individually to provide tips.\nOff the field, Smith has also set an example for his teammates.\nHe leads the Torrey Smith Family Fund, which provides resources to children in low-income areas. He performs community service in Baltimore and Philadelphia on off-days and was one of four players who penned a letter to league Commissioner Roger Goodell to ask for league support on social activism.\nSmith has always been that outgoing, Lewis said, spending time with his most popular and shy classmates in high school.\n\u201cI can call him at two in the morning,\u201d Eagles wide receiver Mack Hollins said, \u201cand if it came down to it, he\u2019d help me out.\u201d\nSmith\u2019s advice has been especially crucial during the postseason, since he\u2019s the only Eagles wide receiver who has played in the Super Bowl.\nSmith has handed out tips on staying in the moment, telling his teammates it\u2019ll feel like a regular game once the players finish media availabilities Thursday. He\u2019s brought up the aggressive mindset of the Baltimore receivers when former Ravens wideout Jacoby Jones caught a 70-yard touchdown pass in the final minute of the 2013 AFC Divisional Round to send their game against Denver Broncos into overtime and ultimately a victory.\nThe 6-foot, 205-pound receiver also explained the butterflies and happiness that come from winning the Super Bowl, motivating his teammates to desire that same emotion.\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best teammates I\u2019ve ever been around,\u201d Jeffery said. \u201cHe wants to see the best in you, whatever it is.\u201d\nSmith still has made crucial plays, such as the flea flicker touchdown he caught in the Eagles\u2019 38-7 win over the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Championship. But the 29-year-old finished the regular season with his second-fewest receiving yards of his seven-year career (430).\nMuch has also changed off the field for Smith since he last played in the Super Bowl. He\u2019s had two kids, and he\u2019s traded his dreadlocks for a buzz cut.\nThe challenges he\u2019s overcome in both areas of his life left him smiling Tuesday when discussing how he\u2019ll feel as he again takes football\u2019s biggest stage.\n\u201cThis time around,\u201d Smith said, \u201cit\u2019s just way sweeter.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 After wrapping up their longest stretch of road games this season, the Washington Wizards returned home Tuesday to play the Oklahoma City Thunder without point guard John Wall.\nEarlier that day, the team announced that the all-star point guard would require arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, the same knee that has bothered him all season. According to The Washington Post, Wall is expected to miss the next six to eight weeks for the Wizards.\nThis news comes at a difficult time for the team, which is currently fifth in the Eastern Conference standings. With the seventh-seeded Indiana Pacers only a single loss behind the Wizards, this six-to-eight-week stretch without Wall will be critical for the team\u2019s playoff aspirations.\nOver the next six weeks, the Wizards will play 19 games \u2013 15 against teams with records above .500. Without Wall, the schedule could be a tough challenge.\nAfter all, the team will be without its second-leading scorer, assist leader and leading blocker for more than a month. As bad as this news might seem, the Wizards are still confident in the talent they have on the roster.\n\u201cYou never want to see anybody get injured, especially a guy like John,\u201d Wizards shooting guard Bradley Beal said. \u201cBut things do happen and it\u2019s always next man up.\u201d\nWithout Wall, the Wizards will have to rely on backup point guard Tom\u00e1\u0161 Satoransk\u00fd as the primary ball-handler.\nDespite some struggles early in the year, the Czech guard has made the most of his increased playing time.\nDuring a nine-game stretch that Wall missed from Nov. 25 to Dec. 12 with left knee issues, Satoransk\u00fd averaged 8.4 points, 4.4 assists and 3.4 rebounds, including an impressive career-high 17-point performance against the Detroit Pistons on Dec. 1.\nThen on Tuesday night, Satoransk\u00fd put on yet another solid performance, this time as the starting point guard, in a 102-96 win against the Thunder. The Czech guard picked up six assists, five rebounds and two steals to go along with four points.\nOn the defensive side, Satoransk\u00fd also managed to limit all-star point guard Russell Westbrook to only 13 points on 5-18 shooting. When the Wizards and Thunder faced off on Jan. 25, Westbrook scored 46 points, so Satoransk\u00fd\u2019s efforts on defense made a difference the second time around.\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s game, Satoransky poke about the difficulties of transitioning from being a backup player to a starter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge because you\u2019re playing against their starters, so it\u2019s kind of different,\u201d Satoransk\u00fd said. \u201cIt was my fourth start in three years and obviously you got to play much more focused, on defense especially.\u201d\nWith Satoransk\u00fd making the most of his playing time, and Beal playing at an elite level, the Wizards will need small forward Otto Porter Jr. to become a more consistent scorer in Wall\u2019s absence.\nPorter is currently the team\u2019s third-leading scorer, averaging 13.8 point a game, but has struggled to find his rhythm in January, when he\u2019s only averaged 11 points.\nThe small forward has also recently dealt with hip issues and has had to miss games throughout the season because of it. Although Porter admits he is far from being fully healthy, he said he would do whatever it takes to play.\nThis should be a good sign, especially after Porter scored 25 points against the Thunder, the most he\u2019s scored since Dec. 29. The small forward hit some tough shots throughout the night and helped the Wizards pull away near the end to win.\nWith Wall out, Porter knows he and his teammates will have to rise to the occasion to keep the Wizards\u2019 playoff hopes alive.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to start getting W\u2019s,\u201d Porter said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to step up, including myself.\u201d",

    "content": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Rodney McLeod, the Philadelphia Eagles starting safety, never came off the field at DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland, starring as a cornerback, wide receiver and kick returner.\nWhile former DeMatha coach Bill McGregor couldn\u2019t predict an NFL career for his star player, McLeod\u2019s speed and poise made him hopeful.\nOn the first play of overtime in the 2006 Washington Catholic Athletic Conference Championship game against Good Counsel, DeMatha was lined up on the 25-yard line. Instead of trying to gain short yardage, the Stags threw a fade to McLeod in the end zone on the first play. McLeod caught it, sealing one of the four league titles he won with DeMatha. The Clinton, Maryland native stills keeps a picture of that catch in his mother\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not backing away from anybody,\u201d McGregor told Capital News Service.\nMcLeod has used that explosiveness to power a six-year NFL career, now with a defense that\u2019s surrendered a combined 17 points in its two playoff games and will play for the franchise\u2019s first-ever Super Bowl win on Sunday.\n\u201cAt DeMatha, the culture is knowing hard work does pay off,\u201d McLeod told reporters at the Super Bowl Opening Night event Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s mandatory for you to be a great player. Those things helped me and keep pushing me everyday.\u201d\nMcLeod and his high school teammates spent their lunches in the film room, a tradition McLeod said shaped his work ethic. That principle stayed with him in his college career at the University of Virginia.\nMcLeod could\u2019ve been caught around the Virginia football facilities at almost any time of the day carrying a notebook between 2008 and 2011, taking notes while sitting in former coach Mike London\u2019s office or at quarterback and wide receiver meetings.\nWhile McLeod played safety, he wanted to get inside offensive players\u2019 minds, so he knew when to cut off receivers\u2019 cuts on certain routes or how many players should blitz based on the running scheme. McLeod also chose about five plays from film of every game to break down his weaknesses and notice small details in formations, a practice he continues in the NFL.\n\u201cHis football knowledge was as high as anything I\u2019ve been around,\u201d said London, who now coaches Howard University.\nIn addition to his study habits, McLeod\u2019s toughness stuck out to London.\nIn one Cavaliers home game, McLeod predicted a run play and filled the hole the back was running through. Against a bigger player, McLeod sent the crowd into a frenzy after finishing a big hit.\nThe collision bent McLeod\u2019s facemask, and his helmet hardly fit him properly with turf grass sticking out of the sides. Still, he flashed a wide grin for minutes and yelled, \u2018Did you see that?\u2019 to London as he celebrated on the sideline.\nMcLeod, though, is only 5 feet 10 inches tall, a factor in him going undrafted in 2012 and facing an uphill battle to make an NFL roster. But McLeod separated himself with his knowledge and work ethic when the St. Louis Rams signed him after the draft.\nDennard Wilson, who played at DeMatha in the late-1990s and was coaching defensive backs with St. Louis at the time, told McGregor that McLeod impressed the team with his intelligence and his defensive positioning, McGregor said. Competing against players drafted ahead of McLeod motivated him to adjust to the speed of the game, he said.\nA few weeks into practice, Wilson told McGregor he thought McLeod would sustain a 10-year NFL career.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a student of the game, and you study, that allows you to play faster, and it allows you to play more positions,\u201d said Tony Paige, McLeod\u2019s agent. \u201cThat\u2019s what coaches in the National Football League are looking for.\u201d\nWilson\u2019s prediction has panned out so far. McLeod cemented a starting role with the Rams in 2013 and signed with the Eagles as a free agent in 2016, recording three interceptions in each of the past two years, while also recovering two fumbles this season.\nOn Sunday, McLeod will be tasked with stopping Tom Brady and the New England Patriots, who have won two of the past three Super Bowls and averaged the second-most points per game during the NFL regular season.\nAs he looks to become the first DeMatha alum to win the Super Bowl, McLeod will likely spend much of his time planted in front of a screen in the film room, the same place that\u2019s propelled his career.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t help that he\u2019s 5-10,\u201d Paige said, \u201cbut he\u2019s got a 7-foot heart.\u201d\nThis story is a collaboration between Capital News Service and the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Fans of D.C. United gathered in front of the construction site of the team\u2019s new soccer stadium, Audi Field, Friday afternoon to commemorate the placement of the final steel beam in the team\u2019s new home at Buzzard Point.\nBefore the ceremony, fans were given the opportunity to sign the steel beam with a marker. By 1:45 p.m., the beam was covered from end-to-end with different signatures, messages and team chants from fans wearing the team\u2019s traditional black-and-red gear.\nEven with the chilly weather, fans of all ages continued to pour into the construction site before the ceremony.\nThomas Gardiner, a University of Maryland graduate student and long-time D.C. United supporter, was excited to see the soccer stadium come to life.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long ride with a lot of bumps on the road,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cFrom Poplar Point 10 years ago, to finally seeing this rising up from the ground, it\u2019s a good day.\u201d\nJuan Lopez, a northern Virginia native and season ticket holder, said he was also happy to see Audi Field move along in the construction process. However, he also mentioned he was a bit sad to see RFK Stadium go.\n\u201cThat\u2019s been like a second home for me for the last 10 years, but it\u2019s also exciting to be in a new place,\u201d Lopez said.\nAt 2:00 p.m., the beam signing came to an end. According to Lindsay Simpson, D.C. United\u2019s director of media and communications, season ticket holders were allowed to sign the beam throughout the week. She estimated that more than 2,000 people had signed the beam by the end of Friday\u2019s ceremony.\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful, exciting and encouraging for us to see the fan base and the community continue to rally around us for every stage of this process,\u201d Simpson said.\nAfter the signing, Simpson and Tom Hunt, D.C. United\u2019s president of business operations, spoke to those in attendance and thanked the construction team that worked on the stadium, as well as the team\u2019s sponsors. They also thanked the fans and season ticket holders for their continued support.\nAt the end of the ceremony, workers on the site hooked the steel beam to a large crane that had been in the background of the construction site. Simpson ordered the crane to carry the final piece of steel to the top of the stadium as fans cheered and took photos.\nWith another phase of construction at Audi Field completed, Simpson said that there would be no delays and that D.C. United\u2019s new home would be open on time for the team\u2019s inaugural match against the Vancouver Whitecaps on July 14.\n\u201cOne hundred and sixty-nine days to go,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the countdown clock going on our Audi Field D.C. website and we are charging forward for 7:00 p.m. on July 14. So we are very excited for that day.\u201d",

    "summary": "At FedEx Field, the presence of visiting team fans is significant, with at least 5% of the crowd supporting the Vikings during their game against Washington, and a nearly equal number of Cowboys and Washington fans in some sections. This trend suggests that Washington may not have a strong home field advantage due to the large presence of opposing team supporters.",
    "content": "LANDOVER, Maryland \u2014 It was Nate Davis\u2019 third time attending an NFL game at FedEx Field, but he wasn\u2019t rooting for the home team.\nDavis and his two friends are Dallas Cowboys fans from the Philadelphia area. They made the trip to Landover, Maryland to watch the Cowboys take on Washington on Oct. 29. Even though Philadelphia also has an NFC East rival that hosts the Cowboys every year, Davis seems to prefer to go to Maryland.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re in Dallas, there\u2019s so many [Cowboys] fans here,\u201d Davis said.\nA generation ago, Washington\u2019s was one of the NFL\u2019s best teams. Even for diehard fans of the team, tickets for home games at FedEx Field and RFK Stadium were hard to find. Now, on fall Sundays, it\u2019s not unusual to see thousands of fans wearing colors other than burgundy and gold at FedEx field, cheering on the visiting team.  \nThis fall, Capital News Service set out to quantify the presence of visiting fans at FedEx field.  At two home games \u2014 a loss to Dallas on Oct. 29 and a loss to Minnesota on Nov. 12 \u2014 CNS took detailed photographs of each section and analyzed them with a computer program that made it easier to count visiting team fans in the images.     \nIntense rain at the Cowboys game made it difficult to get an accurate count of the visiting fan presence for the entire stadium. But CNS determined that there were at least 3,345 Vikings fans in the crowd on Nov. 12 \u2014  about 5 percent of the announced attendance of 74,476 on that clear day. \n[https://twitter.com/SageRosenfels18/status/929799997759152129]\nIt\u2019s possible there were more Vikings fans in the crowd than CNS counted. Our count was conservative, only marking someone as a fan if they were clearly wearing Vikings apparel.  \n\nAgainst the Cowboys, Washington\u2019s biggest rival, the presence of visiting team fans was also striking. In Section 119, in the lower bowl on the 20-yard line, CNS counted 135 Cowboys fans to 111 Washington fans, while another 249 could not be determined based on their clothing. In sections 106 and 107, CNS found 84 Cowboys fans, 111 Washington fans and 311 who could not be determined based on their clothing. \n\u201cWe own this place,\u201d Cowboys fan Chip Garland bragged. \u201cPut that in the paper.\u201d\nWashington posted its second-highest home attendance mark of the season that day, with 78,428 fans, just a few hundred fewer than their season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles (78,685). The Cowboys went on to win, 33-19, and the majority of fans stayed through a second half affected by steady rain.\n\nFather and son Brad and Braedon MacArthur traveled from their hometown just north of Toronto to FedEx Field to attend their first Cowboys game. \nTheir Lyft driver told them on the way to the stadium that Maryland is \u201c50/50\u201d in terms of Washington and Dallas fans, they said. An hour and a half before the game, they had already met Cowboy fans from Austin, Texas and Virginia.\nWashington fan Mike Greene, a native Marylander, was also at the Cowboys game. He said he has seen the effect of visiting fans even at non-division rivalry games. He once sold some of his season tickets to an acquaintance whose fan affiliation he wasn\u2019t aware of.\n\u201cI\u2019m a sales guy and one of my customers knew that we had season tickets. So she wanted my tickets and I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s a good way to build a bridge,\u201d Greene said. \u201cCome to find out she\u2019s a Pittsburgh fan and she wasn\u2019t even there \u2013 she gave all [the tickets] to her Pittsburgh fan friends. We got here and it was a significant number of Pittsburgh people here, and that did affect the home-field advantage. They were pretty loud.\u201d\nGreene agrees that Dallas has fans all around the country, \u201cbut they\u2019re not the only ones.\u201d He said he has gone to Dallas for games three times and earlier this year attended Washington\u2019s Monday night game at Kansas City. \n\u201cYou\u2019d be amazed\u201d how many Washington fans also travel, he said. \u201cWe met people there from Idaho that were (Washington) fans.\u201d\nRolando Montana is a Cowboys fan originally from Texas, now living in Arlington, Virginia. He\u2019s been attending Dallas-Washington games since the days of RFK Stadium. But Montana didn\u2019t believe it hurt Washington\u2019s home-field advantage and said he\u2019s experienced the inverse\u2013he sat next to Washington fans the last time he went to a game in Dallas.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got them in both places,\u201d he said.\nOne other thing: His son was tossing a football around with a young fan wearing Washington red.\n\u201cGoes to show how easy people can get along,\u201d Montana said.\n-30-",

This performance marked a continuation of the team's offensive resurgence, with Backstrom ending his goal drought and Wilson achieving his first four-point game.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Capitals\u2019 top line accounted for three goals in a four-minute span late in the first period Wednesday, propelling Washington to a 6-2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks at Capital One Arena.\nAlex Ovechkin, Nicklas Backstrom and Tom Wilson each scored and tallied at least one assist during the sequence, a continuation of the Capitals\u2019 recent offensive resurgence. Washington has now won six of their last seven games, and have scored at least four goals in five of them.\n\u201cThat line carried us tonight,\u201d head coach Barry Trotz said.\nBackstrom struck first, ending a 21-game goal drought with a shot from between the face-off circles, set up by a swift tap pass from Ovechkin, who positioned himself to the left of Blackhawks goalie Anton Forsberg.\nThree minutes later, Tom Wilson unleashed a shot from the left side boards that caught the fourth-year goaltender by surprise, allowing the puck to slide under Forsberg\u2019s right leg pad.\nOn the ensuing shift, defenseman Dmitry Orlov sprung Wilson on a breakaway with a well-timed dump pass. Wilson was turned away by Forsberg, but Ovechkin was there to follow up the shot and rifle it into an empty net.\nThe Ovechkin-Backstrom-Wilson trio finished with a combined 11 points Wednesday, led by Wilson\u2019s first career four-point-game.\nSince Barry Trotz reunited Ovechkin with Backstrom, his longtime center, November 22 against Ottawa, the Capitals\u2019 captain has scored eight goals in seven games. But the combination has also benefitted the continued development of Tom Wilson, who was more than just a passenger on the team\u2019s most potent line.\n\u201cTom adds an element,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cHe gets pucks, he keeps plays alive, he makes people move the puck a little quicker. I think it\u2019s energized that line a little bit. So, he\u2019s done a really good job and he\u2019s getting rewarded for some really good work.\u201d\nWilson, more known for his physicality than his offensive skillset, has had to pick up the pace of his play to be able to flank world-class players in Ovechkin and Backstrom.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re both working real hard for me, which helps,\u201d Wilson said. \u201c[Ovechkin] is playing with a lot of energy, [Backstrom] is so easy to play with. I\u2019ve found that poise with the puck and they seem to be open and it\u2019s just about making the play.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge for him, huge for us,\u201d Ovechkin said, referencing Wilson. \u201cI think he has to realize how he [has] to play, especially with a center like [Backstrom].\u201d\nWilson, a first-round pick in 2012, had nine points in 24 games entering Wednesday, and has yet to eclipse 25 points in a 82-game season during his career. The coaching staff has said in the past they wanted more offensive production from Wilson, and he has shown marked improvement playing alongside Ovechkin and Backstrom.\n\u201cHe accepts those challenges that we put in front of him and he keeps growing, so I think he\u2019s one a real good path for some success,\u201d Trotz said.\nThe Capitals also received goals from Brett Connolly and Evgeny Kuznetsov, with Ovechkin registering the assists on both. With the win, Washington moved into third place in the Metropolitan Division, leaping the idle New York Islanders.\nThe Capitals third-straight win was punctuated by Wilson\u2019s empty-net goal, which came without his top-tier linemates on the ice.\n\u201cHe\u2019s making plays,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting the puck a lot more, he\u2019s touching it and you can see that his confidence in that area is growing.\u201d",

    "summary": "Alex Ovechkin's recent hat trick brought his career total to 20, making him the leader among active players but still far behind all-time leaders like Wayne Gretzky. The era in which Ovechkin plays, characterized by better defensive strategies and goaltending, makes it unlikely he will surpass the records set in higher-scoring times.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 With his third hat trick of the season Saturday, Alex Ovechkin is quickly climbing the list of all-time hat trick leaders. But the NHL\u2019s premier goal scorer of the 21st century is unlikely to ever top that list because of the era he plays in.\nWith seven goals in the Capitals\u2019 first two games and Saturday\u2019s three-goal performance against Toronto, Ovechkin brought his career regular season hat trick total to 20, the most among active players. The next closest active skater, future Hall of Fame forward Jaromir Jagr, has 15 but has played in 779 more NHL games than the 32-year-old Russian.\n\u201cSometimes you are just feeling it,\u201d Ovechkin told the Associated Press after Saturday\u2019s victory.\nPractically peerless when it comes to three-goal games among current players, Ovechkin still remains well behind the league\u2019s all-time leaders. Wayne Gretzky sits atop the list with 50 regular season hat tricks, with Mario Lemieux (40), Mike Bossy (39), Brett Hull (33) and Phil Esposito (32) rounding out the top five. Ovechkin is in a three-way tie for 14th.\n\u201cTypically, the amount of hat tricks a player has is going to fairly closely track how dominant of a goal scorer they were,\u201d hockey historian James Benesh said. \u201cThe ones who were consistently the best goal scorers of their time are going to be the ones who rack up the most goals and sometimes three of them are going to come in one game.\u201d\n\n\nUnlike Gretzky, Ovechkin has played his entire career in an era where scoring goals is much less common. As a result of larger goaltender equipment, refined defensive strategies and improved physical conditioning, players in today\u2019s NHL have to work harder to find the back of the net.\nGretzky, widely considered the greatest player ever, played his prime years in the high-flying 1980s, where the style of play favored high-powered offenses. During the decade, smaller players took up less space and less athletic goaltenders wearing smaller pads offered skaters more net to shoot at. And more relaxed coaching strategies resulted in more goal scoring.\nDuring Gretzky\u2019s first 12 NHL seasons (1979-1980 to 1990-1991) the average number of goals scored in a game fluctuated between 6.92 and at 8.02, according to Hockey Reference.\nThe goals per game rate began took a significant dip in the latter half of Gretzky\u2019s career. It dropped exactly two goals per game between 1993 and his final season in 1999, signaling the start of the NHL\u2019s Dead Puck Era. By the 2003-2004 season, the goals per game rate registered a 42-year low at 5.14.\nAt the beginning of Ovechkin\u2019s rookie season in 2005-2006, the league enacted rule changes to increase league-wide scoring. It eliminated the two-line pass rule, which prevented players from receiving passes from their own defensive zone past center ice. It introduced the trapezoid behind the net to restrict goalies\u2019 puck-handling capabilities. And it strictly enforced holding infractions.\nAs a result, the goals per game average rose to 6.16 in 2005-2006. The changes failed to have a permanent effect on scoring rates. The average goals per game rate has failed to exceed 6.0 since, fluctuating between 5.42 and 5.90.\n\n\n\u201cYou could say one goal today is like one-third of a win,\u201d Benesh said. \u201cSometimes in the [1980s] a goal was one-fifth of a win. So, it\u2019s definitely different. It made it a lot easier to score goals, it made it a lot easier to get more hat tricks in a higher scoring environment too.\u201d\nOvechkin has led the NHL in hat tricks just once, racking up two during the 38-game lockout-shortened 2013 season. But he has scored multiple hat tricks in six seasons, including this year.\nTwenty-five games into the 2017-2018 season, Ovechkin has three, already matching last year\u2019s season high set by Patrik Laine of the Winnipeg Jets. With three goals against the Maple Leafs on Saturday, he passed Peter Bondra to become the Capitals franchise hat trick leader.\nDespite Ovechkin\u2019s impressive start, he still remains well behind Gretzky, who reached 20 hat tricks at the age of 22, putting Ovechkin far behind the Great One\u2019s scorching pace.\n\n\nWhile Ovechkin will probably not surpass Gretzky\u2019s career hat trick record, the data suggests that Ovechkin has been hampered by lower scoring rates during his career. The Capitals winger has fallen one goal short of a hat trick 95 times in 13 seasons, with opportunities likely waning as he ages.\nNo matter where Ovechkin finishes on the all-time career hat trick list, he should still be viewed as his generation\u2019s best finisher, and most prolific hat trick scorer.",

    "summary": "Joe Flacco's 2017 season is his worst yet, with poor deep passing and more interceptions than touchdowns, placing him among the league's least effective quarterbacks. Despite leading in completion percentage, Flacco's struggles have contributed significantly to the Baltimore Ravens' inconsistent performance this season.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Coming off a win over Green Bay Sunday, the Baltimore Ravens sit at 5-5, currently holding a playoff spot in the AFC despite wildly inconsistent quarterback play from Joe Flacco.\nFlacco is having the worst season of his career, ranking as one of the league\u2019s worst passers in 2017, a Capital News Service analysis found. This can be attributed, in part, to his reluctance to throw passes deep down field, an early-career trademark that helped him win a Super Bowl in 2012.\nThe ten-year NFL veteran is averaging just 173 yards per game, tied for second lowest in the league with Cleveland Browns rookie DeShone Kizer. He\u2019s ahead of only Green Bay Packers rookie Brett Hundley.\nFlacco is just one of five quarterbacks to throw more interceptions than touchdowns this year, joining Kizer, Hundley, San Francisco 49ers rookie C.J. Beathard, and the recently-demoted-to-backup Trevor Siemian of the Denver Broncos.\nHe has thrown a touchdown on just 2.8 percent of his pass attempts, the lowest mark of his career. Meanwhile, he has thrown an interception on 3.4 percent of his attempts, which is just a tick below the career-worst 3.6 percent he set in 2013.\nFlacco\u2019s worst season was 2013, when he set career lows in total quarterback rating (51.2), TD-interception ratio (0.86), and yards per pass attempt (6.4). Through ten games this season, he is on track for lower marks in each of those categories.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve been a little bit quick to get the ball out of my hands at times,\u201d Flacco said in a Baltimore Sun article in October. \u201cI think if I just hang in there and trust the process, trust the pocket, and I might have to step up and make some plays here and there.\u201d\nDespite Flacco\u2019s many struggles this season, he still ranks in the top third of the NFL in completion percentage. In fact, his 65.5 percent to date is the best single-season mark he has posted, better than the career high 64.9 mark he set a year ago. But while he is completing passes, he has failed to make big plays.\nFor much of his career, Flacco\u2019s signature talent has been his ability to launch the deep ball down field, like the 70-yard pass to Jacoby Jones in the 2012 Divisional Round against Denver. This year, he has shied away from taking deep shots.\nAccording to NFL.com, Flacco\u2019s pass attempts go 6.8 yards down the field, last of all qualified quarterbacks. (That stat doesn\u2019t take into account a receiver running with the ball after the catch). His pass attempts, on average, land 2.1 yards short of a first down, the worst in the NFL. (Capital News Service only looked at the 33 quarterbacks with at least 150 passing attempts this season.)\nWith completed passes, Flacco is averaging just 5.44 yards per pass attempt this season, the worst mark of his career and the worst for any passer since Blaine Gabbert\u2019s 5.36 yards per attempt in 2011.\nFlacco has hesitated to throw deep in recent years. His percentage of pass attempts that are for more than 20 yards has decreased every year since hitting a high in 2012, and sits at a career low 6.9 percent this season.\nWhen he does throw the deep ball, he isn\u2019t successful; on these attempts in 2017, he is 5-for-22 (22.7 percent), with two touchdowns and three interceptions, per ESPN.\n\nPerhaps in the past, Flacco\u2019s success was driven by the weapons around him. When he won the Super Bowl in 2012, the Ravens\u2019 offense featured Ray Rice, Torrey Smith and Anquan Boldin. But while their offense today is not as stacked, it still features Jeremy Maclin and Mike Wallace, Pro Bowl receivers who each have multiple 1,000 yard seasons to their name, and Alex Collins, who has been a pleasant surprise out of the backfield.\nFlacco won a Super Bowl and subsequently earned a big payday on the strength of his deep throws down field. Now, he struggles to make those throws, and has morphed into one of the least effective quarterbacks in the NFL.\nFiveThirtyEight gives the Ravens a 65 percent chance of making the playoffs, a number that dramatically increased after Sunday\u2019s victory. But with a crowded AFC playoff hunt, they will need better quarterback play from Flacco to be a legitimate contender.",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Maryland\u2019s two NFL stadiums could be the sites of FIFA World Cup matches come 2026, and executives in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore are working to make that happen.\nWashington and Baltimore are two of 32 cities vying to be named official host cities for a joint North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup. The United Bid Committee, a partnered effort by the United States, Mexico and Canada to win hosting rights for the men\u2019s tournament, is competing with Morocco to host that Cup, and FIFA will announce its choice next June.\nRepresentatives from the 32 cities in contention met in Houston last week for a three-day workshop to present their bids to the United Bid Committee. If North America wins, the committee would pick its official host cities by 2021, said Terry Hasseltine, the chair of Baltimore\u2019s host committee.\nM&T Bank Stadium, the home of the Baltimore Ravens, would host matches if Baltimore is chosen. Baltimore\u2019s bid is a joint effort by the Maryland Stadium Authority, Maryland Sports (the state\u2019s sports commission), Visit Baltimore and several other government entities. Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford serves as the bid\u2019s honorary chair.\nThe Washington bid\u2019s proposed venue is FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, the home of the Washington NFL team. Two organizations are leading the charge: Events DC, which manages venues and convention centers in and around the District, and Destination DC, which handles marketing the city.\n\u201cClearly the impact of soccer, or \u2018the real football\u2019 as it\u2019s called outside the U.S., is big and this affords us the chance to play a larger role for an international audience,\u201d said Elliott Ferguson, president and CEO of Destination DC.\nPerhaps the main draw for cities to partake in a World Cup is the revenue matches are expected to inject into local economies. The 2014 World Cup was estimated to add $3 billion in economic impact for host country Brazil, Forbes reported.\n\u201cAt the end of the day our organization is an economic development organization,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThe economic impact for the city is significant.\u201d\nThe cachet of a global event like the World Cup is also attractive, said Lawrence Hamm, Destination DC\u2019s sports development manager who represented Washington in last week\u2019s workshop.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing it for us\u2026 It\u2019s the reputation of the World Cup that\u2019s on the line, and the reputation of North America,\u201d Hamm said.\nAll cities at the current stage have shown the United Bid Committee they have the infrastructure to host and transport tens of thousands of fans. At the Houston workshop, the United Bid Committee held sessions to discuss how to incorporate innovation, sustainability and human rights initiatives in the bid, Hasseltine said.\n\nThe next step for Baltimore\u2019s bid is for Hasseltine to meet with his partners and community leaders \u201cto get people to understand the weight and the magnitude of what was presented to us so we can meet those deadlines,\u201d he said.\nA less quantifiable factor the committee will consider is the soccer community of each city. Washington has a Major League Soccer franchise, D.C. United, and a National Women\u2019s Soccer League team, the Washington Spirit. The city hosted matches when the United States held the 1994 World Cup, at RFK Stadium, and the 1999 Women\u2019s World Cup, at FedEx Field. The Washington Post reported that the city was the top-rated U.S. market for television viewership through all 64 matches of the 2014 World Cup. \nOn the Baltimore side, Hasseltine also cited TV viewership for international matches when explaining Baltimore\u2019s soccer community, despite the city\u2019s lack of a pro team.\n\u201c(It) means that we have a very large community, and maybe it might be a little bit of a sleeping soccer community,\u201d said Hasseltine, the executive director for Maryland Sports and vice president of communications for the Maryland Stadium Authority.\nHasseltine and Ferguson said they do not see Baltimore and Washington as being in direct competition with one another. Their proximity is an asset, Hasseltine said, because a set of group stage matches among four teams could be played in one geographic area.\n\u201cWhen you look at pool play, which is something we would probably fall most in line with, it is a great venue setup for them to put a pool here in the Mid-Atlantic,\u201d Hasseltine said. \u201cNew York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and potentially D.C. Just imagine the transportation ease when you\u2019ve got Amtrak and easy flights and I-95.\u201d\nThat proximity could provide teams with ease of travel between matches \u2014 and fans as well. Many American fans have multiple rooting interests because Washington is a \u201ctransplant city,\u201d said Melissa Wiley, the secretary of the Washington chapter of American Outlaws, a supporters\u2019 group of the U.S. men\u2019s and women\u2019s national soccer teams with chapters nationwide.\nWiley knows several local soccer fans who support both the U.S. team and another national team aligned with their background.\n\u201cI think you find a lot of that in D.C. because you have people who are first generation of growing up in the United States, and so they support the U.S. but they also support the team that their parents support,\u201d Wiley said.\nIf Washington hosts World Cup matches in the future, it would inspire the area\u2019s youngest generation of soccer players and fans, she added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely different atmosphere,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cI went to Brazil in 2014 and the atmosphere of those games is so much different, so much more electric than just a regular game.\u201d",

    "summary": "Shohei Ohtani, a Japanese baseball phenom, has the potential to become the best two-way player since Babe Ruth if he successfully transitions to MLB, though he may face an adjustment period like other Japanese stars. His usage in MLB could vary depending on the league and team, with possibilities including serving as a designated hitter, pinch hitter, or outfielder on non-pitching days.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 If Shohei Ohtani can successfully make the transition to Major League Baseball, he has the chance to become the best two-way player since Babe Ruth.\nBut if Ohtani \u2014 a Japanese pitching and hitting phenom \u2014 is anything like other stars who jumped from Japan, he will face an adjustment period in the U.S.\nOver the last two decades, Japanese standouts have consistently struggled to match their production in Nippon Professional Baseball, the top league in Japan. In almost every case, pitchers gave up more runs and hitters were less effective at the plate.\nHideki Matsui (the New York Yankees and other teams) and Ichiro Suzuki (the Seattle Mariners and other teams) \u2014 the two most successful Japanese baseball players in the past 30 years \u2014 saw a decline in production, even though they still put up good numbers. Matsui\u2019s OPS (On base percentage plus Slugging) declined 22.94 percent in his first three MLB seasons, while Ichiro\u2019s decreased by 16.33 percent.\n\nTwo successful Japanese pitchers, Yu Darvish (the Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Dodgers) and Masahiro Tanaka (the Yankees), also saw a drop in production. The two allowed 1.65 and 1.61 more runs during their first three seasons in the U.S., respectively, than they did in Japan, while giving up 0.9 and 0.6 more home runs per nine innings.\n\nOhtani is a very unique player, excelling in both hitting and pitching for the Nippon Ham Fighters, where he both pitches and serves as designated hitter. It\u2019s not clear how a MLB team will use him, but it might depend on which league he ends up in.\nAn American League team might use him as its designated hitter on days he doesn\u2019t pitch. A National League team could use him as a pinch hitter when he isn\u2019t pitching. In either league, he could also play outfield on non-pitching days, something he did in 62 games in Japan prior to 2015.\nWhat could Ohtani\u2019s performance on the mound and at the plate look like in the U.S.? To develop a rough estimate, Capital News Service adjusted Ohtani\u2019s pitching and hitting stats in Japan to account for the performance drop-off Japanese players experience when entering MLB.\nOur best guess: Ohtani will not be as good in the U.S. as he is in Japan. But he\u2019ll still probably be one of the better Japanese pitchers in MLB, with a batting average slightly below the typical Japanese hitter in the U.S. And he\u2019ll probably be the best hitting pitcher in all of baseball.\nHere\u2019s how we did it. First, we looked at every Japanese player who played at least two years in the Japanese pro league and at least two years in MLB. For several hitting and pitching statistics, we took the average for each player\u2019s final seasons in Japan and the average of their first few seasons in the U.S. We then calculated the difference, and used that to adjust Ohtani\u2019s Japanese statistics to predict his American performance.\nThere are several limitations to this method. The sample size here is small, with 11 hitters and 21 pitchers. And we didn\u2019t control for factors like age. At 23, Ohtani would be one of the youngest Japanese players to make the jump.\nAt the plate, we project Ohtani\u2019s OPS (on base percentage plus slugging percentage) at .708, slightly lower than average for Japanese players in the U.S.. We think he\u2019ll hit around 15 home runs, if he has a full season of at bats.\n\nAs a pitcher, Ohtani would sport a 3.14 ERA while giving up an average of 0.72 home runs per nine innings, better than average for Japanese players in the U.S.\n\nBy Japanese league standards, Ohtani is great pitcher and a great hitter. By the standard of Japanese hitters who jump to the U.S., Ohtani\u2019s OPS in his last three seasons in Japan is below the average of .895.\nIn the U.S., we think Ohtani will likely be the best hitting pitcher by a good margin, surpassing Madison Bumgarner (San Francisco Giants) for that honor. Bumgarner, who is considered by many to be the league\u2019s best hitting pitcher, has a .631 OPS over the past five seasons, while we project Otani\u2019s OPS would be .077 points higher.\n\nWe also think he\u2019ll be one of the better pitchers in the U.S., with a projected ERA of 3.14 \u2014 much better than the league average of 4.31 for all pitchers.\nOhtani is expected to make the jump in 2018. His NPB team, the Nippon Ham Fighters, announced Friday it would make him eligible to move to the U.S. And Ohtani seems eager to play in the U.S. now, instead of waiting until he\u2019s 25, a move that could cost him tens of millions of dollars.\nRegardless of when Ohtani comes to America, he is set to shake up MLB norms as an impact player on the mound and at the plate.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Sacramento Kings had trimmed a 21-point Wizards lead to 14 with 5:55 to play in their Monday contest.\nWizards coach Scott Brooks had seen enough from his second unit.\nA minute later, John Wall had Kings rookie De\u2019Aaron Fox on his hip in the high post. He spun, and Fox was left in his wake. Wall\u2019s layup gave the Wizards a 99-83 lead and spurred an 8-0 run.\nThe game\u2019s outcome was never in doubt again, as Washington downed Sacramento, 110-82.\nWall outclassed Fox on the spin, exposing his defender\u2019s youth and quashing any hopes of a comeback.\n\u201cHe\u2019s so much bigger than me, I was just making sure he didn\u2019t overpower me and back me all the way down,\u201d Fox explained later. \u201cHe felt me leaning to one side and he did the spin move.\u201d\nFox, who came off the bench Monday, was in the starting lineup when the Wizards and Kings squared off in Sacramento Oct. 29. He totaled 26 minutes in both contests, but failed to shoot greater than 30 percent from the field in either game.\nStill, Fox insisted, the early-season matchups against Wall have been beneficial to his development. He called Wall \u201ca mentor\u201d and said he talks to Wall more than any other player in the league, save for his teammates on the Kings and former players at his alma mater, the University of Kentucky.\nFox said Wall has urged him to \u201cstay working, stay humble.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get down when you\u2019re losing,\u201d Fox said Wall told him. \u201cThis is something top picks go through all the time.\u201d\nWall has been in Fox\u2019s position before. Both guards are lightning-quick Kentucky products who are devastating in the open court. Both came into the league on struggling teams.\nIn Wall\u2019s first three years in the NBA, the Wizards failed to win 30 games in a single season. After Fox\u2019s first 13 professional games, the Kings sit at an underwhelming 3-10.\nBrooks also saw his fair share of losing in his first few years coaching the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nBrooks began the 2008-09 season as an assistant to P.J. Carlesimo. After a 1-12 start to the year though, Brooks assumed coaching duties. Despite the coaching change, the losing continued. The Thunder would lose 17 of their next 19 games, and finish the year at 23-59, despite boasting a feisty, rookie point guard you may have heard of: Russell Westbrook.\nBrooks offered Fox some advice.\n\u201cThe only way you get better in this league is by giving great effort every day,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy way, there\u2019s no vitamins you can take to be a better player. You gotta do it with the hard work and grind.\u201d\nAlthough Fox may not have the same ferocity around the rim that Wall and Westbrook have shown from the onset of their careers, he certainly has their speed. And unfortunately for him, the same lack of winning that they suffered through, too.\nGiven the Kings\u2019 extremely young core \u2013 eight of their featured players have less than two years of experience in the league \u2013 the jury is still out on how they will fare in coming years.\nAnd although the Kings won\u2019t play the Wizards again until next year, Fox anticipates the next matchup against fellow Kentucky alumnus Wall.\n\u201c(I\u2019ll have) a year of experience, a year of getting my body right, getting my body even more NBA-ready,\u201d Fox said. \u201cJust being able to say: \u2018I\u2019ve played against him before, I know what he\u2019s going to do,\u2019 but you still have to go out there and play.\u201d\nRegardless of how the Kings fare this year, studying from Wall will certainly serve Fox well and he acknowledged as much.\n\u201c(Wall) just talks about going through it and being able to power through it from a point guard\u2019s perspective,\u201d Fox said. \u201cNow (the Wizards) are one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference.\u201d",

    "summary": "Despite feeling ill and not having proper warm-up due to receiving IVs, John Wall led the Wizards to a 113-94 victory over the Hawks with strong defensive plays, including chase-down blocks and limiting Dennis Schroeder to 2-16 shooting. Wall's focus on defense has improved his conditioning and overall game, aligning with Kobe Bryant\u2019s challenge for him to make the All-NBA Defensive Team.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 John Wall was up to his usual antics Saturday night.\nAtlanta Hawks guard Kent Bazemore thought he had a clear path to the hoop in transition, only to have his shot turned away by a soaring Wall. Wall has now had emphatic chase-down blocks in back-to-back Wizards games after spiking a would-be Brandon Ingram on Thursday against the Lakers.\nDefense was a point of emphasis all night for Wall, who despite pregame sickness, catalyzed a 113-94 Washington win over the Hawks by holding Atlanta\u2019s leading scorer, Dennis Schroeder, to a 2-16 shooting night.\nLong-heralded as one of the league\u2019s better defensive point guards, Wall has finished no lower than second in blocks per game amongst point guards each year since 2014, but he has only one All-NBA Defensive Team selection to show for it.\nLast June, Wall scoffed at the notion that he should be left off the team.\nSo in late August, when Kobe Bryant issued a directive to Wall via Twitter \u2013 \u201c1st team all defense\u201d \u2013 he was ready for the challenge.\n\u201cI challenged myself before then, so it was kinda great getting the challenge from \u2018The Mamba,\u2019\u201d Wall said, referring to the Laker guard\u2019s nickname.\nWall has focused on staying in plays more often and asserting himself as a better two-way player. That concerted effort has helped other areas of his game too, he contends.\n\u201cIt kinda helps me get in better shape and not get tired as quick,\u201d Wall said.\nOn a night like Saturday, when Wall was \u201cvery sick\u201d and wore a ski mask upon entering the arena, that conditioning proved particularly helpful. Wall, who didn\u2019t get to warm up because he received two IVs, admitted he didn\u2019t have the same energy or burst he normally does.\n\u201cMy migraines came back and I had a cold on top of that,\u201d Wall explained.\nNonetheless, Wall was proud of his play Saturday night.\n\u201cI thought I played OK,\u201d said Wall, who has drawn a poor shooting night from the opposition\u2019s point guard in Washington\u2019s last two games, after holding Lakers point guard Lonzo Ball to a 3-12 clip Thursday.\nDefense has been a point of concentration all year for the Wizards, who have conceded over 110 points to the sub-.500 Dallas Mavericks and Phoenix Suns, and a 130-point scoring barrage to the Cleveland Cavaliers. All of those disappointing performances were at home.\nBut Wall had an optimistic outlook, given the improved defense the Wizards have shown from the latter part of this home stand.\n\u201cIf we can just stick to the basics of our concepts,\u201d Wall said, \u201cI like our chances against anybody.\u201d\nSick or not, the point guard will certainly play a large role in how well that defense fares going forward.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 John Carlson registered his second two-point game in three contests in the Capitals\u2019 4-1 win against Pittsburgh at Capital One Arena Friday.\nThe 27-year-old defenseman quarterbacked an efficient Washington power play that scored twice, first on a Carlson slap shot in the first period and late in the second on a T.J. Oshie redirect of a Carlson point shot.\nOshie\u2019s goal gave the Capitals a lead that would last, as Washington kept Pittsburgh off the scoresheet for the game\u2019s final 31 minutes.\nThrough the Capitals\u2019 first 17 games, the 27-year-old defenseman is third in average ice time in the NHL, playing just over 27 minutes per night. Friday\u2019s contest marked the fourth time this season Carlson has played at least 28 minutes in a game.\nWith Matt Niskanen missing his twelfth consecutive game with an upper body injury, Carlson has been relied on to play lengthy and often difficult minutes for a depleted Capitals\u2019 defensive corps. The task was made no easier by Washington\u2019s opponent Friday, who boast some of the league\u2019s premier offensive talent.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you ever get used to it, I think you just try to manage it, you try to make sure that you\u2019re bringing the energy and enthusiasm,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s easy to make little mistakes sometimes, obviously, when you\u2019re playing that much. Sometimes easier things get harder and mentally you just have to be prepared and accept the challenge and go after it. I don\u2019t think you can float your way through games.\u201d\nCarlson has also shouldered a heavier offensive burden for the team and now has 13 points on the season, tenth-best among defenseman.\n\u201cI think he plays well, plays better when he\u2019s playing more, one of those players,\u201d said goalie Braden Holtby, who recorded his 200th career win Friday. \u201cSo it\u2019s not a surprise to any of us that he\u2019s playing the way he is and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to need [from] him the rest of the year and that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to bring because he\u2019s that type of player.\u201d\nOshie scored his second-period goal with one second remaining on a four-minute power play, a rare opportunity afforded to Washington after Kris Letang was called for two separate minor penalties on the same sequence.\n\u201cIt was one of those things where you get one of those long, lengthy power plays and you come out empty, the other team maybe gets a little momentum,\u201d Barry Trotz said. \u201cWe scored right at the end and any momentum that they may have had sort of dissipated real quickly.\u201d\nThe Capitals carried a 2-1 advantage into the second intermission and killed off two consecutive Penguins\u2019 power plays early in the third that helped tilt momentum even further in Washington\u2019s favor.\nThird period goals from rookies Chandler Stephenson and Jakub Vrana cemented the victory, the team\u2019s fourth win in their past five games.\n\u201cI think we just [have] to see what we\u2019re doing positively, see the things we\u2019re doing real well,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cWe talked about them in the beginning of the year, we just didn\u2019t execute them. The better our execution gets, the easier it is to play, the more fun it is to play and the more successful.\u201d",

    "summary": "Jay Gruden relied heavily on his pre-existing relationships from his time working with his brother Jon Gruden to build his coaching staff for Washington\u2019s NFL franchise, demonstrating the importance of networking in the NFL. Despite this, he did not bring anyone from his more recent stint with Marvin Lewis' Bengals staff to Washington.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 When Jay Gruden was named head coach of Washington\u2019s NFL franchise in 2014, he set out to construct a winning coaching staff.\nTo do that, he drew on pre-existing relationships in the \u201ccoaching social network\u201d he established during his decade as an assistant coach under his brother Jon Gruden in Tampa Bay and Marvin Lewis in Cincinnati, a Capital News Service social network analysis found.\nIn the NFL, who you know often matters as much as what you know, with coaches demonstrating a strong preference for familiar people. It\u2019s not unusual for one coach to work with another coach on multiple teams, creating a complex web of connections that spans generations.\nFor Jay Gruden, some parts of his coaching web have proved more important in filling open jobs in Washington. To build his staff \u2014 and replace assistants who departed for bigger jobs elsewhere \u2014 he has drawn more heavily on the network he established working for his brother\u2019s Buccaneers between 2002 and 2008 than the network he built as an assistant with the Bengals under Lewis between 2011 and 2013, the analysis found. In fact, he hasn\u2019t brought anyone from Lewis\u2019 Bengals staff to Washington.\nTo do the analysis, Capital News Service built a dataset that included every coach and assistant who has ever worked in the NFL with Jon Gruden and Lewis. We then selected everyone from that list who later became an NFL head coach \u2014 13 people, including Jay Gruden, Sean McVay and Kyle Shanahan \u2014 and added all of their NFL colleagues to the dataset.\nHere are five other interesting things we found looking into the web of connections around Jon Gruden and Lewis.\n1. Jon Gruden and Lewis have had a lasting impact on the league as mentors.\nSuccessful coaches create opportunities for their top assistants to land head coaching gigs elsewhere.\nNine people who worked for Jon Gruden during his four years as head coach in Oakland and Tampa Bay later became head coaches. This includes Shanahan (San Francisco 49ers), Raheem Morris (formerly Tampa Bay Buccaneers), Sean McVay (Los Angeles Rams), Marc Trestman (formerly Chicago Bears), Bill Callahan (formerly Oakland Raiders), Gus Bradley (formerly Jacksonville Jaguars), Mike Tomlin (Pittsburgh Steelers) and Rod Marinelli (formerly Detroit Lions).\nThe visualization below shows the network of relationships between Jon Gruden, those nine people \u2014 and every assistant coach any of them worked with. The dense, interconnected nature of this network is striking, showing a surprising number of assistant coaches who worked with each other on different teams.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never seen a social network visualization before, here\u2019s how to interpret it (and subsequent visualizations in this story).\n\nEach dot is a person. Bigger dots are more important parts of the network, as measured by a statistic called \u201ccentrality.\u201d Head coaches are the biggest, with lots of common connections. Medium sized circles are the most important assistants, people who show up repeatedly on the staffs of several head coaches. The smaller dots are less important people.\nEach line is a connection between two people. People who have worked together for many years have a stronger tie and, thus, a thicker line.\nThe colors identify \u201ccommunities\u201d in the network, clusters of people with lots of overlapping connections between them, and fewer connections to other parts of the network. Jay Gruden and McVay (offensive coordinator under Jay Gruden in Washington) have a lot of overlapping connections, which puts them in the same red-colored community.\n\nFive people who worked for Lewis have gone onto head coaching gigs in the NFL: Jay Gruden, Mike Zimmer (Minnesota Vikings), Hue Jackson (Cleveland Browns), Vance Joseph (Denver Broncos) and Leslie Frazier (formerly of the Minnesota Vikings).\n\n2. Latching onto a veteran coach can help inexperienced assistants move up the ranks.\nThe progression of McVay from an assistant coach to offensive coordinator to head coach illustrates how a coach\u2019s network influences his NFL career.\nJay Gruden and McVay first worked together in Tampa Bay in 2008, as coaching assistants. In 2009, after the Buccaneers fired Jon Gruden, Jay Gruden and McVay worked for the United Football League\u2019s Florida Tuskers as offensive coordinator and tight ends coach, respectively.\nIn 2010, McVay joined Washington\u2019s coaching staff when Mike Shanahan became head coach. He worked under offensive coordinator Shanahan, who also spent time under Jon Gruden\u2019s Buccaneers, but left before McVay arrived. When Jay Gruden took over for Mike Shanahan in 2014, he promoted McVay from tight ends coach to offensive coordinator.\nIn Washington in 2010, McVay first worked with then-quarterbacks coach Matt LaFleur. He became McVay\u2019s offensive coordinator in Los Angeles when McVay took the reins this year. LaFleur worked with three different head coaches in the network we examined in three different cities \u2014 McVay (Washington, L.A.), Shanahan (Washington, Atlanta) and Morris (Washington, Atlanta).\n\n3. Relationships help fired coaches get back on their feet.\nJoe Barry, who has held NFL defensive coaching positions for most of the last two decades, has deep ties to the head coaches that make up the extended Jon Gruden network. These connections helped Barry get back to the league after the Detroit Lions fired him as defensive coordinator after the team\u2019s winless 2008 season.\nIn 2009, he returned to Tampa Bay as linebackers coach under new head coach Raheem Morris. They had both worked together in Tampa Bay from 2002-2005 under Jon Gruden. Barry was one of the most important pieces of the network we examined, with ties to eight head coaches. He served as Jay Gruden\u2019s defensive coordinator in Washington for two years before being fired.\n\nGreg Olson also used the Jon Gruden coaching network to get a new job after being fired from Oakland as offensive coordinator in 2014. He caught on with the Jacksonville Jaguars as offensive coordinator in 2015 under head coach Gus Bradley, who he worked with in Tampa Bay in 2008. Bradley and Olson were both fired in 2016. This year, Olson signed on with an old Tampa Bay colleague \u2014 McVay \u2014 as quarterbacks coach in Los Angeles.\n\n4. One way to acquire lots of connections is to stay in one spot for a long time, as head coaches come and go.\nIt may seem obvious, but the longer an assistant stays in the NFL, the more connections they typically acquire. We found that some of the most connected people in our network \u2014 the ones with the most ties to different head coaches \u2014 were people with long tenures in the league.\nDanny Smith landed his first job in the NFL as a special teams coach was with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1995, where he worked with offensive coordinator Jon Gruden and Callahan, the offensive line coach. He moved to Detroit, then Buffalo, before settling in Washington from 2004-2012, where he worked for three different head coaches and assistants Shanahan, McVay and Morris. He later moved to Tomlin\u2019s staff in Pittsburgh, showing that good special teams coaches are never lack for work.\n\nRichard Mann, a veteran wide receivers coach who started in the NFL in 1982, also exemplifies the idea that longevity helps build connections. He has direct ties to 11 of the 15 coaches in the data set we built. He established most of his ties to Jon Gruden\u2019s coaching network while working in Tampa Bay from 2002-2009. He also has crossover ties to Lewis\u2019 coaching network, formed when he worked with Lewis on the Baltimore Ravens\u2019 staff in 1997 and 1998.\n\n\n5. Marvin Lewis keeps his people for a long time.\nLewis became the Bengals head coach in 2003, and he\u2019s earned a reputation for low staff turnover. When his assistants leave, it\u2019s usually because of a promotion to a better job elsewhere, or retirement. He rarely fires people.\nIn the visualization below, the orange relationship lines between Lewis and his assistants are thick because they spent so many years working together.\n\nCincinnati assistants like Darrin Simmons (special teams), Paul Guenther (defensive coordinator) and Jonathan Hayes (tight ends) have all been on Lewis\u2019 staff for 14 years, with little worry about job security. If an assistant sticks to a loyal coach who is unlikely to get fired \u2014 like Lewis \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have to worry about losing his job.\nThe lines connecting Jay Gruden to the network of Cincinnati assistants are much thinner, indicating weaker ties. It\u2019s notable that in Washington, he hasn\u2019t hired anyone from Lewis\u2019s Cincinnati staff.",

    "content": "BALTIMORE- Over the past two weeks, the Baltimore Ravens have received lots of criticism from fans and some public officials for kneeling during the national anthem before the Sept. 24th game against the Jacksonville Jaguars and kneeling and praying before the anthem ahead of Sunday\u2019s kickoff against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\u201cThey need to keep it out of the workplace,\u201d Hartford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said in an interview with Capital News Service. \u201cI would be the first one to support their right to protest outside of football, they just need to protect their brand of playing good football.\u201d\nBut Baltimore City Councilman Brandon Scott thinks the football field is the perfect place to protest inequalities and injustices people of color are facing across the country. \n\u201cDon\u2019t be tricked: this is about race, the thing we don\u2019t like to talk about,\u201d Scott said. \nIn the city where Francis Scott Key penned \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d the NFL players\u2019 show of protest, as in other cities, has roiled fans who agree with President Donald Trump that teams are disrespecting the anthem, the flag and the military. On the other side, players and their defenders insist their protests mean no disrespect but rather are being misinterpreted: the main point is to show support for social justice, to underscore concerns about police brutality, and to reaffirm the right to free expression despite criticism from the White House.\nTen Baltimore Ravens, including linebackers Terrell Suggs and C.J. Mosley, along with wide receiver Mike Wallace, took a knee and head coach John Harbaugh locked arms with the rest of his team before their game against Jacksonville in London. Former Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis also joined the team in taking a knee before the game.\nBefore Sunday\u2019s game against Pittsburgh, the entire Ravens team knelt before the anthem to pray, but stood for the playing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Their prayer was met with boos booming throughout the stadium and some fans even left after seeing players kneel.\nOnly 52 players nationwide took a knee during the anthem before last Sunday\u2019s games, a substantial drop from almost 200 players kneeling the previous week.\nTrump called for NFL team owners to fire the players that wouldn\u2019t stand for the anthem.\nRavens tight end Ben Watson took to Twitter the day before the Jacksonville game to respond to Trump\u2019s comments.\n\u201cIt is a sad day when the POTUS seeks to disregard and punish American citizens for peacefully exercising their constitutional rights,\u201d Watson tweeted.\nRavens owner Steve Bisciotti released a statement saying he supported his players \u201c100 percent.\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing (that) it\u2019s getting talked about,\u201d Harbaugh said after the London game. \u201cI think it\u2019s something that\u2019s a positive. It\u2019s not going to be easy. It\u2019s going to be painful. It\u2019s a tough conversation, but as for us here, I love our players and I support our players. A team is about unity.\u201d \nThe controversy was sparked more than a year ago when former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality. \nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., responded to the recent protests by tweeting: \u201cDemocracy. Freedom of speech. Freedom of expression. The power of \u2018We the People\u2019 wanting to encourage a more perfect union.\u201d\nSome Ravens season ticket holders have even cancelled their season tickets. \nGeorge Reda, whose season seats went back to the days of the Baltimore Colts, wrote to Bisciotti that \u201cI know we all have the right in this great country to dissent and disagree with things that we don\u2019t agree with, but the football field is not the proper place.\u201d\nReda added he didn\u2019t even watch Sunday\u2019s game against Pittsburgh and took his Ravens sticker off his car.\nJoey Odoms, the Ravens\u2019 singer for the national anthem, resigned after the the Jaguars game \u2013 not because the team knelt but, he said, because of the hatred and disapproval sown to the team by the fans after the protest. \nOdoms, a former combat veteran, released a statement on Facebook explaining his decision to resign.\n\u201cFans who attack players for protesting, (a right in which I fought to defend) but are simply not interested in understanding why, is the reason I am resigning,\u201d Odoms said.\nGahler aired his displeasure at the kneeling on his Facebook page.\n\u201cThe embarrassment that is the NFL continues and people wonder why I am on strike\u201d against the league games, Gahler said. \u201cRavens join the nonsense of taking knee while on the soil of the Country we gained our independence from.\u201d\nGahler told CNS that when players are in uniform they constitute a team, not individuals.\n\u201cYou have \u00a0a First Amendment right outside your job but the NFL is endorsing it by allowing the disrespect of our flag,\u201d Gahler said.\nNo matter how the public perceives the Ravens stance, protesting players are not backing down.\n\u201cWe stand with our brothers. They have the right to protest and we knelt with them,\u201d Suggs said. \u201cNon-violent protest is as American as it gets. We knelt with them to let them know we\u2019re a unified front. There is no dividing us.\u201d",

They also bond off-court through video games like NBA 2K, Madden, and FIFA, fostering a growing chemistry on and off the court.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Tim Frazier and Jodie Meeks, who joined the Washington Wizards this summer, will do more than share a backcourt this season. They\u2019re neighbors off the court, too. Frazier and Meeks moved into the same building this summer and live a few floors apart.\n\u201cWe hang out from time to time and play video games, try to get acquainted,\u201d said Meeks at the team\u2019s preseason media day Monday, adding they specifically play NBA 2K, Madden and FIFA. \u201cHe\u2019s my point guard now, so I want him to look for me as many times as possible.\u201d\nAway from virtual basketball and on the real hardcourt, Frazier (a point guard) and Meeks (shooting guard) need their acquaintance to develop into easy chemistry. Their new jobs are to back up Washington\u2019s star guards, John Wall and Bradley Beal. The Wizards hope the two new arrivals will provide more stability to their second-string backcourt and improve their bench production in 2017 and beyond.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re off to a good start,\u201d Frazier said.\nLast season, Wall and Beal were generally relieved by point guard Trey Burke (12.3 minutes per game in 57 appearances) and shooting guard Marcus Thornton (17.4 minutes per game in 33 appearances). The Wizards also signed point guard Brandon Jennings in March, who helped through the late-season push and the playoffs. None of those players are on the squad this year.\nTo take their places, the Wizards traded their second-round draft pick (52nd overall) to New Orleans to acquire Frazier, then signed Meeks to a two-year deal in free agency.\nWashington\u2019s non-starters were among the league\u2019s least productive last season. The team was second-worst in total bench minutes, points and assists; 25th of 30 teams in bench points per 36 minutes (63.4); and 24th in bench assists per 36 minutes (12.8), according to realgm.com. (Judging by 36 minutes is a way to measure production per minute played, rather than per game.)\nThe Wizards\u2019 need for better bench production didn\u2019t seem lost on Frazier.\n\u201cI think it goes the whole way with our second unit,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cObviously, I will have the ball in my hands, so I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for everybody, how they work, how they feel, where they want the ball and whatever I can do to help the team win.\u201d\nIf Meeks scores and Frazier distributes the ball the way they did for their previous teams, that overall bench production ought to improve. Frazier is more of a traditional passing point guard, in contrast with the man he\u2019s replacing, Burke, a scorer. Frazier averaged 7.9 assists per 36 minutes for the Pelicans last season, much higher than Burke\u2019s 5.1 per 36.\nWizards head coach Scott Brooks said he considers Frazier, who entered the NBA as an undrafted free agent, \u201cas tough a competitor as there is in the league\u201d after spending time around him during the summer.\nMeeks, meanwhile, scored 16.0 points per 36 minutes for the Orlando Magic last year, a better mark than Thornton\u2019s 13.7 and Burke\u2019s 14.6 for Washington. Meeks is also known for his touch beyond the arc, so he can maintain the Wizards\u2019 supply of three-pointers whenever he enters for Beal.\n\u201cJodie Meeks is one of the best shooters in the game,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cHe\u2019s had some unfortunate injuries the last few years. Hopefully we can keep him healthy and on the court. If you can do that, he spaces the floor as well as anybody in the league. He\u2019s a 40 percent three-point shooter and he can knock down four or five in a quarter.\u201d\nTo be precise, Meeks shot .409 from three for Orlando last year and averaged .388 over the last four seasons. That\u2019s useful compared to the 2016-17 league average of .358 and Thornton\u2019s mark last season of .350.\nMeeks and Frazier also outstrip the former Wizards in the advanced metrics of \u201coffensive rating,\u201d which estimates how many points a player produces in 100 possessions, and \u201cdefensive rating,\u201d which estimates how many points a player allows per 100 possessions.\n\n\nMeeks\u2019 107 offensive rating essentially means he is five percent more productive on offense than Thornton was. Frazier, with his three years of NBA experience, replaces the two-man band-aid of Burke and Jennings at the cost of a late-second-round pick. And this doesn\u2019t come at the expense of defense, as Meeks and Frazier fall in the same range of defensive rating as their predecessors.\nHaving a more productive bench would make Washington\u2019s starters\u2019 lives more comfortable. Forward Otto Porter Jr. is excited for the additions.\n\u201cJodie brings a lot to the table. He\u2019s a veteran guy, a professional, the three-point shooter that we need,\u201d Porter said. \u201cTim, he\u2019s a guy that has great experience. As a backup for John, he\u2019s gonna do great.\u201d\nPorter said he and his teammates have had some time to get to know Frazier and Meeks during the offseason.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely got guys that can come in and impact the game off the bat,\u201d Porter said. \u201cJust playing with them over the summer, you can kinda already tell that they\u2019re picking (things) up, getting close to guys, and we\u2019re making it easy for them to transition to helping this team.\u201d",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 When the head coach of the United States Hockey League\u2019s Youngstown Phantoms picked up the team\u2019s newest player \u2014 Nathan Walker, a little-known Australian who had been playing in the Czech Republic \u2014 at the airport in 2013, Walker had been on a nearly 24-hour-trip from Prague to Warsaw to New York City to Cleveland.\nBoarding the team bus for an 8-hour ride from Cleveland to a game that night in Chicago, the coach, Anthony Noreen, assured Walker he wasn\u2019t expected to play because of jet lag.\n\u201cHe pretty much looked at me and said, \u2018Coach, I came here to play hockey,\u2019\u201d said Noreen, who provided details of Walker\u2019s trip in an interview. \u201cLike, \u2018I\u2019m ready, you don\u2019t ever have to worry about me being ready no matter the situation.\u2019\u201d\nThat night, Noreen penciled Walker into the lineup for his first USHL game against the Chicago Steel. And on his very shift, Walker scored, splitting two Steel players at the blue line before blowing past another defender on his way to the goal.\n\n\u201cI just think from the second he got there he had a mission,\u201d Noreen said. \u201cHis mission was to play in the NHL and he just wasn\u2019t going to be denied.\u201d\nFour years later, after logging thousands of miles in the American Hockey League and coming back from two season-ending injuries, the 23-year-old forward is on the verge of making the Washington Capitals\u2019 opening-night roster.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to give everything I can to make the team,\u201d Walker said at the team\u2019s media day earlier this month. \u201cIf it happens, it happens. If it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll just keep working until eventually, hopefully it [does].\u201d\nPassed over completely in the 2012 and 2013 drafts, the five-foot-nine Walker was selected by Washington with the 89th pick in his final draft-eligible year. Walker has showcased his speed and penalty-killing ability during the preseason, emerging as a compelling candidate to make the team. Should he, Walker would become the first ever Australian to play in the NHL.\nWalker was born in Cardiff, Great Britain, but raised in Australia after his family relocated when he was two-years-old. After seeing the Mighty Ducks movies and watching his older brother play ice hockey, Walker took up the sport. As a teenager, he convinced his parents to let him move overseas in order to play more often and against tougher competition.\nHe spent parts of six seasons playing in the Czech Republic before joining Youngstown for the second half of their season.\n\u201cWhen you find out his story, that he moved away from home into a foreign country where he didn\u2019t speak the language at the age of 15 and he was living on his own to play hockey and chase his dream, obviously he\u2019s going to be a little bit more mature than your average 18-year-old, 19-year-old,\u201d Noreen said.\nWalker played 29 games with the Phantoms, scoring 27 points before a broken bone in his neck ended his season. Walker acclimated to the Youngstown locker room so quickly that his teammates unanimously voted him team captain for the following year.\n\u201cAnytime it\u2019s a guy like that, no matter where you\u2019re from and what the cultural difference is, I think when you play that hard and you work that hard, guys seem to look up to you and guys tend to want to bring you into the group pretty quickly,\u201d Noreen said. \u201cHe was part of the group almost instantly.\u201d\nAfter attending Capitals development camp and training camp on a tryout basis, Walker ultimately never returned to Youngstown, accepting a contract with Washington\u2019s AHL affiliate in Hershey for the 2013-2014 season. He scored 11 points in 43 games with the Bears, prompting the Capitals to trade back into the third round of the 2014 draft to pick him.\nExcluding an injury-shortened season in 2015, in which he tore his ACL, Walker\u2019s numbers have steadily climbed, culminating with a career-best 17 goals and 24 assists in 2016. Walker was being considered for his first NHL call-up last January during the NHL All-Star break, according to Capitals head coach Barry Trotz, until he broke his hand blocking a shot.\nWalker, who is listed at 186 pounds, is undersized compared to the NHL average, but employs a high-energy and physical style of play. The Australian scored the lone goal in the Capitals\u2019 first preseason game against New Jersey Sept. 18.\n\u201cHe just continues to become a better player,\u201d Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan said at the team\u2019s media day earlier this month. \u201cBetter positionally, reads the game better, more intelligent on his reads, instead of being a pure energy player.\u201d\nFor the first time in two years, the Capitals have spots available in their lineup entering training camp after six players left the team during the offseason. Walker is competing for one of the two expected openings on the fourth line alongside center Jay Beagle. The Capitals trimmed down their roster to 30 players Tuesday, with Walker still in Washington.\n\u201cSometimes you\u2019re just around guys when you coach long enough and play long enough, you\u2019re just around certain guys where you just know that they\u2019re going to find a way somehow to make it,\u201d Noreen said. \u201cAnd there was no doubt that after spending a couple days around him and especially the rest of that season, that he was going to be one of those guys that would find a way to make it.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Baltimore Orioles are the only Major League Baseball team that did not sign any international players this summer, lagging behind a trend where over 350 international players were signed by other teams. The team's focus remains predominantly on domestic talent, influenced by ownership and management philosophy, making it easier to invest in well-scouted U.S.-based prospects.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 The Baltimore Orioles are lagging way behind the rest of Major League Baseball in signing international players, a Capital News Service analysis found.\nAs the game becomes increasingly global, the Orioles were the lone team in the majors not to dip into the international market this summer, per Baseball America. Conversely, the San Diego Padres signed a league-high 34 international players, and the Orioles\u2019 American League East rival Boston Red Sox inked 31.\nMore than 350 international players signed contracts with major league teams this summer, according to Baseball America. Most of these players are from Venezuela and the Dominican Republic, but signees also come from places like the Bahamas, Australia and the Netherlands.\n\n\nBaltimore, however, has consistently shied away from the international market.\nOf the 12 Orioles position players to appear in at least 60 games this season, only Jonathan Schoop is an international signing, coming out of Curacao in 2008. Only two of the 12 most used pitchers on the team were international signings \u2013 Ubaldo Jim\u00e9nez and Miguel Castro \u2013 and neither were originally signed by Baltimore. Anthony Santander, originally signed out of Venezuela by Cleveland in 2011, is the only international representative in the Orioles\u2019 top ten prospects, according to mlbpipeline.com.\nThe team\u2019s domestic focus can be traced to the philosophy of the team\u2019s ownership and management. For the Orioles, it may be easier to convince owner Peter Angelos to pay the signing bonus for a well-scouted high school or college draftee such as Manny Machado, than to dish out money for a little-known Dominican or Venezuelan player, said Jeffrey Paternostro, a senior prospect writer for Baseball Prospectus.\n\u201cEvery team has a budget, both for the major league team and player development, and they have to decide where to allocate those resources,\u201d Paternostro said. \u201cTeams like the Yankees and Padres have been very aggressive in [the international] market\u2026but there are some teams, like the White Sox before and the Orioles now, that just will not spend money there.\u201d\nUnlike U.S. and Canadian high school and college players, foreign-born players are not eligible for the MLB draft that is held every June. Instead, they are eligible to sign free agent contracts with teams starting as young as 16.\nSigning players that young can be a gamble, Paternostro said, but one that many teams are willing to take.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know what a 16-year-old is going to look like physically at 22. It\u2019s not easy at 18 either for [high school] players, but you have two more years of information and a better amateur track record to go on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, you\u2019re getting them earlier, so you can get them into your system earlier.\u201d\nThe signing window opens each year on July 2, and each team starts with a bonus pool of $4.75 million to sign international players, while low-revenue and small market teams have a chance to begin with up to $5.75 million, as laid out in MLB\u2019s collective bargaining agreement.\nTeams can use this money to sign international free agents that are younger than 25 and have fewer than six years of foreign professional experience. Or they can choose to trade their funds away to other teams, as the Orioles have done recently.\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, they have traded away international bonus money on nine different occasions this year. Only one of the players they\u2019ve received in return has seen the majors this season: Jeremy Hellickson, who has a 7.29 ERA in nine starts since coming to Baltimore from the Phillies on July 29.\nThe Orioles declined to comment. But General Manager Dan Duquette explained the reasoning behind the trades to the Baltimore Sun in August.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been utilizing the international slot money to help us acquire some pitching to help our team,\u201d Duquette told the Sun. \u201cA lot of the other clubs will invest it in pitching to help us in the future or players to help us in the future. We use it to try to strengthen our pitching staff now while we have a window of opportunity with the position players we have here. That\u2019s just utilizing a trade resource to impact your team now rather than three, four, five years down the road.\u201d\n\n\nBaltimore stands to miss out by avoiding the international market, as these signings can turn into some of the game\u2019s best players. Houston Astros\u2019 second baseman Jose Altuve, the MLB position player leader in WAR (Wins Above Replacement) per Fangraphs, was signed as an international free agent out of Venezuela in 2007. Jose Ramirez, the young star at the center of the surging Cleveland Indians, signed out of the Dominican Republic in 2009. Schoop has been the Orioles\u2019 best player this season, leading the team in WAR, OPS, batting average and RBIs.\nIn fact, of the 70 MLB All-Stars in 2017, 17 of them originally signed as international free agents. On the whole, 32 percent of the league is international. The future of the game is increasingly global, too. As of September, six of the top ten mlbpipeline.com prospects have international origins.\nThe Orioles have made the postseason three times since 2012, but sit seven games under .500 and five and a half out of a playoff spot as of September 21. For a team with a farm system that consistently ranks in the lower third of baseball, and the impending free agency of Adam Jones and Manny Machado, they are seemingly on the brink of a rebuild. Whether or not they choose to invest in international talent as a part of this remains to be seen.",

Fans like Sally Adams are optimistic about the team's chances this year, especially with key players such as Stephen Strasburg, Max Scherzer, and Gio Gonzalez leading the charge.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A curse has tormented sports fans in Washington since its NFL football franchise\u2019s Super Bowl victory in 1992 \u2013 but baseball fans in the nation\u2019s capital have suffered for even longer. \nWashington hasn\u2019t seen a World Series championship since 1924. It didn\u2019t help that the city had no baseball team from 1972 until the arrival of the Nationals in 2005. The Nats have made the playoffs three times each time with home-field advantage in the divisional series, only to squander each opportunity. \nTheir 89-57 record as of Sept. 15 puts them just 5.5 games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers for the National League\u2019s top spot, despite facing a 14-game deficit less than three weeks ago. With Los Angeles reeling and coming into town this weekend, Washington could make serious headway in obtaining home-field advantage once again throughout the playoffs.\n\nThis year, however, some Nationals fans believe their team is poised to come away with more than just the participation trophies they earned in 2012, 2014 and 2016. \nSally Adams is a 64-year-old St. Louis native who has lived in northern Virginia for 30 years, and has since become a Nationals fan. She said seeing her new team lose to her childhood Cardinals in 2012 spurred her to continue buying tickets.  \n\u201cI think this is the year,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThey have had all the tools\u2026They have to do it this year. There would be no excuses if they can\u2019t move forward. I know it\u2019s a game, but c\u2019mon.\u201d\nBarring a late-season injury, the Nationals will have Stephen Strasburg, who has only pitched in one postseason game in his career because of a controversial innings limit in 2012 and an elbow injury last year. \nStrasburg\u2019s presence will be a welcome one. He joins Max Scherzer and Gio Gonzalez in the top four in the league in opponent batting average against and top 10 in left-on-base percentage.\nThough it\u2019s unclear when Bryce Harper will return, the Nationals have thrived in his absence, and could still very well be an October threat without him.\nEven without Harper\u2019s bat for 39 games, the Nationals remain tied for 5th in the league with a wRC+ of 101, their best such mark in their four division title years. The Dodgers, meanwhile, are fourth in the league with a mark of 104. wRC+, according to mlb.com, is a variation of Runs Created that adjusts \u201cto account for important external factors \u2014 like ballpark or era.\u201d\nHarper, who has been sidelined since Aug. 13 with a knee injury, has posted MVP-caliber splits this season (.326 BA/29 HR/87 RBI), but Washington has still mustered an 18-11 record in his absence.\nIt\u2019s that depth that has 58-year-old season-ticket holder Chuck Workman excited.\n\u201cThese guys just never seem to give up, no matter who they put in,\u201d Workman said. \u201cAnd you just get the feeling \u2013 every game when I\u2019m sitting in there I get the feeling they\u2019re going to win. If they\u2019re down, they\u2019re gonna win.\u201d\nLifelong Washington baseball fan Vyron Johnson also expressed optimism about the Nats\u2019 playoff chances, even in the face of Harper\u2019s uncertain status, citing the team\u2019s improved bullpen.\n\nIn the first half of the season, Washington\u2019s relievers ranked 29th in the league in Fielding Independent Pitching, a pitching metric that aims to diminish a defense\u2019s impact on a pitcher\u2019s season. But since the All-Star game, the Nats have been fifth-best in that category, according to FanGraphs. \nFielding Independent Pitching values high strikeout rates, and is most negatively affected by walks and home runs surrendered.\nGiven the Dodgers\u2019 recent slide, the National League suddenly appears up for grabs, and this weekend could reveal much about the Nationals\u2019 chances to win the pennant.\nJohnson, 65, said he expects the Dodgers series to have a playoff feel to it and for the D.C. faithful to make their voices heard in Nationals Park this weekend. He said that in past seasons, Nationals fans could hardly be heard over the roars of fans cheering for opposing teams. \nNow? \u201cI think we\u2019re drowning them out,\u201d Johnson said with a smile.  \nJohnson predicted that if the Nationals were to win the World Series, Washington residents will \u201cparty all year long like (Chicago) did\u201d following the Cubs\u2019 World Series victory last year. \nYou know what they say\u2026party like it\u2019s 1924.",

    "summary": "Georgia Tech's use of the flexbone triple option offense, which nearly upset Tennessee, highlights its effectiveness as an equalizer in an era dominated by pass-first offenses. Navy, under Ken Niumatalolo, remains the most successful team running this system, emphasizing the importance of both the scheme and strong coaching.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 On college football\u2019s opening weekend, an old-school offensive system was on display yet again.\nGeorgia Tech brought 25th-ranked Tennessee to two overtimes and lost 42-41 only when they failed to make a game-winning two-point conversion. The Yellow Jackets became the fifth team since 2000 to lose a game despite gaining 500 yards rushing.\nIn an age of pass-first offenses, Georgia Tech is the only Power Five program to run the flexbone triple option offense. The system has been favored for decades by head coach Paul Johnson, who brought the philosophy to Atlanta from Navy \u2014 the Annapolis program which has been the winningest Division I team to run the fast-paced, run-heavy system.\nJohnson drew doubt across the country when Tech hired him in 2008, but in short order the flexbone was up and running at the Atlantic Coast Conference program.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just something we\u2019ve done for a long time and believe in and have had a lot of success doing at different schools,\u201d Johnson said this week. \u201cI used to wonder why more people didn\u2019t do it, because it\u2019s certainly a great equalizer and gives you a chance to be competitive, but to each their own.\u201d\nOnly seven Football Bowl Subdivision programs employ some version of the flexbone triple option: Georgia Tech, Navy, Army, Air Force, Georgia Southern, New Mexico and Tulane. Army beat Fordham 64-6 last Friday without completing a single pass. At New Mexico, after head coach Bob Davie arrived in 2012 and installed his version of the offense, the team snapped a seven-year bowl drought and appeared in bowl games in 2015 and 2016. But the winningest flexbone team of this generation is Navy, where Johnson had his first Division I FBS head coaching job from 2002 to 2007.\nNavy head coach Ken Niumatalolo has been in charge since Johnson\u2019s move to Tech. He believes credit for the Midshipmen\u2019s success should go to the personnel and coaching as much as the system.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a combination of everything. It all stems from the players, but it\u2019s an offense that works,\u201d Niumatalolo said this week.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather just win\u201d\nThe flexbone employs three running backs: a fullback behind the quarterback and two slotbacks called the \u201cA-back\u201d and \u201cB-back\u201d on either side of them. The quarterback can give the fullback a handoff up the middle (option one), he can carry the ball himself (option two) or he can pitch it to one of the slotbacks (option three). Flexbone offenses rely mainly on these choices and rarely throw the ball.\nIt goes by several names \u2014 Johnson refers to his system as the \u201cspread\u201d offense \u2014 but the term \u201cflexbone\u201d was coined by longtime Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry when he said he wanted his team to be more flexible in the wishbone formation, as Steve Gunther tells the story. Gunther has self-published several instructional books about coaching the flexbone and learned under Emory Bellard, who coached the system at Texas A&M and Mississippi State.\n\u201cEmory always used to say, \u2018These teams that throw for touchdowns all the time\u2026 for some reason those touchdowns, in the minds of the fans, count for more points,\u2019\u201d Gunther said. \u201c\u2018The last time I looked, it still counts six points (to run for a touchdown).\u2019\u201d\nNiumatalolo agreed, saying that the lack of passing didn\u2019t make the flexbone a \u201cgimmick\u201d offense.\n\u201cI think everybody wants to see the ball in the air,\u201d Niumatalolo said. \u201cI think sometimes athletic directors would rather see somebody throw the ball 50 times, and maybe feel like the fans want to see the ball thrown and not run, but I\u2019d rather just win.\u201d\nAnd teams like Navy certainly win. The seven FBS flexbone programs combined to go 54-36 in 2016, a .600 winning percentage, with five of the seven making bowl games. Johnson made the case for the advantage teams receive when they try something different.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the conference with Ohio State and Michigan and some of those schools, you\u2019re not gonna out-recruit those schools,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo you better not be doing the same thing they\u2019re doing. It doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense.\u201d\nTim Stowers, an offensive assistant under Paul Johnson at Georgia Southern in 1985 and 1986 and the author of \u201cCoaching Football\u2019s Spread Offense,\u201d put it another way.\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have superior talent, it allows you to move the ball against superior personnel,\u201d he said.\nThis fits the bill for service academies, which are at a disadvantage recruiting against other programs because of the post-graduation military service requirement. Also, because cadets and midshipmen must make a certain weight to pass physical readiness tests for graduation, the academies rarely have 300-pound linemen like most schools do. The flexbone prioritizes mobility over size on the offensive line because linemen must keep blocking for their runners as the play moves down the field. in the second layers of defenses.\nNiumatalolo clarified that his offense doesn\u2019t require \u201csmall\u201d linemen, saying Navy\u2019s are bigger now than they have ever been.\n\u201cYou have to be nimble, but to play anything in football nowadays on the [offensive line], we\u2019re looking for guys that can move,\u201d he said.\nNavy\u2019s starting offensive linemen for opening weekend averaged 287 pounds a man; in contrast, at the University of Maryland, which does not run the option, the average starter on the line opening weekend was 312 pounds. Johnson\u2019s recruits at Georgia Tech don\u2019t have to worry about making graduation weight the way Navy\u2019s do, yet the coach still uses slightly lighter offensive linemen: His opening day starters averaged out to 287 pounds, the same as Navy\u2019s.\nMobile Midshipmen\nThe height of the flexbone\u2019s popularity came in the 1970s, both Gunther and Stowers said, when Oklahoma and Alabama won national titles running it. In the 21st century, Navy has been the preeminent flexbone team.\nIn 2016, the Midshipmen scored 37.9 points per game, the highest total of all seven teams that run the flexbone, and they led the country with a whopping 61 rushing touchdowns compared to just nine passing touchdowns. Runs accounted for 87 percent of their offensive touchdowns, the widest discrepancy in FBS football.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Navy ran the ball the most often \u2014 Air Force led the country in rushing attempts in 2016 (810, when stats are adjusted so sacks aren\u2019t counted as rushing attempts). With that same adjustment, Army had the widest ratio of rushes to pass attempts \u2014 780 to 123 \u2014 meaning they called a run play 85.4 percent of the time. Navy was third in both categories.\nStill, Navy has won games with the flexbone the most consistently. Since 2008 \u2014 Johnson\u2019s first season at Georgia Tech and Niumatalolo\u2019s first year as head coach of Navy \u2014 the Midshipmen have been far and away the winningest service academy, finishing worse than 8-5 only once in nine seasons. With a winning percentage of .653, they edge out Georgia Tech\u2019s .611 over the same span.\nDuring that time period, Navy\u2019s competition only became tougher; the academy shifted from an independent to a football-only member of the American Athletic Conference in 2015, and they\u2019ve won four of eight bowl games they\u2019ve appeared in, including games against Power Five opponents Missouri and Pittsburgh.\n\u201cIt gives us the opportunity to win against people that, really, we have no business beating,\u201d Niumatalolo said.\nThis Saturday Navy faces conference foe Tulane. Niumatalolo said Tulane coach Willie Fritz\u2019s flexbone is slightly different than Navy\u2019s, as it operates from a zone-blocking scheme with receivers spread wide. The Midshipmen\u2019s coach, meanwhile, believes his team benefits from running hard up the middle.\n\u201cWhere people are zone-blocking, going east and west, we\u2019re going north and south,\u201d Niumatalolo said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting up the field, we\u2019re attacking people. So yes, schematically what we do is sound, but I feel like the physicality in how we do things also separates us.\u201d\nStowers believes some coaches \u201care scared of being labeled as an option coach\u201d for its stigma as a gimmick. A decade into Niumatalolo\u2019s tenure in Annapolis and Georgia Tech\u2019s flexbone journey with Johnson, it\u2019s clear some option coaches just plan to stick with what works for them.",

These departures account for a significant portion of the team's previous success, with only minimal reinforcements brought in to fill the void.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Following the Capitals\u2019 offseason exodus, the NHL\u2019s best regular-season team for the past two seasons could have a hard time replicating its recent dominance in the standings.\nDue to salary cap restraints, Washington was forced to let Karl Alzner, Kevin Shattenkirk and Justin Williams leave during free agency, and trade Marcus Johansson after a career year. The Capitals also lost defenseman Nate Schmidt in the expansion draft and chose not to resign fourth-line winger Daniel Winnik.\nIn total, these six players accounted for approximately 23 percent of the standing points the Capitals registered last season. But the team only acquired one fringe NHL player in an attempt to replace their value.\nThe NHL awards a team two points for a win of any kind, one point for an overtime or shootout loss and zero points for a regulation loss. The Capitals finished last season with 118 points, a league high by seven points.\nPoint Shares, an advanced metric, estimates the number of points in the standings an individual player contributed to a team. Last season, the team\u2019s 30 players combined for a total of 122.1 Point Shares, according to Hockey Reference. Alzner, Shattenkirk, Williams, Johansson, Schmidt and Winnik accounted for 28.1 Point Shares.\n\nAlthough past Point Shares are not an exact indicator of how a team will perform, it can underscore the Capitals\u2019 roster deficiencies entering the season.\nFor the past three seasons the Capitals have been in win-now mode, acquiring high-end talent, while players like Evgeny Kuznetsov and Dmitry Orlov were signed to inexpensive contracts, to help Washington win their first Stanley Cup.\nBut after the Capitals were eliminated by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round of the playoffs for a second consecutive year, general manager Brian MacLellan\u2019s self-imposed championship window expired. They entered the summer with nine regular players needing new contracts and not nearly enough money to go around.\nIn July, MacLellan likened the Capitals\u2019 significant roster turnover to a Stanley Cup-winning team maneuvering around the salary cap post-championship parade. It was an apt comparison, minus the championship part.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last three years building that team to where it was last year, and we maxed it out, both player-wise and salary-wise,\u201d MacLellan said. \u201cAnd I think we were expecting to run into some issues here going forward. I think it\u2019s no different than the teams that have won in the past. We have the same kind of hangover, but we haven\u2019t won a championship and we\u2019re dealing with it now.\u201d\nLike the Capitals this year, the Chicago Blackhawks could not afford to retain important personnel after Stanley Cup wins in 2010 and 2015, resulting in major roster retooling.\nBut unlike the Blackhawks, the Capitals did not have the cap space to replace their departed players with established NHLers. T.J. Oshie and the team\u2019s youngest talent were due significant pay raises, preventing other moves.\nAs a result, the Capitals\u2019 only summer acquisition was Devante Smith-Pelly, who had a -0.3 Point Share last season, with prospects expected to fill out the rest of the roster.\nThe Blackhawks maximized their resources en route to their first Stanley Cup in 47 seasons in 2010, and proceeded to gut the roster to stay under the salary cap. Chicago cut ties with 10 players that summer, including future all-star Dustin Byfuglien, losing 32.2 Point Shares.\nBlackhawks general manager Stan Bowman\u2019s offseason acquisitions had 18.7 Point Shares in the previous season, with newly-signed backup goalie Marty Turco credited with nearly half of them, but Chicago still suffered a net loss of 13.5 Point Shares. That led to a 15-point decline in the standings, as the team dropped from 112 points in 2010 to 97 in 2011.\nAfter their third championship in six years in 2015, the Blackhawks underwent more roster changes. Eight players \u2014 accounting for 24.6 Point Shares \u2014 left Chicago, but the Blackhawks were able to recoup 13.5 Point Shares through offseason acquisitions. (They gained an additional 7 Point Shares with mid-season acquisitions).\nAs a result, the Blackhawks suffered a net loss of 4.1 Point Shares, but still finished 2016 a point better than they did in 2015. The Blackhawks were able to exceed expectations set by Point Shares with the free-agent signing of Artemi Panarin, who went on to register 9.8 Point Shares that season and win the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year.\nIf the Capitals hope to maintain their typical level of regular season excellence, as the 2016 Blackhawks did, they will need to replace the 28.1 Point Shares they lost in the offseason. But with little NHL-level experience being brought in to recover their loss, the Capitals could take a significant stumble down the standings in 2017-2018.",

    "summary": "Many NFL teams are signing average quarterbacks to high-salary contracts despite their performance not matching that of top-tier players like Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers. This trend continues with recent contracts for Matthew Stafford and Derek Carr, who have been paid at elite levels despite inconsistent or mediocre performance metrics over the past few seasons.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland\u2013In today\u2019s passing-heavy NFL, many front offices are signing their quarterbacks to lucrative deals.\nBut many of these players are earning elite salaries despite not ranking among the best at their position, while many top quarterbacks earn lesser salaries, a Capital News Service analysis found.\nWashington\u2019s Kirk Cousins and Baltimore\u2019s Joe Flacco are among the highest paid quarterbacks in the NFL, but they do not produce at the same level that top passers, such as Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers, do.\nIn fact, of the ten highest paid quarterbacks, only four of them \u2014 Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers), Drew Brees (New Orleans Saints), Russell Wilson (Seattle Seahawks) and Ben Roethlisberger (Pittsburgh Steelers) \u2014 have an average QBR (Total Quarterback Rating) above 68 in the last four seasons. Two, Flacco and Derek Carr (Oakland Raiders), failed to break 60.\n\nThe trend of overpaying mediocre quarterbacks shows no sign of slowing down, either.\nOn August 28, the Detroit Lions and Matthew Stafford agreed to a five-year, $135 million contract extension, according to multiple media reports, worth an average of $27 million per year, making the 29-year old quarterback the highest paid player in the NFL. This comes on the heels of Carr\u2019s contract $25 million per year contract extension, which set a record when he signed it in June.\nStafford posted a 70.5 QBR last season, good for eighth in the NFL but well behind Matt Ryan\u2019s league-best 83.3 mark. He owns a 58.9 QBR over the last four seasons, and is 0-3 in playoff games.\nLike Stafford, Cousins and Flacco are among the highest-paid quarterbacks in the league, each making over $22 million a year. Cousins is coming off a strong 2017 in which he threw for nearly 5,000 yards and 25 touchdowns, while ranking in the top third of the league with a 71.7 QBR. He and the Washington front office are at an impasse over contract talks, so he is playing this season under a second consecutive franchise tag worth $23.9 million in hopes of an even more lucrative contract next year.\nLast seasons, Flacco eclipsed 4,000 passing yards for the first time in his nine-year career, but struggled otherwise. He threw nearly as many interceptions as he did touchdowns, and his 58.4 QBR ranked in the bottom half of the league. Nevertheless, he makes $22.1 million per year, sixth most in the NFL.\nMeanwhile, some of the best passers in the league don\u2019t get paid elite salaries. Matt Ryan (Atlanta Falcons) and Tom Brady (New England Patriots), who faced off in the Super Bowl in February, ranked first and second, respectively, in QBR last season. However, neither of them crack the top ten in salary, instead sitting 14th and 15th, respectively, squarely in the middle of the pack.\nWhat accounts for this? Are Flacco and Stafford really worth more than Brady and Rodgers?\nSome of it can be chalked up to timing. Flacco signed a six-year, $120 million extension with the Ravens in March 2013, just one month after winning a Super Bowl. Carr\u2019s extension came after he led the Raiders to their first winning season and playoff berth since 2002. Despite not posting earth-shattering numbers, these quarterbacks conveniently signed contract extensions after their best performances of their career.\nSome teams pay high prices for a quarterback, knowing that the alternative is bleak.\nThe year before drafting Stafford, the Lions went 0-16. While the 2009 first-overall pick hasn\u2019t enjoyed playoff success, his Lions have earned three playoff berths in the last six years after a stretch of ten straight losing seasons prior to that. In Cousins\u2019 first two full years as a starter, he has led Washington to back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since the 1990s.\nQuarterback is a premium position in the NFL. As teams such as the Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers know, finding a dependable passer is easier said than done. While none of the aforementioned passers rank in the upper tier with Brady and Rodgers, teams would still rather break the bank on them than risk returning to their losing ways.",

    "summary": "The Baltimore Orioles' success under Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette is marked by a lineup that hits many home runs but draws few walks, reflecting their belief in aggressive at-bats even without walks. Despite leading in home runs since 2011, the team's low walk rate risks fewer baserunners, often resulting in solo home runs.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Under manager Buck Showalter and general manager Dan Duquette\u2019s watch, the Orioles have formed a successful lineup that hits many home runs and draws few walks.\nWhile this offensive approach helped lead the Orioles to the American League Championship Series in 2014 and American League wild card game in 2016, it was also part of the reason why the team didn\u2019t advance further in those years.\nThe Orioles are only one of many teams who\u2019ve decided to value home runs more, but they are against the grain when it comes to devaluing walks. Baltimore has pursued this approach partially because they trust their players to put together strong at bats even if they don\u2019t end in walks.\n\u201dYou don\u2019t necessarily have to walk to gain something from [the at bat],\u201d Showalter said in a 2016 media session. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a guy make an eight pitch, nine pitch at bat and make an out, but he won that at bat.\u201d\nThe Orioles aggressive approach has helped them hit the most home runs in baseball since 2011. They have the eighth-best winning percentage in that span, and they\u2019ve won with the league\u2019s second-worst walk rate and fifth-worst on-base percentage. By not drawing walks, the Orioles risk not getting as many baserunners as other teams, which results in them hitting more solo home runs than most teams.\nBaltimore has put together a lineup dominated by right-handed power hitters like Manny Machado, Adam Jones and Jonathan Schoop. In 2017, the team has hit a home run once every 22.6 at bats, second-best in baseball. They finished first in that category in 2014 and 2016, when the Orioles made the playoffs, and they finished third in 2015.\nDespite this tremendous power, the Orioles don\u2019t have as much patience. While Baltimore\u2019s aggressive approach leads to home runs, it also means the team walks less than the rest of the league.\nSince Showalter\u2019s first full season, Baltimore has only walked 7.1 percent of the time, second-worst to only Kansas City. When the Orioles made the playoffs in 2014 and 2016, they had a below-average 6.6 and 7.7 walk percentage. In 2017, Baltimore has only walked 6.5 percent of the time, tied for last in baseball.\n\nA big reason for building an aggressive, right-handed heavy lineup is the ballpark in which they play. Since right-handed power bats can take advantage of hitter-friendly Camden Yards, seven of the Orioles\u2019 everyday players are righties who have an aggressive approach, resulting in a high home run and low walk rate.\nDue to this strategy, the Orioles front office decided to let some key players go in free agency. Nick Markakis leaving to sign with Atlanta stands out the most.\nMarkakis, who played nine years with the team, has a career 10.5 walk percentage, but is a lefty who only hits a homer once every 42.7 at bats, and didn\u2019t fit the mold of what plays well at Camden.\nSince leaving Baltimore, Markakis has averaged a 10.3 walk percentage for the Atlanta Braves, surpassing double digits in each of the past three seasons. In all of Markakis\u2019 full seasons playing for Showalter, his highest walk percentage was 8.9. Markakis\u2019 career high walk percentage: 14.2, which he posted in 2008, before Showalter arrived.\nA year later, the Orioles traded for Mark Trumbo, who has walked 6.8 percent of the time and hit a homerun every 18 at bats over his career. After Trumbo hit 47 home runs for Baltimore in 2016, he signed a three-year, $37 million deal with the team, close to Markakis\u2019 four-year, $44 million deal with the Braves.\nThis past offseason, the Orioles signed catcher Welington Castillo, who has a career 6.9 walk percentage and hits a homerun every 25.7 at bats. Castillo replaced Matt Wieters, who walks 8.1 percent of the time and hits a home run in every 27.8 at bats. Wieters and Markakis spent a combined 18 years in an Oriole uniform.\nJake Mintz has been following the Orioles closely in the Showalter era. Half of the popular Twitter account Cespedes Family BBQ, and most recently a Cut4 personality, Mintz says the team seems to be willing to live and die by the same player type.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going out and trying to develop hitters in that way, but it seems that the guys that they bring in kind of fit that mold,\u201d Mintz said. \u201cIt seems like they\u2019re doubling down on that type of player.\u201d\nOne of the more recent Orioles success stories is Tim Beckham, whom the Orioles received from the Rays at the trade deadline this year. With the Orioles, he is hitting more home runs and walking less. And despite the lack of patience, Beckham\u2019s OPS (On-Base Plus Slugging percentage) with Baltimore is .270 points higher than it was with Tampa Bay.\n\nAlthough the Orioles have committed to this strategy, they\u2019ve still deviated from it \u2014 if an incoming player is talented enough.\nThe biggest example: Chris Davis, a cornerstone of the team since he arrived in 2011. Despite hitting a home run in every 15.4 at bats for his career, Davis also walks 10 percent of the time. When the team signed Davis to a 7-year, $161 million contract in 2016, they were looking at Davis\u2019 power output and less at his walk rate.\nEven when Davis doesn\u2019t walk, he takes notes from each plate appearance, something that his manager appreciates.\n\u201dI remember Chris, one time during the spring, had like an eight or nine pitch at bat,\u201d Showalter said. \u201cIn the dugout he was talking to me about \u201cI saw everything he has to offer in one at bat.\u2019\u201d",

    "summary": "Anthony Rendon, despite his elite-level play contributing to the Washington Nationals' second-best record in the National League, lacks significant MVP buzz and betting odds favoring him. However, his all-around excellence, reflected in leading WAR statistics, suggests he deserves more consideration in the MVP race.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland\u2013The Washington Nationals have the National League\u2019s second-best record. One of the main reasons: the elite-level play of third baseman Anthony Rendon.\nBut Rendon did not make the All-Star Team and, according to pundits and oddsmakers, does not have much chance of taking home the league\u2019s MVP award.\nSports betting website Bovada.com gives Rendon 20-1 odds to win the award \u2014 seventh-best in the league \u2014 compared to 3-2 odds for current favorite Giancarlo Stanton of the Miami Marlins.\nThe crowded league MVP race field also includes a handful of other Nationals\u2019 players. It feels like Rendon is \u201ccompeting against his own team to see who\u2019s really the most valuable player there,\u201d said MLB.com Nationals beat writer Jamal Collier.\n\u201cIn a race like this for the MVP, he\u2019s just a guy who a lot of people might not consider right away, until you really take a dive into his numbers and see how good he\u2019s been,\u201d Collier said. \u201cBut he definitely deserves to be in those first couple of names mentioned.\u201d\nHere are the top four reasons Rendon deserves to be in the MVP running.\n1. He\u2019s an all-around player\nRendon\u2019s statistical case for the award mostly rests on his all-around excellence. He\u2019s far above average at the plate, in the field and on the bases, pushing his total value higher than almost anyone else. While there are players better than Rendon at each of those three aspects of the game, very few have matched his performance in all three.\nWins Above Replacement (WAR) is an all-encompassing stat that measures how \u201cvaluable\u201d a player has been compared with a \u201creplacement player\u201d called up from the minor leagues.\nA leading baseball website, Fangraphs.com, has Rendon tied with the Houston Astros\u2019 Jose Altuve for the MLB position-player WAR lead at 6.5 wins. Odds-on MVP favorite Stanton comes in third at 6.1. Other WAR formulas find slightly different numbers, but most agree Rendon has been of the most valuable players in the league.\n\nRendon\u2019s all-around play this season should put him in the conversation for the MVP, said Andrew DiComo, a New York Mets beat writer for MLB.com.\n\u201cHe brings a lot of value, and I think he gets overshadowed by Bryce Harper and Daniel Murphy,\u201d DiComo said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really, off the top of my head, have a weakness, and that\u2019s a pretty rare thing, especially in today\u2019s game when guys can be so specialized.\u201d\n2. He\u2019s a defensive stalwart\nOne factor that differentiates Rendon from most other league MVP candidates: a large part of his value lies in his defensive ability.\n\nHe plays an excellent hot corner, ranking among the league leaders in defensive metrics such as Ultimate Zone Rating (UZR). UZR assigns each play a run value and credits or penalizes a player depending on whether he made the play.\n\u201cDefensively he is as good as anybody else at that position,\u201d Collier said. \u201cWith Rendon, the impact he makes on the field, kind of how easily he picks it, watching it every day you get to really appreciate just how smooth he is defensively.\u201d\n\n3. He can hit, too\nRendon is not an elite power hitter like most of the other players in the MVP race, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from contributing as a hitter. Although not in the same rarefied air with the bat as he is on defense, he is still among the league\u2019s best hitters by several measures.\nHis on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) comes in at a stellar .948, a figure that ranks eighth in the league and 42 percent better than league average. That\u2019s ahead of Colorado Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado \u2014 a dark horse MVP candidate \u2014 although significantly behind Stanton. Using more traditional offensive stats, Rendon\u2019s 90 RBI are 10th in the league, ahead of slugging teammate Murphy.\n\nStill, a lack of power relative to his fellow MVP-chasers might hinder Rendon\u2019s candidacy in the end.\n\u201cHome runs is a sexy stat that people look at,\u201d DiComo said. \u201cWhat Giancarlo Stanton is doing right now [an MLB-best 53 home runs] for example has opened eyes. If you hit a lot of home runs, you\u2019re generally going to be in contention for postseason awards.\u201d\nRendon has hit 23 home runs this season, a personal career high. However, it still pales in comparison to Stanton and Arenado, who both have at least 30 homers.\n4. He\u2019s been consistent down the stretch\nThe MVP debate could change radically over the final weeks of the season. If Stanton leads the Marlins to an improbable playoff berth, or another candidate goes on a home-run binge, the narrative around the race is bound to shift.\nHenry Schulman, a Giants writer for the San Francisco Chronicle, has been part of the league MVP electorate each year since at least 2012. He places extra value on late-season performance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even start looking at numbers and such until the final week of the regular season because I am a big believer that September performance is important in the discussion,\u201d said Schulman via email. \u201cI couldn\u2019t begin to tell you where I see Rendon fitting in.\u201d\nRendon\u2019s performance in recent weeks has done nothing to hurt his chances. Since Aug. 15, his OPS is a healthy .915 and his batting average is .333, significantly higher than his season mark of .304. In 20 games since mid-August, Rendon has knocked in 14 runs and collected 10 extra-base hits.\nDespite the possibility that a good September could put him in the conversation for the league\u2019s highest honor, Collier believes Rendon isn\u2019t focused on it.\n\u201cA lot of people will say when they\u2019re asked about it, \u2018Yeah I\u2019m not thinking about that I\u2019m focused on the team,\u2019\u201d Collier said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s not just lip service or BS when he says it because he generally shows up and plays the game and is kind of focused on baseball.\u201d",

Here are four players from each squad, along with their average draft position in ESPN fantasy leagues (as of Friday morning), what roles they should occupy on your fantasy team and why you should consider them.\n\u00a0\n1. Terrelle Pryor (WR, Washington)\nTerrelle Pryor appears in a game for the Cleveland Browns in 2016.

He eclipsed 1000 receiving yards* for a bad offense in 2016 and, through free agency, he joined Washington just as the team lost both DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon.

Jordan Reed (TE, Washington)\nJordan Reed shouts during a game against the Green Bay Packers in 2016. Keith Allison/Flickr\nAverage draft position: 45.4\nTarget as your: TE1\nWhy: Reed missed four games last year due to multiple injuries, but when he\u2019s on the field, he\u2019s one of the best tight ends in the business. In 2015, he had the second-most receptions among NFL tight ends (in just 14 games, no less). Over the last two seasons he caught 75.4 percent of passes thrown his way. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a better tight end after Rob Gronkowski is off the board.\n\u00a0\n3. Jamison Crowder (WR, Washington)\nJamison Crowder plays in a 2016 game against the Green Bay Packers. Keith Allison/Flickr\nAverage draft position: 65.2\nTarget as your: Flex/WR3\nWhy: Whenever opponents blanket Pryor and Reed in coverage this year, the 5-foot-9 Crowder should wiggle his way open. He had 67 catches and 99 targets last year while surrounded by Garcon, Jackson and Reed. He led the team with seven touchdown receptions, too. Washington throws the ball enough to keep giving Crowder a relatively high volume of targets. If he\u2019s on the board in the sixth round, consider him as a flex option.\n\u00a0\n4. Danny Woodhead (RB, Baltimore)\nDanny Woodhead carries the ball in a 2011 practice with the New England Patriots. Beth Hart/Flickr\nAverage draft position: 65.8\nTarget as your: Flex/bench option\nWhy: Woodhead\u2019s average draft position places him in the seventh round for 10-team leagues, but only target him that high if you play in a PPR (points per reception) league. Woodhead is expected to split carries with two other running backs, and last year the Ravens posted the NFL\u2019s third-fewest rushing attempts as a team (367). But in the last four seasons he played for the Chargers, Woodhead averaged 4.5 receptions a game and scored more touchdowns receiving (13) than rushing (five).\n\u00a0\n5. Kirk Cousins (QB, Washington)\nKirk Cousins plays in a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2014. Keith Allison/Flickr\nAverage draft position: 79.6\nTarget as your: QB1\nWhy: By now you\u2019ve read about the various receiving targets Washington has. Well, one guy is throwing to all of them. Cousins may be a polarizing figure, but ESPN analysts see him as the sixth-best fantasy quarterback this year. He approached the 5,000-yard mark in his fifth NFL season, finishing third in the league with 4,917. Another reason to be high on Cousins (at least statistically): His running back stable of Rob Kelley, Samaje Perine and Chris Thompson is among the least impressive in the league.\n\u00a0\n6. Mike Wallace (WR, Baltimore)\nMike Wallace (right) and Ryan Tannehill celebrate during a game the Miami Dolphins played in London in 2014. Airman 1st Class Trevor T. McBride/U.S. Air Force\nAverage draft position: 102.6\nTarget as your: Flex/bench option\nWhy: Wallace was targeted 116 times last year, and it\u2019s not ridiculous to think that number could go way up. The Ravens no longer have tight end Dennis Pitta (waived after injury) or wide receivers Steve Smith Sr. (retired) and Kamar Aiken (left in free agency). Even with Jeremy Maclin joining the receiving corps, Wallace stands out as great value late in your draft.\n\u00a0\n7. Justin Tucker (K, Baltimore)\nJustin Tucker warms up before a game in 2015. Keith Allison/Flickr\nAverage draft position: 105.2\nTarget as your: Final draft pick\nWhy: Tucker\u2019s average draft position means people are selecting him long before the final round of their draft. You should never reach for a placekicker like that, but if Tucker is available for your last pick, he\u2019s a great option. No kicker in NFL history has a better career field goal conversion rate than Tucker (89.8 percent). And last year he reached double-digit fantasy points in nine of 16 games for the Ravens.\n\u00a0\n8. Joe Flacco (QB, Baltimore)\nJoe Flacco practices at Baltimore Ravens training camp in 2009. Keith Allison/Flickr\nAverage draft position: 133.2\nTarget as your: QB2\nWhy: Flacco is not an elite quarterback, but he\u2019s a good backup in a pinch. An injury he sustained in training camp raised questions about his availability for opening weekend, according to RotoWire, which has lowered his draft stock. However, no quarterback dropped back to pass more often than Flacco in 2016 (672 pass attempts and 33 sacks, just higher than Drew Brees\u2019 673 attempts and 27 sacks). That amount of passing opportunities can translate into more opportunities for fantasy points.\n\u00a0\n*All statistics come from pro-football-reference.com.",

    "content": "By ADAM ZIELONKA, DYLAN SINN, DANIEL CHAVKIN, LINDSEY FEINGOLD and MOLLIE HIGGINS\nThis story was reported by Adam Zielonka, Dylan Sinn, Daniel Chavkin, Lindsey Feingold and Mollie Higgins and was written by Adam Zielonka.\nCOLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Roger Federer will go down as perhaps the greatest tennis player in history. But during a five-set match in Flushing Meadows on Tuesday night, an unseeded 19-year-old from Maryland put up the kind of challenge Federer rarely faces in the early rounds of a Grand Slam event.\nFrances Tiafoe, the 70th-ranked tennis player in the world, won two sets against Federer in the opening round of the U.S. Open. Federer eventually beat Tiafoe, a native of Riverdale, Maryland, in five sets (4-6, 6-2, 6-1, 1-6, 6-4) but Tiafoe became the fourth player to take Federer to five sets \u2014 or defeat him \u2014 in the first two rounds of a Grand Slam since his first Grand Slam victory at Wimbledon in 2003, a Capital News Service analysis found.\n\nFederer, 36, won the 2017 Australian Open and Wimbledon, but his close call against Tiafoe came as he has dealt with knee and back injuries that caused him to miss three of the last six Grand Slams. According to ESPN, Federer said after the match he \u201calways knew (he) was going to come in feeling rusty or not great,\u201d but he also credited Tiafoe\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cGreat year so far. You\u2019re only getting better. Keep going, you\u2019re going to have one hell of a future.\u201d@rogerfederer to @FTiafoe #usopen pic.twitter.com/U0YOWjzJ8F\n\u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) August 30, 2017\n\nIn an essay he wrote in The Players\u2019 Tribune this week, Tiafoe said he first faced Federer, a 19-time Grand Slam singles champion, in the 2017 Miami Open and lost to him in straight sets. Nevertheless, Tiafoe\u2019s star has been rising. He had a decorated junior career and trained at the Junior Tennis Champions Center (JTCC) in College Park.\nRay Benton, the tennis center\u2019s CEO since 2008, has known the Tiafoe family for 15 years. Tiafoe\u2019s father, an immigrant from Sierra Leone, worked on building the academy and then became their head of maintenance, Benton said.\n\u201cFor the last five years, I\u2019ve thought that (Frances) would get to be one of the top 10 or 20 players in the world,\u201d Benton said. \u201cBut to see him at 19 playing Federer on center court on a Tuesday night match was almost surreal. It was such a big deal.\u201d\n\nCollege Park local @FTiafoe plays @rogerfederer tonight in the opening round of the @usopen! #goodluck Frances @TheJTCC (photo: art seitz) pic.twitter.com/U6NUhj6qnN\n\u2014 City of College Park (@CollegePark_MD) August 29, 2017\n\n\nA kid who started playing tennis at center where his dad was maintenance guy has Federer in a 5th in Ashe night match. I love tennis #USOpen\n\u2014 Nick McCarvel (@NickMcCarvel) August 30, 2017\n\nFederer\u2019s history of dominance in Grand Slams proves that Tiafoe\u2019s showing was, in fact, a big deal.\nFrom 1999 to 2003, Federer was still gaining his footing as a young phenom in the sport. He was shown the door in the first two rounds of a Grand Slam five times during that span and took five sets to win matches on three occasions.\nOnce he scored his first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon in 2003, the Swiss man grew to be one of the sport\u2019s most dominant forces, particularly in the U.S. Open. Federer won 66 straight first- and second-round U.S. Open sets between 2005 and 2015. His first-set loss to Tiafoe was the first time Federer dropped an early-round set since a 2004 second-round match against Marcos Baghdatis from Cyprus (a set Federer lost 7-6).\n\nSince then, early-round upsets and upset scares have been rare for Federer. He needed five sets to defeat Alejandro Falla of Colombia in the first round at Wimbledon in 2010, and again at the 2011 Australian Open against Frenchman Gilles Simon. Federer\u2019s only first- or second-round defeat in a Grand Slam since then came against Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships, an unusual year where nine of the top 20 men and women lost in the first three days.\nAt 19, Tiafoe is far and away the youngest player to push Federer to five sets in an early Grand Slam round since 2003, the CNS analysis found.\nThe year 2003 in tennis stands out for another reason: It was the last time an American male player won a Grand Slam event. American fans might find hope in Tiafoe after he put up such a fight against Federer. As far as the future of American tennis, Benton says there are many male players on their way up.\n\u201cFrances is lucky because he has a group of American players his age who are all coming up, and so they\u2019re all pushing each other,\u201d Benton said, while noting that Tiafoe \u201cmay be the preeminent one.\u201d\nA rare early-round challenge to an all-time great certainly lends credence to that opinion.\n\nWhat fight from the Maryland native. Tiafoe leaves with plenty of new fans and won\u2019t be satisfied w simply going the distance w Fed #USOpen\n\u2014 Kelyn Soong (@KelynSoong) August 30, 2017",

    "summary": "Building a World Series-winning MLB team is largely about creating a roster that scores more runs than it allows, as run differential has been the strongest predictor of success over the past decade. However, even with the best run differential, playoff success is not guaranteed due to the volatility of short series and performance variability.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Based on the conversations we have with one another about our favorite MLB clubs, we all think we would be a great general manager capable of building the perfect, title-winning baseball team. We\u2019re all wrong, at least some of the time, because even the \u201cbest\u201d team often does not win the championship. Knowing that, how is anyone supposed to build a roster to win the World Series?\nMost of the time you won\u2019t. You will fail a whole lot. The best you can do is follow these principles, often positively associated with winners over the last 10 years, and hope to get lucky.\n1. Q: What\u2019s the most important predictor of success? \nA: Score more than the other team\nLet\u2019s get an obvious point out of the way. The objective of is to score more than the other team. It doesn\u2019t matter if your team scores 10 times if it gives up 11 runs, and your pitcher\u2019s one-run complete game doesn\u2019t help if his offense gets shut out.\nYou need to have some combination of hitting and pitching talent that allows you to come away with a positive run differential.\nRun differential was the single most predictive measure of success between 2007 and 2016, with a nearly perfect correlation of 0.95 to regular season win total that period. A correlation of 1.0 indicates a perfect relationship between two variables.\n\nLooking at each season by all 30 teams over 10 years, there is a correlation of 0.92 between run differential and regular season wins.\n\nA great regular season run differential does not guarantee playoff success, especially if a team goes cold in October. Over the last 10 years, there correlation between regular season run differential and postseason win total is smaller but still strong, 0.64.\nThe trend is obvious: the more runs a team scores than the opposition, the better the team\u2019s record.\nThat\u2019s how it averages out over time anyway. Crazy things can happen in a single year. The Texas Rangers secured home-field advantage last year with a 95-67 record, best in the American League. Their run differential was a meager +8, worst among all playoff teams. It also trailed the differential of four teams that missed the postseason.\nWith that differential, they would be expected to finish 82-80, according to Pythagorean Win-Loss, which Bill James developed to predict winning percentage based on runs scored and allowed. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the Rangers\u2019 true talent level, Texas lost all three games in its lone playoff series.\n2. Q: How should I try to beef up my run differential?\n A: Look to your position players to guide you\nGood hitting and pitching are necessary to record a positive run differential. But when deciding which one to spend on, it\u2019s important to remember that position players have had a greater influence on winning this decade.\nWins above replacement (WAR) judges a player\u2019s total contribution to the team based on the number of wins a player is worth compared to a minor-league call-up player. It measures a player\u2019s hitting, fielding, baserunning and pitching ability and makes comparisons to league and positional averages to find out how many wins a player is worth to his team.\nWorld Series winners and average teams receive a greater WAR contribution from their position players than pitchers. But while the difference between the regular season pitching by eventual title teams and the average squad is less than two wins above replacement (about 12 percent), the gap separating position players is huge.\nPosition players on championship teams are worth nearly 30 wins above replacement on average. An average group generates 19 WAR. That\u2019s a difference of 57 percent.\nWAR is a catch-all stat and it can be dangerous to use an all-inclusive number to judge talent. But the correlation between position player WAR and regular season win totals is 0.86 \u2014 and 0.64 for postseason win totals. WAR for pitchers has a correlation of 0.62 for regular season win totals. As far as all-inclusive stats go, WAR is pretty darn reliable, especially for position players.\n\n3. Q: Now that I\u2019ve chosen to build around position players, what kind of hitters should I employ?\n A: Hitters should control the strike zone\nIf you\u2019re still evaluating players based on the stats on the back of their baseball cards, you\u2019re falling behind in the MLB information race. But if you\u2019ve already bought the cards, the stat on the back you should be valuing most is on-base percentage.\nTeam on-base percentage has a 0.72 correlation to regular season wins and 0.54 to postseason win totals. This may come as a surprise, but walks were a better predictor of success than hits, extra base hits and home runs over the full 10 years. They were about equally important as extra base knocks and home runs on a yearly basis. Walks aren\u2019t flashy, but they put a man on first and help the team\u2019s chances of scoring a run at no cost.\n\nDrawing a walk requires a good sense of the strike zone. Hitters have to lay off pitches off the plate they likely can\u2019t touch. Some batters can\u2019t resist the urge to swing and can be manipulated into chasing pitches and striking out. Offensively, you want that to happen as little as possible.\nNothing positive comes with a strikeout. As long as the catcher keeps the ball in front of him, the batter heads back to the dugout and baserunners stay put. Teams that whiff a high percentage of the time find little success, as there is a -0.55 correlation between strikeout percentage and winning (as more batters strike out, wins fall).\nMaking contact with the pitch is the best way to avoid striking out. The 2015 Kansas City Royals have the highest contact percentage (81.9) and contact percentage on pitches in the zone (89.9) of the last five World Series winners. The pesky nature of their hitters helped make up for the team being fairly pedestrian in a number of offensive categories.\n4. Q: Is that all I need from my hitters? A knowledge of the strike zone and an ability to make contact?\n A: The offense should offer some power\nPower isn\u2019t the solution for every MLB team, but it\u2019s often a key component of the best teams to win the World Series. The average team hit 161 home runs per season this decade. The teams that won the title hit 170\u2014not a huge difference.\nBut among the World Series winners, more home runs led to more regular season wins, with a 0.59 correlation. That doubles the correlation between the two stats for the average team, meaning the juggernauts among the World Series winners were crushing the ball over the fence while the less successful title teams got by in other areas.\n\nThe two best teams of the last 12 years\u2014the 2016 Chicago Cubs and 2009 New York Yankees\u2014both won 103 games while slugging 199 and 244 home runs, respectively.\nIt\u2019s also hard to miss that the 2012 Giants managed just 103 home runs, 58 below league average and equivalent to 0.64 per game. But once the playoffs came along, they hit 14 round-trippers in 16 contests (0.875 per game).\nTeams that win the World Series usually spend the postseason out-homering the opposition. Title-winners hit nine percent more homers per game in the playoffs than the average postseason team. That doesn\u2019t sound like much, but in the low-scoring October environment, it can be a difference-maker.\n5. Q: If I can\u2019t find players to hit the ball over the fence, can I win making speed my priority?\n A: Stolen base totals are not that important\nThe average team steals 95.5 bases a year. The number of wins associated with steals fluctuates greatly, making stolen base totals a downright unreliable indicator of success. Over the last decade, there has been a -0.07 correlation between stolen bases and wins, meaning there\u2019s little connection between the number of bags a team swipes and win total.\nWhat does that look like in practice?\n\nSome teams had a collection of gifted base stealers; the Philadelphia Phillies stole 136 in 2008 and the Boston Red Sox took 123 in 2013, for instance. However, three particularly slow-footed teams stole fewer than 60 bases in their regular seasons, which roughly translates to one stolen base every three games.\nFor further comparison, MIlwaukee Brewers infielder Jonathan Villar led the majors in 2016 with 62 steals.\nThe 2014 and 2010 San Francisco Giants and 2011 St. Louis Cardinals continued their glacial stolen base paces in the playoffs, maintaining their sub-0.4 stolen base per game rate. The 2015 Royals lead the decade\u2019s World Series winners with 14 stolen bases in 16 contests, 0.875 per game.\nAs a whole, sabermetrics suggest stolen bases are only helpful if teams can steal successfully at least 75 percent of the time. MLB teams from 2007 to 2016 stole safely 72.6 percent of the time and six of the 10 World Series winners eclipsed 75 percent. The 2013 Red Sox are the gold standard at 86.6 percent on 142 attempts.\n6. Q: Okay, so forget about base stealing. What if I trade some offensive ability for great defense?\n A: You can (and probably should) sacrifice defense to bolster the offense\nDefense has always been the most difficult aspect of baseball to track and evaluate. The sport is better at judging a catcher\u2019s ability to steal strikes with his pitch-framing than it is at understanding who its best defensive players are (former Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter has five Gold Gloves despite his limited fielding range, for instance).\nSo it should come as little surprise that the defensive analytics are not nearly as predictive of success as offensive and pitching statistics. Defensive Runs Saved and Ultimate Zone Rating, which assign run values to judge a player\u2019s defense against the average, are the most reliable. Their correlations to regular season and playoff winning hover around 0.40.\n\nFollow sports long enough and you\u2019ll surely run into the \u201cdefense wins championships\u201d adage. That phrase is not set in stone when it comes to baseball. Four of the last 10 World Series winners were below average in regular season Defensive Runs Saved, with negative marks indicating the defenses hurt the team more than they helped.\nAlthough the numbers have not yet reflected a direct link between good fielding and winning, the 2016 Cubs served as an example of what help a strong defense can be. The Cubs saved the second-most defensive runs of the decade (82), trailing only the 2013 Royals (95).\nOn a related note, Chicago had the fourth-lowest ERA of the last 10 years (3.15). Fielding independent pitching, which is like ERA but takes a pitcher\u2019s supporting fielders out of the equation, suggests Chicago\u2019s staff had the talent worthy of a 3.77 ERA. No team had a better difference between ERA and FIP over the last decade than the 2016 Cubs.\n\nPaired with their outstanding offense, the Cubs recorded an astronomical run differential of +252. That was the most since the Seattle Mariners outscored opponents by 300 runs in 2001. That Seattle squad tied the all-time record by winning 116 games.\nIf you don\u2019t buy into defensive sabermetrics, the simplest of defensive stats gets the point across. Errors do not matter as long as they don\u2019t create unearned runs. There\u2019s a -0.30 correlation between errors and regular season wins, and a near-zero correlation between errors and World Series titles. Meanwhile, unearned runs have a -0.40 correlation with regular season wins and a -0.49 correlation with World Series titles.\nTranslation: Even playoff teams make mistakes in the field. The best ones make sure they don\u2019t happen when runners on base could score.\n7. Q: Speaking of preventing runs, how do I best manage my pitchers?\n A: Keep your starting pitchers in the game as long as you can in the regular season\nWe were bound to run into this debate after the Cleveland Indians bullpen tore up the postseason and propelled them to within a game of winning the World Series. But the truth remains that relievers should be used sparingly in the regular season.\nInnings pitched per game by starters has a correlation of 0.48 with regular season wins, while daily reliever innings is correlated -0.45 with wins. Relievers get burned out when they are overused and they start giving up more runs.\nRelievers are extremely important in the postseason. The ability by the bullpen to strand base runners on base without scoring is better correlated with World Series titles (0.46) than regular season wins (0.40).\nThe closer holds even more influence on the playoffs. Ex-Yankees closer Mariano Rivera holds the all-time regular season saves record, but he earned his aura of invincibility in the playoffs, where he saved 42 games and had a 0.70 ERA.\nNot many possess Rivera\u2019s ability to finish off postseason wins; save percentage is one of the biggest statistical gaps between the team winning the World Series and an average playoff squad. Championship teams convert their save chances 83 percent more often.\n\n8. Q: I picked up a reliable closer. What do I need to build a lead for him to save in a playoff game?\n A: It\u2019s really difficult to hit in the playoffs\nIt\u2019s extremely hard for batters to find success at any time of the year, given how hard it is to connect with a fastball running in at 95+ mph. The degree of difficulty only increases in October, when temperature drops shorten the distance of batted balls and the sport\u2019s best arms are always on the mound.\nBased on postseason run prevention and batting average allowed, playing the team that goes on to win the championship is roughly equivalent to taking an at-bat against Red Sox righty Rick Porcello every time up at the plate. Porcello won the 2016 AL Cy Young.\n\nFacing any random playoff team is akin to stepping in to face Giants lefty Matt Moore. Moore has never put a season quite as good as Porcello\u2019s 2016 together, but he is capable of having amazing games. He came within an out of no-hitting the Los Angeles Dodgers last August and tormented the Cubs for eight innings of one-run ball in Game 4 last October before Chicago stormed back in the ninth to win the series.\n\nEven against pitchers averaging the stats put up by Moore, postseason teams really struggle to find hits. A normal playoff offense is about as productive as the 2011 Mariners, who finished last in the AL in most offensive categories and at one point lost 17 games in a row.\n\nFor comparison\u2019s sake, the average bats of the World Series winner are on par with last year\u2019s Pittsburgh Pirates, a fairly ordinary offensive team.\n\nOffense dries up in the playoffs and baserunners are hard to come by. Driving in runs often requires a big, timely extra-base hit. The World Series-winning team gets 22 percent more extra-base hits (3.0 to 2.4) and 39 percent more RBIs (4.6 to 3.3) per playoff game. Those differences go a long way toward winning in October.\n9. Q: With all those roster areas to pay attention to, how expensive is this team going to be?\n A: Building a good team will likely cost a chunk of money\nBaseball is the only one of the top four North American sports that doesn\u2019t use a salary cap. Teams have more statistical information now than they used to and top-market teams like the Yankees can\u2019t run away with the league by outspending everyone anymore. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work, in theory.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2016, eight of the 10 teams that spent the most were above .500. Six of the 10 clubs that spent the fewest finished below .500. The free-spending Dodgers and Yankees, the league\u2019s top-two check writers, had the third- and fourth-most wins in baseball.\nOver those six seasons, there was a correlation of 0.547 between total money spent and regular season win totals.\nSome teams remained competitive despite their small markets and payrolls. The Indians, Pirates, Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays all finished above .500 over the course of those six years despite doling out $520 million or less.\n10. Q: How did those small market teams win? Is there a market inefficiency?\n A: Spending on pitchers helps, but you don\u2019t have to if you draft and develop pitching well.\nPitching offered an interesting spectrum of results. The Dodgers and Giants spent the most on their arms. San Francisco won two of its championships after 2011, while Los Angeles won the third-most games in the league. Meanwhile, the Cubs and Phillies paid heavily for pitching and finished below .500. The two teams entered a rebuilding phase that saw them on the hook for big contracts for players they traded to restock the farm system.\n\nAs Chicago and Philadelphia floundered, a handful of small-market clubs flourished. The Pirates, Athletics, Rays, Indians and Atlanta Braves all finished above .500, not a club among them spending more than $200 million on pitching. All five teams leaned heavily on young pitchers on entry-level contracts.\nA team like the Rays cannot afford the salary an ace like lefty David Price would command in free agency. Tampa Bay hung onto Price as long as it could, then traded him in his last summer under contract. That way, the Rays could at least get some prospects in return for Price before he could sign with another team, which would leave Tampa Bay with nothing.\nPrice won the AL Cy Young in 2012 with a $4.35 million tagline and finished second in 2010 while making $1 million, according to Spotrac. Indians ace Corey Kluber won the award in 2014 while earning $514,000.

    "summary": "The excitement of an NBA postseason varies among fans and can be quantified by \"the excitement index,\" which measures the fluctuation in win probability during games; using this metric, the Cleveland-Indiana matchup was predicted to be the most thrilling due to the LeBron James vs. Paul George rivalry.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2013 Whether you are a fan of the NBA or a network executive looking to attract as many viewers to TV screens as possible, your hopes for the postseason are the same: an exciting outcome.\nOf course, the word \u201cexciting\u201d is subjective. To some, an exciting postseason would lead to a rematch between the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers for the third straight year \u2014 and LeBron James\u2019 seventh consecutive finals appearance. To others, an exciting postseason would be filled with upsets galore.\nIn order to create a consistent definition, Mike Beuoy, creator of the sports data visualization blog inpredictable.com, quantified the term by creating \u201cthe excitement index.\u201d\nThe number is derived from win probability graphs, an example of one from Beuoy\u2019s site is shown below.\n\nThe line is a live probability tracker, which measures each team\u2019s chance of winning over the span of a game, accounting for the score and remaining time. The excitement index measures the total distance the line travels as it moves up and down throughout the game. \nWe used the excitement index to attempt to predict which first-round playoff matches would offer the most back-and-forth play.  We started with the Cleveland and Indiana Pacers first-round matchup, examining the average excitement index from the four times those teams played during the regular season.  We used the same method the rest of the teams.\n\n\nThe most exciting matchup \u2014 Cleveland-Indiana \u2014 was a continuation of the LeBron James vs. Paul George rivalry that hasn\u2019t seen the postseason since 2014. In the conventional sense of excitement, there aren\u2019t many surprises here. \nHouston Rockets \u2013 Oklahoma City Thunder was a battle between the two leading MVP candidates. While it was fun to watch Steph Curry cook his way through Portland\u2019s defense, it did not yield a fun back-and-forth battle between the teams.\nIt\u2019s commonly believed that once the playoffs start, the regular season no longer matters. If you want proof, look at how many Presidents\u2019 Trophies (for best regular season record)  the Washington Capitals have (3), and compare that to their number of Stanley Cups (0).\nOur playoff excitement prediction did not hold up too well to reality. The graphic below compares our first-round series prediction (based on the regular season) with the actual average excitement index (based on the postseason so far). \n\n\nFour of the eight first-round series averaged higher excitement indexes than they did in the regular season and some series even experienced some significant index jumps (see L.A. Clippers-Utah Jazz series). These numbers become more impactful when compared to last year\u2019s postseason.\nIn 2016, the first-round excitement predictions were similar to this season\u2019s. Though the range of the indexes may be smaller, the averages of each year\u2019s first-round matchups come out to roughly the same, about 6.08.\n\n\nThe similarities stopped there. Overall, viewers of the NBA playoffs saw a first round that was less exciting than the regular season.\n\n\nOf the eight first-round matchups, only two \u2014 Cleveland-Detroit Pistons and San Antonio Spurs -Memphis Grizzlies \u2014 averaged slightly higher indexes in the playoffs than in the regular season. As a whole, the excitement average dropped from 6.089 in the regular season to 5.364 in the playoffs.\nThe lazy argument: this makes sense because fans already know who is going to make the finals and the players let those storylines get to them and affect their play. Thankfully, this year\u2019s playoffs dispel that point.\nThis season, the playoff excitement index was higher than the regular season excitement index. Yes, it was only a .053 increase (from 6.075 to 6.128), but it\u2019s a .86 increase from the year before. Only one series, Golden State-Portland, had a lower average index than last season\u2019s playoff average. Five series fell into that category in 2016.\nIt\u2019s difficult to point to one explanation. It could be that teams in both conferences got better, particularly in the East where wins were distributed more evenly. Whatever the case, one thing is certain: the playoffs these year are definitely worth the watch.",

    "content": "BALTIMORE \u2013 All eyes focused on the base path at Camden Yards, and nothing stood in HER way. \nShe rounded third, closing in on paydirt before finally crossing home plate as a trail of children followed in her wake while their parents cheered them on.\nAnjuli Morales, 8, is no major leaguer \u2014 but she did get to act like one on Sunday after the Orioles-Red Sox game, thanks to a Kids Run the Bases promotion offered by the Baltimore Orioles.\nThe promotion is offered after every Sunday home game to children 14 and younger.\nKids Run the Bases is one of a host of promotions used by the Baltimore Orioles \u2014 and other major league baseball teams \u2014 to draw in fans. \n\nAnjuli\u2019s father, Robert Morales, said that the promotion was not the only reason they came to the game, but the younger Morales was quick to disagree. \n\u201cIt\u2019s fun because you get to actually see and you can tell how it feels to be a baseball player,\u201d she told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service.\nHer father contended they came because it was a game on the list for the Orioles Dugout Club \u2014 a group for young fans. \nMary and Larry Nace, Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, natives, also came because of the Dugout Club, but they did say that Kids Run the Bases had an impact. \nTheir son, Nickolas, 7, who wore a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sweatshirt, had never run the bases and was excited to step onto the diamond.\nNickolas Nace, left, 7, of Shrewsbury, Penn., runs toward home plate at Oriole Park at Camden Yards on April 23, 2017. As part of ticket sales promotions, the Orioles let children younger than 14 run the bases after every Sunday home game. (Hannah Klarner / Capital News Service)\n\u201cIt think (it was successful),\u201d Larry Nace said. \u201cThe line\u2019s enormous.\u201d\n\u201cIt would be nice to see more events like (this),\u201d Mary added.\nP.K. Kannan, a professor of marketing science at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business, said ticket promotions are an example of a commonplace marketing strategy by businesses.\nThe idea behind ticket promotions is that teams must spend money \u2014 an acquisition cost \u2014 in order to draw in fans. This practice gives fans an incentive to enter into a relationship with a team, Kannan said.\nThe goal of the practice is to convert these new attendees into regulars, he added.\nAn example of this practice would be promotion pricing for new customers, offered by companies such as Uber.\n\u201cNot everyone will come back, but maybe a percentage will become regulars,\u201d Kannan said.\nOn the other hand, fans say that promotions are not always the only reason they go to games \u2014 but they do have some impact. \nJenn Buckley and Spencer Cooper \u2014 two fans at the Orioles-Red Sox game \u2014 said that while promotions would not be the only reason they went, if there were multiple games and only one had a promotion they would \u201cabsolutely\u201d go to that one.\nAt the game, Cooper wore Buckley\u2019s Orioles Hawaiian shirt \u2014 a popular promotional item from a few seasons ago. \n\u201c(I) went for the shirt, (but it was) also the O\u2019s-(Nationals) game,\u201d Buckley said.\nThe game was one of two with a promotion during the three-game weekend series in July 2015. Both games with promotions saw nearly 2,000 more people attend than those without. \nOver the past three seasons, weekend games \u2014 meaning Friday, Saturday and Sunday \u2014 with promotions had, on average, between 1,500 and 5,000 more people in attendance than those without.\n\nA 2012 article analyzing attendance for the Pittsburgh Pirates\u2019 2010 season in the Sports Business Journal by Wayne DeSarbo, a marketing professor at Penn State University, found that while promotions are not guaranteed to cause above-average attendance, every game with above-average attendance had a promotion.\nThe promotions that had the highest impact on attendance included those with specific giveaways \u2014 such as a bobblehead \u2014 or games with a concert or fireworks afterward, DeSarbo wrote.\nPromotions are never the only factor in who attends a game. Other factors include weather, team performance and the opponent, DeSarbo said.\nAccording to DeSarbo, a key factor in the need for promotions is the specific team\u2019s success rate. Team\u2019s are likely to need more promotions when they are unlikely to compete for a World Series, he said.\n\u201c(They) get people to attend for other reasons beyond seeing the home team win,\u201d DeSarbo told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service. \nWhen teams are less competitive, it becomes \u201ca matter of family entertainment,\u201d he added. \n\u201cWhere you don\u2019t see the need for such expense is when you have a shot of going all the way,\u201d DeSarbo said. \nTeams also look to diversify the types of promotions they offer. \nCraig Gentry, at home plate, prepares for an at-bat during the Baltimore Orioles home game against the Boston Red Sox on April 23, 2017, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles reported that 35,522 fans attended the game. Some came as part of the ticket promotion Kids Run The Bases, which allows children younger than 14 to run the bases following Sunday home games. (Hannah Klarner / Capital News Service)\n\u201cWhen planning a promotional calendar, we are always looking to appeal to a diverse fan base,\u201d Greg Bader, Orioles vice president for communications and marketing, said in a statement through a team spokeswoman. \u201cSundays are designed to be a \u2018family fun day\u2019 at the ballpark. Kids Run the Bases after every Sunday game and we direct some of our \u2018kids only\u2019 promotions to those games.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen planning a promotional calendar, we are always looking to appeal to a diverse fan base,\u201d Greg Bader, Orioles vice president for communications and marketing, said in a statement through a team spokeswoman. \u201cSundays are designed to be a \u2018family fun day\u2019 at the ballpark.

An analysis suggests that in at least three past seasons, Wall\u2019s current stats would have earned him MVP votes or even the award itself.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 The Washington Wizards just won their division for the first time in nearly 40 years, and the biggest driver of their success has been franchise superstar John Wall.\nThe four-time all star is putting up career highs in points and assists and leading the league in steals. But he\u2019s unlikely to get any votes for MVP because of historic seasons from Russell Westbrook and James Harden, both of whom are posting league-leading stat lines.\n\n\nWestbrook, of the Oklahoma City Thunder, is the first player in 55 years to average a triple-double for the season (30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds, 11.4 assists). And the Houston Rockets\u2019 Harden, under a new coach and in a new position, is somehow leading the league in assists and win shares.\nJohn Wall is playing out of his mind. His problem: he\u2019s doing it in the wrong year. A Capital News Service analysis found he\u2019d have a strong case for getting at least one MVP vote \u2014 and maybe even winning the award \u2014 in at least three of the last 15 seasons.\nWe compared Wall\u2019s 2017 statistical output to guards who received at least a single MVP vote in prior seasons, to see how Wall would have fared. We didn\u2019t compare him to centers or forwards, who tend to have different statistical profiles.\nWe think he would have gotten at least one vote in 2006-2007. He would have been in the running in 2004-2005. And he probably could have won in 2001-2002.\n2006-2007\nIt\u2019s clear that Wall could not have won the MVP this season. Dallas Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki \u2014 perhaps the greatest European player in NBA history \u2014 won on the back of a career year.\nThe player who finished second, Phoenix Suns point guard Steve Nash, did better than Wall in most statistical categories, and had a breakout season with their famous \u201cseven seconds or less\u201d offense, winning 61 games.\nBut 2017 John Wall almost certainly would have received one vote. His stat line in this season compares favorably to Nash in terms of steals and points. And he surpassed Tony Parker, the guard who received the lowest number of MVP votes that season, in all but one category.\n\n\nAnother point in his favor: the point guards who got MVP votes that season averaged 20.5 points, 7.7 assists, 3.8 rebounds and a 22.3 player efficiency rating. Wall beats out all of those numbers.\n2004-2005\nIn this season, Wall has a stronger case for winning the award. Nash, the 2005 MVP, had a down year statistically compared to 2007.\nWall leads Nash and Washington Wizards Gilbert Arenas, the guard with the least MVP votes this season, in every single category, except win shares. The win-share deficit can be explained by the fact that Wall\u2019s 2017 teammates are simply better than Nash\u2019s or Arenas\u2019 were in 2005.\nAnd while Nash anchored the league\u2019s highest scoring offense that year, the 2017 Wizards would have been the second highest-scoring offense in 2005, averaging about one point less per game.\n\n\nExcept for assists, Arenas put up better numbers than Nash. But the 2005 Wizards only won 41 games, compared to 61 for Nash\u2019s Suns. Since 1981, no MVP has come from a team with less than 50 wins. The Wizards won 49 games this year.\nThe win totals makes it difficult to definitively say that Wall would have beaten out Nash for the MVP, but we can assume that he would have had a fighting chance.\n2001-2002\nWe think Wall would have won this year. Point guard Jason Kidd, of the New Jersey (now Brooklyn) Nets, almost beat San Antonio Spurs forward Tim Duncan in the race for MVP, narrowly finishing second. Other than rebounding, Wall beats out Kidd in every statistical category. And the Wizards only finished four games behind the Nets regular season record.\nYes, the New Jersey Nets winning 26 more games than the previous season fueled Kidd\u2019s MVP candidacy. But Kidd ended up with the same number of win shares as Wall while playing more games and more minutes, meaning it took him longer to produce the same number of wins for his team. And he was way better than the guard with the lowest number of votes, Mike Bibby of the Sacramento Kings.\n\n\nThis year\nWhat about this year? Should the fact that Wall brought the franchise to a level it has not seen in decades earn him MVP votes? We say yes.\nThe good news for Wall: the playoffs start Saturday, showcasing the Eastern Conference\u2019s best point guard to a national audience. The bad news for Wall: the votes for MVP have already been cast.",
