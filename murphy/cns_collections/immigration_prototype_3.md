# Immigration Coverage Guide: A Resource for Early-Career Journalists

## Overview

Immigration has become one of the most politically charged and consequential policy areas in American life, directly affecting millions of people across the United States and shaping debates about national identity, security, economics, and human rights. This guide will help you understand the immigration landscape, key issues, and the people most affected by policy changes.

## Understanding the Core Programs and Policies

### DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals)

DACA represents one of the most visible immigration policy battles of recent years. Created in 2012 under President Obama, the program shields young undocumented immigrants—often called "Dreamers"—from deportation and grants them two-year renewable work permits. To be eligible, applicants had to be between 16 and 31 years old as of June 2012, have lived in the United States since 2007, and have no serious criminal record.

The Trump administration announced plans to end DACA in September 2017, creating enormous uncertainty for approximately 800,000 recipients nationwide. In Maryland alone, roughly 9,700 people were enrolled in DACA as of March 2017. The Supreme Court heard arguments in November 2019 about whether the termination was lawful, and in December 2020, a federal judge ordered restoration of the program to its original Obama-era policies.

**Key story angles to explore:**
- How are DACA recipients planning for their futures amid ongoing legal uncertainty? Even with recent court victories, the program's long-term survival remains unclear.
- What happens to recipients whose permits expire during periods when the program isn't accepting renewals? Track individuals caught in bureaucratic limbo.
- How are educational institutions, employers, and military branches preparing for potential loss of DACA workers and students?

### Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

TPS grants temporary legal status to immigrants from countries experiencing armed conflict, environmental disasters, or other extraordinary conditions that make return unsafe. The program has protected approximately 437,000 people from 10 designated countries, including 22,500 in Maryland.

The Trump administration moved to terminate TPS for several countries, including El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and Nepal, though courts have blocked some terminations. Maryland Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen introduced the SECURE Act in November 2017, which would allow TPS holders to apply for legal permanent residency after three years.

**Underreported angles:**
- What happens to TPS holders from countries where conditions haven't improved but designation expired years ago? Many live in extended legal limbo.
- How do families make decisions about children born in the U.S. when parents face deportation? Some are obtaining passports to take U.S.-citizen children with them.
- What is the economic impact on specific Maryland communities that would lose significant portions of their workforce?

### H-2B Visa Program

This seasonal worker program is critical for Maryland's seafood and tourism industries but has faced ongoing challenges. The program caps annual visas at 66,000, split between two six-month periods. Maryland's seafood industry alone requires thousands of these workers for crab-picking and oyster-shucking during peak season.

The Trump administration authorized an additional 35,000 H-2B visas in March 2020 after intense pressure from Maryland's congressional delegation and industry representatives. However, the COVID-19 pandemic created new complications, with workers traveling thousands of miles in crowded buses without required testing or quarantine protocols.

**Critical gaps in coverage:**
- The Howard Center investigation revealed that migrant seafood workers face COVID-19 risks without federal safety standards. Has the situation improved? Are there ongoing workplace safety violations that haven't been reported?
- What happened to the additional visa recipients after the pandemic began? Track specific businesses and workers to understand the human impact.
- How do communities like Ocean City prepare for potential labor shortages if the program is reduced or eliminated?

### 287(g) Agreements and ICE Detention

Several Maryland jurisdictions have agreements allowing local law enforcement to act as immigration agents. Three counties—Cecil, Frederick, and Harford—have 287(g) agreements, while Frederick, Howard, and Worcester counties have Intergovernmental Service Agreements to house ICE detainees.

Howard County has earned nearly $20 million since 2013 through its detention agreement, housing ICE detainees at $110 per person per day. Frederick County makes about $1.3 million annually. Anne Arundel County ended its agreements in 2019.

**Stories that need follow-up:**
- What happened after Cecil County's 287(g) agreement became "operational" in 2019? Has it affected immigrant communities' willingness to report crimes?
- Track the outcomes of Frederick County's independent audit of 287(g) spending that began in November 2019.
- How has the University of Maryland handled its terrorism training contract with ICE, which runs through 2022? Student activists demanded its cancellation but received no commitment.

## Key Individuals and Organizations

### Advocates and Service Providers

**CASA de Maryland** is the largest Latino and immigrant advocacy organization in the Mid-Atlantic, with over 90,000 members. The organization operates "welcome centers" including one in Langley Park that connects day laborers with employers while enforcing a $10/hour wage floor. CASA filed a lawsuit in 2017 alleging the Trump administration didn't follow proper procedures in ending DACA and was motivated by racial animus against Mexican and Central American beneficiaries. This case needs follow-up—what was its outcome?

**Key contacts:**
- Gustavo Torres, Executive Director
- Nicholas Katz, Senior Manager of Legal Services
- Cathryn Paul, Research and Policy Analyst

**Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service (Baltimore)**: Krish O'Mara Vignarajah leads this organization, which has resettled hundreds of Afghan evacuees. The organization faces potential funding cuts and may need to implement layoffs depending on refugee admission numbers.

**Episcopal Refugee and Immigrant Center Alliance**: Executive Director Betty Symington has been vocal about the Trump administration's reduction of refugee admissions to historic lows.

### Impacted Individuals

Several individuals shared their stories with Capital News Service. Following up with them could yield powerful updates:

**Nathaly Uribe Robledo** (Glen Burnie): A 22-year-old DACA recipient from Chile who had to withdraw from UMBC in 2014 due to financial struggles. She now works at an insurance agency in Baltimore. Her DACA permit was renewed as recently as July 2017, but she expressed fear about living "undocumented as adults with adult responsibilities."

**Jose Aguiluz** (Silver Spring): A 28-year-old registered nurse from Honduras who has been fighting for immigrant rights since before DACA existed. He worked as an electrician despite having a nursing degree until DACA allowed him to work in his field. His permit was set to expire in November 2018—what happened to him?

**Cindy Kolade** (Baltimore): A 24-year-old clinical lab assistant from Ivory Coast who attends Towson University. She represents the often-overlooked African immigrant community affected by DACA. Her permit extended through February 2019—where is she now?

## Geographic Focus Areas

### Langley Park, Maryland

This small Prince George's County community is approximately 83% Hispanic, with many residents from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. It serves as a hub for day laborers and has been a focal point for immigration enforcement fears.

The community exemplifies the economic challenges facing immigrants. Day laborers often accept wages as low as $5/hour despite state minimum wage requirements, with average annual incomes between $10,000-$15,000. CASA's welcome center operates from a basement location in a strip mall, where outside workers often intercept employers before they can reach CASA's higher-wage system.

**Story opportunities:**
- Document the real impact of underbidding on family economics. How do families survive on $10,000-$15,000 annually in the expensive D.C. metro area?
- Wage theft affects an estimated 20% of jobs for workers like Victor. What legal remedies exist, and how effective are they?
- How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected day labor markets and wages?

### Ocean City, Maryland

This resort town employs about 4,000 J-1 visa holders among its 12,000 seasonal positions. The Trump administration considered reducing or eliminating the J-1 exchange visitor program as part of the "Buy American and Hire American" executive order.

Businesses like Trimper's Rides employ 130 J-1 students and say they couldn't survive without them. The Grand Hotel employs about 100 J-1 workers who fill roles from housekeeping to front desk operations.

**Critical questions:**
- What happened with the J-1 program review? This story from September 2017 noted potential changes but provided no follow-up.
- How did businesses handle the 2018-2020 seasons? Were there actual reductions in available visas?
- What is the economic impact on Ocean City's economy if the program is significantly reduced?

### Baltimore

Baltimore has accepted nearly half of Maryland's refugees since 2000, making it crucial to refugee resettlement efforts. The city's population has been declining for decades, but immigrants have helped slow this loss. In the 12 months ending July 1, 2018, almost 2,000 immigrants moved to Baltimore while the overall population dropped by 7,300.

Jamaica is Baltimore's largest immigrant source country, followed by China, Mexico, and Trinidad. The city is home to significant Korean, Ethiopian, and Indian immigrant communities.

**Underreported stories:**
- How did the reduction in refugee admissions to 18,000 (the lowest level since 1980) affect Baltimore's resettlement organizations? Were there actual layoffs at Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service as feared?
- The Esperanza Center and other service organizations expressed concerns about immigrant communities' access to the 2020 census. What were the actual participation rates?

### Chesapeake Bay Islands (Dorchester County)

This area's seafood processing industry depends heavily on H-2B workers. Companies like Lindy's Seafood employ dozens of seasonal workers from Mexico for crab-picking. In July 2020, seven Lindy's workers contracted COVID-19, and the company was criticized for putting workers to work immediately upon arrival without testing or quarantine.

In April 2021, 59 H-2B workers arrived by bus after a two-day journey and began work the following day without COVID testing. Within a week, several tested positive, though the company initially refused to confirm or deny cases.

**Questions that need answers:**
- What were the final COVID-19 case numbers at Lindy's and other Dorchester County seafood processors?
- Were there any enforcement actions or penalties related to workplace safety violations?
- How did the pandemic affect H-2B worker recruitment and working conditions in subsequent seasons?

## Legal and Policy Developments

### Supreme Court Cases

**Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California (DACA)**: The Supreme Court heard arguments in November 2019 about whether the Trump administration properly ended DACA. The case consolidated challenges from multiple jurisdictions. The University of California sued three days after the DACA rescission was announced in September 2017. This represents one of the most significant immigration cases in recent memory, with potential impacts on 800,000 recipients.

**CASA v. Trump (Birthright Citizenship)**: In January 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order attempting to restrict birthright citizenship. CASA and other organizations filed suit, with the case reaching the Supreme Court. A federal judge granted an injunction blocking the order, but the government appealed. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in May 2025, with the case directly affecting Meny, a pregnant immigrant whose unborn child's citizenship was at stake.

**Follow-up needed:**
- What was the final Supreme Court ruling in the DACA case? How many recipients were able to renew or newly apply?
- What happened to Meny and the other plaintiffs in CASA v. Trump? The case was pending as of May 2025—what was the outcome?
- How many birthright citizenship challenges have been filed since the executive order?

### State and Local Legislation

**Maryland Trust Act**: This legislation would bar police from complying with federal immigration enforcement efforts. The bill did not pass the Maryland General Assembly, but cities like Takoma Park and Hyattsville adopted "sanctuary city" policies independently.

**Dignity Not Detention Act (Maryland)**: Introduced in February 2021, this bill would prevent ICE detention centers from renewing contracts with the state or building new facilities. Opponents including Sheriff Chuck Jenkins argued the bill undermines public safety. The bill did not pass committee.

**Maryland Data Privacy Act**: Introduced in 2021, this bill would prohibit state and local officials from sharing personal information with federal immigration enforcement without a warrant. It builds on the 2021 Driver Privacy Act. The bill has faced opposition from some law enforcement officials.

**Probation Not Deportation (SB0265/HB0559)**: This bill would amend Maryland's Probation Before Judgment law to allow immigrants to receive probation without pleading guilty, avoiding immigration consequences. Attorney General's office supported the bill. Follow-up needed on its passage and implementation.

**Stories needing investigation:**
- What has been the practical effect of sanctuary city policies in Takoma Park and Hyattsville? Have they faced federal funding threats?
- Did any of these bills ultimately pass? Track their progress through multiple legislative sessions.
- How have Maryland counties with 287(g) agreements responded to state-level efforts to limit cooperation with ICE?

## Economic and Workforce Issues

### Economic Contributions

Maryland's immigrant population contributes significantly to the state economy. As of 2018, immigrants made up approximately 15% of Maryland's population, with another 11% being native-born citizens with at least one immigrant parent. Foreign-born residents paid $1.2 billion in taxes in 2022, including $476.3 million in state and local taxes.

Hispanic immigrants in Maryland paid $1.6 billion in taxes, and the state's median household income for Hispanics is the highest in the nation. DACA recipients alone contribute an estimated $509.4 million to Maryland's annual GDP.

### Wage Theft and Labor Exploitation

The Economic Policy Institute estimates that workers lose between $8.6 billion and $13.8 billion annually due to minimum wage violations nationwide. Non-citizens are 1.6 to 3.1 times more likely to experience these violations. In Langley Park, day laborers report being cheated on approximately 20% of jobs, with wage theft ranging from underpayment to complete non-payment.

**Victor**, a construction worker from Guatemala, shared that he's been cheated on as many as 20% of his jobs, sometimes receiving bad checks or being told "I'll call you in a week" only to never hear back. Community Legal Services of Prince George's County reports that wage theft cases are the most frequent they see.

**Critical investigative angles:**
- Wage theft appears severely underreported. What are the actual numbers? How many cases are filed with Maryland Department of Labor?
- Are there patterns in which industries or employers repeatedly violate wage laws?
- What happens to workers who report wage theft? Track specific cases through the legal system.
- How effective are current enforcement mechanisms? Interview workers and attorneys about outcomes.

### Seafood Industry Labor Issues

The Howard Center investigation revealed that H-2B seafood workers face systemic COVID-19 risks. Workers traveled in crowded buses for days without testing, lived in crowded housing, and were often put to work immediately upon arrival. The federal government provided no COVID safety standards for this travel or housing.

Between October 2019 and September 2020, more than 12,000 H-2B visas were authorized for seafood industry workers nationally, including 2,232 for 41 companies in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. Despite this large workforce, OSHA received only 32 COVID-19 complaints against seafood processing companies nationwide from January 2020 through the investigation's publication in May 2021.

**Urgent follow-up needed:**
- The investigation was published in May 2021. Have conditions improved? Are companies now testing workers before they begin work?
- What happened to the specific workers and companies mentioned? Monica, Santiago, and others contracted COVID-19—did they face long-term health consequences?
- Did any companies face penalties for safety violations?
- How many actual COVID-19 cases occurred at Maryland seafood processors? The state wouldn't disclose locations.

## Enforcement and Detention

### ICE Raids and Enforcement Actions

In May 2025, Department of Homeland Security agents visited more than 100 businesses in the Washington D.C. area, including nearly a dozen popular restaurants, to verify I-9 employment forms. Notable targets included Pupatella, Millie's, Chef Geoff's, Chang Chang, and Call Your Mother. The raids did not require warrants and gave businesses just three days to provide employee records.

Bonums Oyster Company in Virginia saw 33 employees test positive for COVID-19 in October 2020 after workers traveled together on a crowded bus from Mexico. VOSH (Virginia's OSHA) closed a complaint about the company without inspection after receiving a letter from company lawyers saying problems were resolved.

**Stories that need reporting:**
- What happened to the D.C. area businesses visited in May 2025? Were there arrests or deportations?
- How many workers lost their jobs due to the raids? What happened to their families?
- Did ICE follow up on the three-day deadline for employee records? Were any businesses penalized?

### Family Separations

The Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy resulted in approximately 5,500 children being separated from parents at the border, with hundreds remaining separated for years. In April 2025, the wrongful deportation of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia became a high-profile case. Despite court orders requiring his return, the Trump administration refused, with President Trump claiming he had no power to bring Garcia back.

Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to meet with Garcia at CECOT, one of the country's most notorious prisons. Maryland filed a lawsuit alongside several other states demanding Garcia's return.

**Critical follow-up questions:**
- Was Kilmar Abrego Garcia ever returned to the United States? The story was ongoing as of May 2025.
- What happened to the 911 children separated from parents in the year ending May 2025? More than half were under age 10, and 185 were five or younger.
- What was the outcome of Maryland's lawsuit regarding Garcia's deportation?
- How many separated children remain in custody or have still not been reunited with parents?

### Afghan Refugees

Following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, Maryland was slated to receive 1,348 evacuees. Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service in Baltimore has resettled approximately 200 Afghan humanitarian parolees and 60 Special Immigrant Visa holders, with expectations to resettle 2,500 more.

However, funding challenges emerged. In September 2021, the State Department told the country's nine refugee resettlement agencies that not all would receive funding. The Afghan Adjustment Act, introduced in July 2021, would provide a pathway to permanent legal status for evacuees currently under temporary humanitarian parole.

**Stories needing coverage:**
- How many Afghan evacuees ultimately settled in Maryland? Where did they go?
- Did Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service face the predicted layoffs?
- What happened to the Afghan Adjustment Act? Has it passed?
- How are Afghan evacuees faring economically? What barriers do they face without permanent legal status?
- What about child care support for Afghan families, which was identified as a critical need?

## Census and Demographic Change

The 2020 census presented unique challenges for immigrant communities. The Trump administration's attempt to include a citizenship question (blocked by the Supreme Court in June 2019) created widespread fear despite the question's removal. CASA and other organizations conducted extensive outreach, but many immigrants remained fearful about participating.

Maryland spent $5 million on outreach to "hard-to-count" communities, with about $450,000 going to CASA. Baltimore focused particular attention on immigrant communities, with the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs coordinating citywide efforts.

**What happened:**
- Were participation rates in immigrant communities lower than expected? Compare census tract data from 2010 and 2020.
- How much federal funding did Maryland lose (or gain) based on population counts?
- Did the citizenship question controversy have lasting effects on immigrant communities' trust in government data collection?

## Key Policy Debates

### Birthright Citizenship

President Trump issued an executive order on January 20, 2025, attempting to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents without legal status. The order directly violated the 14th Amendment, which states "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens."

Maryland joined more than a dozen states in challenging the order. CASA filed its own lawsuit, with plaintiff "Meny"—a pregnant California resident—whose unborn child's citizenship was at stake. The Supreme Court heard arguments in May 2025.

**Critical questions:**
- What was the Supreme Court's ruling? This is a case of major constitutional significance.
- How many children have been denied birth certificates or citizenship documents since the executive order?
- What is happening to children born during the period of legal uncertainty?

### Terminology and Language

In 2020, the State Department made several changes to immigration-related language, removing terms like "illegal alien" from federal documents in some cases while President Trump increased his use of the term. Trump used "illegal alien" 123 times in 2018, up from just three times in 2017.

In October 2019, New York City's Commission on Human Rights banned use of "illegal alien" when meant to "demean, humiliate or harass," with violations potentially resulting in fines up to $250,000.

Representative Joaquin Castro introduced the CHANGE Act (Correcting Hurtful and Alienating Names in Government Expression Act) to replace "illegal alien" with "foreign national" or "undocumented foreign national" in federal documents.

**Story angles:**
- Track actual usage of these terms in federal, state, and local documents. Has language changed?
- What has been the practical impact of New York's terminology ban?
- Did the CHANGE Act pass? What resistance did it face?

## Caveats for Reporters

### Ongoing and Unresolved Issues

## Conclusion

Immigration coverage demands sensitivity, persistence, and attention to both policy developments and human impacts. The stories in this guide reveal a complex landscape where federal, state, and local policies intersect with the daily lives of nearly a million Maryland immigrants.

Many critical questions remain unanswered. Legal cases continue through the courts. Individuals who shared their stories years ago face uncertain futures. Enforcement actions create ongoing trauma. Economic exploitation persists.

Your job is to find these stories, verify what you can, acknowledge what remains unclear, and tell the truth about how immigration policy affects real people. Build trust with immigrant communities. Follow cases through the legal system. Hold institutions accountable. Document both challenges and resilience.

Remember that immigration is not just about policy—it's about families, dreams, contributions, and the ongoing question of who belongs in America. Every statistic represents a person. Every policy has a human cost or benefit. Your reporting should reflect that reality.
