# Immigration Coverage: A Comprehensive Guide for Journalists

This guide provides essential background for reporting on immigration issues affecting Maryland and the broader United States, with a focus on stories that need coverage, ongoing situations requiring follow-up, and critical context for understanding this complex policy area.

## Key People and Institutions

### Federal Officials and Agencies
President Trump has been central to immigration policy shifts, particularly regarding DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which his administration attempted to terminate in 2017. The Supreme Court's eventual ruling on DACA became a pivotal moment. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are the primary federal enforcement agencies. Attorney General positions under different administrations have significantly influenced enforcement priorities.

### Maryland Leadership
Maryland Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin have consistently advocated for immigrant protections, introducing legislation like the SECURE Act and pushing for visa reforms affecting seafood workers. Governor Larry Hogan has taken more mixed positions, supporting economic needs like H-2B visas while not always aligning with Democratic lawmakers on sanctuary policies. Attorney General Brian Frosh joined multi-state lawsuits challenging Trump administration immigration policies.

### Advocacy Organizations
CASA de Maryland is the largest regional immigrant advocacy organization, providing legal services, operating worker centers, and leading political campaigns. They run DACA renewal clinics and help immigrants navigate wage theft complaints. The Immigrant Legal Resource Center, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, and Centro de los Derechos del Migrante are national organizations with Maryland presences. The Episcopal Refugee and Immigrant Center Alliance and various faith-based groups provide direct services.

## Critical Policy Areas Requiring Coverage

### DACA and Dreamers
The Supreme Court heard arguments in November 2019 on the legality of ending DACA, with Maryland home to approximately 9,700 recipients as of March 2018. **Ongoing story**: While a December 2021 court ruling restored DACA to its original form, the program's long-term future remains uncertain. Reporters should track how Maryland's DACA population has changed, what these individuals are doing now, and whether promised legislative solutions have materialized. The stories published show emotional testimony from recipients but lack follow-up on their current situations.

### Birthright Citizenship
In January 2021, the Trump administration attempted to end birthright citizenship through executive order. Maryland joined other states in legal challenges. The CASA v. Trump case went to the Supreme Court with oral arguments held in May 2025. **This is unresolved**: The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on this case. Reporters should monitor for the decision and prepare stories about how the ruling will affect Maryland families, particularly the nine pregnant women who were plaintiffs, including "Meny" who was featured in coverage. The impact extends to Maryland's substantial immigrant population where many have U.S.-born children.

### Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED)
These programs affect thousands of Maryland residents from countries including El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras and Liberia. **Story gap**: While 2017 coverage showed protests by Liberians facing DED expiration, there's no follow-up on what happened to these communities. Did extensions come through? How many people were actually deported? What happened to families? The emotional stories from 2017 need resolution.

### Refugee Resettlement
Maryland historically accepts a disproportionate share of refugees relative to its population. The Trump administration reduced the refugee ceiling to historic lows (18,000 in fiscal 2020, down from 110,000 in 2017). Baltimore has accepted nearly half of Maryland's refugees since 2000. **Follow-up needed**: How did the Biden administration's refugee policies affect Maryland? Which organizations survived the funding cuts? What happened to the refugees who arrived? The stories from 2019 and 2021 about Afghan evacuees and service cuts need updates.

### Wrongful Deportations
The Kilmar Abrego García case received extensive coverage in 2021, with Maryland Senator Van Hollen traveling to El Salvador to check on him. García was mistakenly deported to a notorious prison despite court orders. **Unresolved**: It's unclear if García was ever returned to the United States or if his case was resolved. This story needs closure. Additionally, reporters should investigate whether Maryland has seen other cases of wrongful deportation and what safeguards exist to prevent this.

## Economic and Workforce Issues

### H-2B Visa Program
Maryland's seafood industry depends heavily on H-2B seasonal workers, particularly for crab picking. More than 12,000 H-2B visas were authorized for seafood processing in 2019-2020, with 2,232 going to Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina companies. The lottery system for these visas creates uncertainty for businesses. Ocean City businesses similarly depend on J-1 visa holders (international students) for summer tourism season work.

**Undercovered angles**: 
- How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect these workers and businesses long-term? The May 2021 investigation into unsafe conditions for H-2B workers during COVID deserves follow-up on whether conditions improved and if there were legal or regulatory consequences.
- What are current visa numbers and are businesses still struggling to find workers?
- Beyond economic impacts, what's the human story of these workers' lives and their treatment?

### Wage Theft and Day Laborers
The 2017 investigation into Langley Park day laborers revealed systematic wage theft affecting immigrant workers, with wages often dropping below minimum wage due to oversupply of workers. CASA operates worker centers with wage floors, but many workers operate outside this system.

**Story needs**: This deserves an update. Did the minimum wage increases in Maryland and Prince George's County change anything? How did the Trump administration's immigration enforcement affect workers' willingness to report wage theft? Have there been successful prosecutions? The Community Legal Services center mentioned handling many wage theft cases but without specifics on outcomes.

### Healthcare Access
A 2024 bill would have allowed undocumented immigrants to purchase health insurance through Maryland's exchange. **Follow-up needed**: Did this pass? If so, how many people enrolled and what has been the impact? If not, what happened and might it be reintroduced?

## ICE Detention and 287(g) Agreements

Maryland counties including Frederick, Harford, Cecil, Howard and Worcester have had contracts with ICE for detention facilities or 287(g) agreements authorizing local officers to perform immigration enforcement. These contracts bring revenue but create community tensions.

**Key questions**:
- Anne Arundel County ended its ICE detention agreement in early 2019. What were the financial and community impacts?
- The "Dignity Not Detention Act" was introduced in Maryland in 2021 to prevent ICE detention centers from renewing contracts. Did this pass? If not, why not, and are these facilities still operating?
- How many people are currently detained in Maryland ICE facilities?
- Have there been documented cases of abuse or rights violations?
- Cecil County signed a 287(g) agreement in February 2019. How has this affected the community?

## Emerging and Ongoing Enforcement Issues

### Census Participation
CASA and other organizations ran major campaigns before the 2020 census to ensure immigrant communities were counted despite fears about a citizenship question. **No coverage found**: Did Maryland's immigrant communities participate fully in the census? What do the results show about population changes? This would involve data analysis of 2020 census results compared to estimates.

### State and Local Sanctuary Policies
The Maryland Trust Act, which would limit police cooperation with ICE, has been proposed multiple times but coverage suggests it has not passed. Cities including Takoma Park and Hyattsville declared themselves sanctuary cities. Baltimore Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs was created in 2015.

**Coverage gaps**: 
- What is the current status of sanctuary policies across Maryland?
- Have there been conflicts between local sanctuary policies and federal enforcement?
- How has this affected community policing and crime reporting in immigrant neighborhoods?

### Workplace Raids and Restaurant Enforcement
The May 2025 story about DHS visiting more than 100 Washington-area businesses, including restaurants like Lindy's Seafood and Pupatella, represents a significant enforcement action. **This is breaking/ongoing**: The story notes it's unclear if the issue has been resolved. Reporters should follow up on whether additional visits occurred, if any deportations resulted, and how businesses and immigrant communities have responded. The notice gave businesses three days to provide employee records, but it's unclear what happened next.

### Chinese Student Visas
The May 2025 story mentions hundreds of Chinese students had visas revoked due to U.S.-China tensions, affecting those at University of Maryland. **Significant underreporting**: This deserves much deeper coverage. How many Maryland students were affected? What happened to them? How are universities responding? This touches on both immigration and academic freedom issues.

## Geographic Focus Areas

### Langley Park
This Prince George's County community is predominantly Central American (83% Hispanic in the census) and has been a center for day laborer organizing, CASA's headquarters, and census participation efforts. It represents the intersection of multiple immigration issues.

### Baltimore
The city has lost population overall but immigrants have slowed the decline. Jamaicans are the largest immigrant group in Baltimore. The city has nearly half of Maryland's refugees since 2000. Baltimore has an Office of Immigrant Affairs and was early to declare itself welcoming to immigrants. Stories show the city's diversity (Jamaican, Chinese, African communities) but lack depth on how immigrant communities are actually faring economically and socially.

### Eastern Shore and Seafood Industry
Dorchester County islands, including areas around Cambridge and Fishing Creek, have been focal points for H-2B seafood workers. The 2021 investigation revealed COVID-19 outbreaks and poor working conditions at facilities like Lindy's Seafood. **Follow-up needed**: What changed after the investigation? Were there health department interventions or policy changes?

### Montgomery and Prince George's Counties
These two counties contain the majority of Maryland's DACA-eligible population. Montgomery County is more than 30% foreign-born. This is where most immigrant services, organizing, and policy debates are concentrated.

## Undercovered Story Ideas

### Family Separation Long-Term Impacts
The September 2018 congressional testimony described lifelong trauma for children separated at the border, with 911 children separated in the year prior. Maryland likely has families affected. **Story opportunity**: Find Maryland families affected by separation policies and tell their stories now, years later. Are children reunited? What services exist for trauma?

### Immigration Court Backlog
Multiple stories mention Maryland's immigration court backlog (50,000 cases as of February 2025). **Deep dive needed**: What does this backlog mean in practice? Profile several people waiting years for hearings. What happens to their lives in limbo? How do the courts function and who are the judges?

### Muslim Travel Ban Aftermath
The 2017 travel ban affected Maryland's significant Nigerian, Iranian, Somali and other Muslim immigrant populations. After various court challenges, what were the actual impacts on Maryland communities? Are there people still separated from family members?

### Green Card Changes and Public Charge
The September 2018 "Washington Bullpen" podcast mentions proposed green card law changes. **Unclear**: What happened with public charge rules that would deny green cards to immigrants using public benefits? How did this affect Maryland immigrants' use of services they're entitled to?

### State Legislation Outcomes
Multiple bills were introduced in Maryland's General Assembly regarding immigrants but their outcomes are unclear:
- Probation Not Deportation (SB0265/HB0559) to prevent guilty pleas from triggering deportation
- Data Privacy Act to protect immigrant data from federal immigration enforcement
- Protecting Sensitive Locations Act to limit ICE access to schools, hospitals, courthouses

**Research needed**: Track what happened to these bills. Did they pass? If not, why not, and will they be reintroduced?

### Haitian Community Uncertainty
The 2019 story mentions thousands of Haitian immigrants in Salisbury area who came under humanitarian parole starting in 2023, with the program ended by Trump. **Major gap**: What happened to this community? The story specifically mentions their uncertain status and fear. This needs follow-up.

### Immigrant Contributions Data
Maryland organizations have published data showing immigrants paid $1.6 billion in taxes (Hispanic immigrants specifically), that immigrants are vital to healthcare and research industries, and that many industries would collapse without immigrant labor. **Story opportunity**: Create a comprehensive data analysis of immigrants' economic contributions to Maryland across all sectors, with real people's stories illustrating the data.

### Naturalization Process Changes
The November 2020 story detailed how the Trump administration made the citizenship test harder, longer and more conservative. Did the Biden administration reverse this? How has this affected naturalization rates in Maryland?

### Language Access
Maryland is among the most diverse states with residents speaking many languages. What language access exists in schools, hospitals, courts and government services? Where are the gaps? This affects immigrants' ability to access services and exercise rights.

## Critical Context and Framing

### Language Matters
The use of "illegal alien" versus "undocumented immigrant" or other terms is politically charged. The October 2019 investigation showed Trump dramatically increased use of "illegal alien" and "criminal aliens" in speeches. New York City banned the term when used to harass. The AP changed its stylebook. Reporters should be conscious of how language choices affect framing and consider using specific, accurate descriptions of people's immigration status.

### Statistical Context
Studies consistently show immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born citizens. Only 2% of immigrants are felons compared to 6% of U.S. citizens. Despite this, the Trump administration's rhetoric emphasized immigrant criminality. Reporters should always provide this context when covering crime stories involving immigrants.

### Economic Contributions
Data shows immigrants are net contributors to Maryland's economy through taxes, entrepreneurship and labor. They fill critical workforce gaps in industries including seafood processing, construction, healthcare, hospitality and agriculture. However, some immigrant workers are exploited through wage theft and unsafe conditions. Both aspects deserve coverage.

### Racial and Ethnic Dimensions
Immigration debates often carry racial undertones. The December 2024 story about Maryland's changing demographics notes the state is becoming more diverse, with no single racial majority expected nationally by 2055. Coverage should explore how immigration intersects with racial justice issues and how communities are actually integrating.

### Legal System Complexity
Immigration law is notoriously complex. Stories should explain terms like "withholding of removal," "parole," "TPS," "DED," "asylum" and various visa categories clearly. Many people have mixed-status families where some members are citizens, others have legal status, and others are undocumented. This complexity deserves explanation.

## Key Takeaways for Reporters

Maryland is home to nearly 1 million immigrants who are reshaping the state demographically and economically. Immigration touches nearly every policy area from education to healthcare to criminal justice to economic development. The Trump and Biden administrations represented dramatically different approaches to immigration, creating uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of Maryland residents.

The coverage reviewed shows strong breaking news reporting on major policy changes and good feature storytelling on individual immigrants' experiences. However, there are significant gaps in follow-up reporting on outcomes, data analysis of trends, investigation of local enforcement, and coverage of immigrant communities beyond Latino populations.

The most important undercovered stories involve resolution of uncertain situations (DACA, birthright citizenship, wrongful deportations), long-term impacts of family separation and enforcement, state-level policy outcomes, conditions for immigrant workers, and comprehensive data on immigrants' contributions to and integration into Maryland communities.

Immigration coverage should strive to be both empathetic to human stories and rigorous in examining policy impacts, provide proper context about legal complexity and statistical reality, avoid inflammatory language while accurately describing situations, hold both government and private sector actors accountable for their treatment of immigrants, and follow up on unresolved situations to provide closure and lessons learned.
