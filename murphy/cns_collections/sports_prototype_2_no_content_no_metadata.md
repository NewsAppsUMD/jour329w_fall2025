# Navigating Maryland Sports: A Guide for Early-Career Journalists

## Understanding the Landscape

Maryland and the surrounding DMV area (D.C., Maryland, Virginia) offers a dense concentration of sports stories spanning professional teams, college athletics, high school sports, and emerging trends that are reshaping American athletics. This region serves as a microcosm for national sports conversations while maintaining distinct local angles.

## The NIL Revolution in High School Sports

One of the most significant ongoing stories involves Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) compensation for high school athletes. This represents a fundamental shift in amateur athletics that's still playing out in real time.

### What's Happened So Far

In May 2025, the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism released a comprehensive four-month investigation into NIL at the high school level. The series revealed that 41 states and Washington D.C. now permit high school athletes to profit from their NIL, but with wildly varying regulations across state lines ([High School Sports and NIL: An Explainer](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/06/high-school-sports-and-nil-an-explainer/), May 2025).

Maryland changed its rules in December 2022, with volleyball star Alexis Ewing from Bullis School becoming one of the first athletes in the state to sign an NIL deal with College HUNKS Hauling Junk & Moving ([For College HUNKS, Portland Gear, high school athletes are star endorsers](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/06/for-college-hunks-portland-gear-high-school-athletes-are-star-endorsers/), May 2025).

### Stories That Need Coverage

**The education gap**: Only North Carolina has implemented mandatory education programs for athletes and families navigating NIL deals, leaving most young athletes to figure things out on their own ([Boom in NIL opportunities exposes need for education for athletes and their parents](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/06/boom-in-nil-opportunities-exposes-need-for-education-for-athletes-and-their-parents/), May 2025). What are Maryland schools doing to prepare athletes? Are local districts developing curriculum or resources?

**The transfer question**: A May 2025 story noted that high-profile transfers, including a star basketball player moving to a rival school, raised questions about NIL's influence on recruitment, though no direct links were established ([Impact of NIL on transfers is unknown but raises questions for high school officials](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/06/impact-of-nil-on-transfers-is-unknown-but-raises-questions-for-high-school-officials/), May 2025). **Important caveat**: This remains murky territory. Has anyone established concrete evidence of NIL-driven transfers in Maryland? What are athletic directors actually seeing versus fearing?

**Little League's position**: The Little League World Series attracts larger TV audiences than some major league games, yet Little League hasn't established clear NIL policies for participants, citing concerns about high school eligibility ([Little League Baseball provides big stage for youth athletes but its NIL rules are murky](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/06/little-league-world-series-provides-big-stage-for-youth-athletes-but-its-nil-rules-are-murky/), May 2025). Are Maryland Little League organizations developing their own guidance? What happens when a 12-year-old goes viral?

**Questions to ask:**
- How many Maryland high school athletes have actually signed NIL deals since December 2022?
- What types of companies are approaching high school athletes versus college athletes?
- Are there disparities based on sport, gender, or school type (public versus private)?
- How are college recruiters viewing high school NIL activity?

## Professional Sports in Transition

### The Orioles' Trajectory

After a 101-win 2023 season that ended in playoff disappointment, the Orioles added starting pitcher Corbin Burnes and welcomed highly touted prospect Jackson Holliday. However, Holliday's debut was historically poor—he hit just .059 over his first 10 games before being sent to Triple-A ([Jackson Holliday's early MLB struggles were historic among top draft picks](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/07/jackson-hollidays-early-mlb-struggles-were-historic-among-top-draft-picks/), May 2024).

**Follow-up needed**: What's Holliday's current status? How has his development progressed? The story from May 2024 left this unresolved.

The organization has also shifted its international scouting strategy under leadership that began in 2018, increasing focus on non-American players in minor league affiliates ([Orioles' international scouting strategy initiates shifts in team characteristics](https://cnsmaryland.org/2023/05/09/baltimore-orioles-international-scouting-diversity-changes/), May 2023). Track how this pipeline is developing and whether international players are reaching the major league roster.

### The Nationals' Historic Decline

After winning the 2019 World Series, the Nationals experienced one of the worst post-championship collapses in baseball history, posting a .407 winning percentage over the following five seasons—second only to the 1913 Philadelphia Athletics ([After World Series triumph, Nats suffer a historic five-year fade](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/10/02/after-world-series-triumph-nats-suffer-an-historic-five-year-fade/), October 2024). This represents a fascinating case study in roster management and organizational decision-making after a championship.

**Stories to pursue**: What specific decisions led to this decline? How are current management and ownership approaching the rebuild? What lessons can be learned?

### Washington Commanders and the Wentz Era

The Commanders traded significant draft capital for quarterback Carson Wentz in March 2022, reflecting desperation to find stability at the position ([With Wentz in the wings, Commanders hope for turnaround. Again.](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/03/15/with-wentz-in-the-wings-commanders-hope-for-turnaround-again/), March 2022). **Important**: This story is now dated, and the team's quarterback situation has likely changed. What happened with Wentz? Who's starting now? This needs a current assessment.

The team also rebranded from its previous controversial name, though the reporting suggests organizational issues remained under owner Dan Snyder. Has ownership changed? What's the current state of the franchise?

### Capitals in Flux

Spencer Carbery became the Capitals' new head coach, emphasizing the importance of younger players for cap relief and roster depth. The team held rookie camp at McMullen Arena in Annapolis in September 2023 ([Capitals to hold rookie camp at McMullen Arena in Annapolis](https://cnsmaryland.org/2023/09/15/capitals-to-hold-rookie-camp-at-mcmullen-arena-in-annapolis/), September 2023). 

**Follow-up needed**: How has Carbery's first full season or more gone? Which young players have emerged? The team's core stars, including Alex Ovechkin, are aging—what does the transition plan look like?

## College Athletics at Maryland

### Basketball Attendance Disparities

Despite Maryland women's basketball achieving its highest regular season attendance in over a decade during the 2022-23 season, the team still drew nearly half the audience of the men's team ([Maryland Women's Basketball regular season attendance skyrockets but inequality still prevalent](https://cnsmaryland.org/2023/04/13/maryland-womens-basketball-regular-season-attendance-skyrockets-but-inequality-still-prevalent/), April 2023). Both teams also face challenges filling the cavernous Xfinity Center, which seats nearly 18,000 ([Maryland basketball games can look empty inside the cavernous Xfinity Center](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/04/18/maryland-basketball-games-can-look-empty-inside-the-cavernous-xfinity-center/), April 2024).

**Story angles**: What marketing strategies are working or failing? How do ticket prices compare? What role does winning play—the men's team had a losing record, which was rare. Has attendance recovered or continued declining?

### Coaching Transitions

Caitlyn Phipps, who led Maryland women's lacrosse to five NCAA championships over a decade, left to become Georgetown's head coach in October 2024 ([Caitlyn Phipps begins her next chapter as Georgetown University's new head coach](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/10/30/caitlyn-phipps-begins-her-next-chapter-as-georgetown-universitys-new-head-coach/), October 2024). 

**Follow-up needed**: Who replaced her at Maryland? How has the transition affected the program? How is Phipps doing at Georgetown?

### Football Program Directions

Mike Locksley continues as head coach, and the team has emphasized local recruiting. Beau Brade, a Maryland safety, signed with the Baltimore Ravens as an undrafted free agent, fulfilling his dream of playing for his hometown team ([Beau Brade stays home after going undrafted in NFL Draft](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/11/beau-brade-stays-home-after-going-undrafted-in-nfl-draft/), May 2024).

Maryland colleges have produced over 300 NFL Draft picks since 1936, with 70 percent being Terrapins ([Maryland colleges have produced over 300 NFL Draft picks](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/04/23/maryland-colleges-have-produced-over-300-nfl-draft-picks/), April 2024). This pipeline story deserves regular updates.

## Pimlico and Horse Racing's Troubled Waters

Maryland lawmakers approved legislation in April 2024 for a three-year renovation of Pimlico Race Course, with the Stronach Group transferring ownership to the state ([Pimlico Race Course, home of the Preakness, will undergo a 3-year renovation](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/04/11/new-plans-to-rebuild-pimlico-race-course/), April 2024).

**Critical ongoing story**: What's the current status of this renovation? Has construction begun? The Preakness Stakes in May 2023 occurred under scrutiny following horse deaths at Churchill Downs, with protesters from Horseracing Wrongs gathering outside Pimlico. One horse, Havnameltdown, died on Preakness race day ([The Preakness was under the spotlight after deaths at Churchill Downs earlier this month](https://cnsmaryland.org/2023/05/21/the-preakness-was-under-the-spotlight-after-deaths-at-churchill-downs-earlier-this-month/), May 2023).

Additionally, Laurel Park temporarily shut down due to horse deaths before implementing new safety measures in October 2023 ([As Laurel Park readies for Maryland Million, experts discuss safety of troubled sport](https://cnsmaryland.org/2023/10/10/as-laurel-park-readies-for-maryland-million-experts-discuss-safety-of-troubled-sport/), October 2023).

**Questions to ask**: What safety protocols are now in place at both tracks? Have they been effective? What do fatality statistics look like since the reforms? How has attendance been affected?

## Basketball Development Initiatives in Africa

Maryland journalists produced extensive reporting in 2024 about NBA Academy Africa in Senegal and the Basketball Africa League (BAL). This represents a significant investment by the NBA in developing African talent, with strong connections to the DMV area.

Amadou Gallo Fall, a former University of District of Columbia player, spearheaded the BAL ([From D.C. to Dakar, basketball connections stretch over the Atlantic](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/08/07/from-d-c-to-dakar-basketball-connections-stretch-over-the-atlantic/), August 2024). Many key figures in African basketball have ties to universities in the D.C., Maryland, and Virginia region.

Nick Faust, a Baltimore native, won the BAL championship with Petro de Luanda in June 2024 after overcoming disappointments including missing an NBA opportunity ([Baltimore to Angola: Nick Faust's Basketball Journey](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/06/01/baltimore-to-angola-nick-fausts-basketball-journey/), June 2024).

**Story angles**: Are there other DMV-area players competing internationally? How does the African basketball development pipeline connect to local colleges and high schools? What role are local coaches playing in international basketball growth?

## Youth Sports and Community Development

### Football Participation and Demographics

A February 2024 investigation revealed that Black and Hispanic parents are nearly twice as likely as white parents to view youth football as a path to college scholarships and the NFL ([Poll: Black, Hispanic parents nearly twice as likely as white parents to see youth football as a path to college scholarships, NFL](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/02/05/poll-black-hispanic-parents-nearly-twice-as-likely-as-white-parents-to-see-youth-football-as-a-path-to-college-scholarships-nfl/), February 2024).

The investigation explored how race and location affect parental decisions about tackle football despite growing concerns over brain injuries. In rural Mississippi, football remains crucial for families with limited options and serves as a potential escape from poverty ([With few other options, football is hope for families in rural Mississippi](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/02/05/with-few-other-options-football-is-hope-for-families-in-rural-mississippi/), February 2024).

**Local angles**: How do participation rates vary across Maryland's diverse communities? What role does socioeconomic status play in these decisions locally? Are there Maryland communities where football serves a similar function as in rural Mississippi?

### Hagerstown Baseball Revival

Hagerstown is building a 3,000-seat ballpark downtown, set to open in spring 2024 to host an Atlantic League expansion team ([Hagerstown's new ballpark: Picnic areas, walking paths and high expectations](https://cnsmaryland.org/2023/07/06/new-hagerstown-stadium-brings-a-whole-new-ballgame-to-the-city/), July 2023). The city has deep baseball history but saw youth participation decline after its professional team disbanded in 2020 ([Could new baseball team bring Little League spirit back to Hagerstown?](https://cnsmaryland.org/2023/07/06/could-new-baseball-team-bring-little-league-spirit-back-to-hagerstown/), July 2023).

**Follow-up needed**: Did the ballpark open on schedule in spring 2024? How has the first season (or more) gone? Has youth baseball participation rebounded? What impact has the team had on downtown Hagerstown?

## Emerging Athletes and Human Interest

### Lisa Markland's Paralympic Journey

Lisa Markland, a Germantown resident and former top athlete who had to withdraw before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, is making a comeback with sights set on the 2028 Summer Paralympics in Los Angeles ([Germantown Senior Aims for 2028 Paralympics](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/06/02/germantown-senior-aims-for-2028-paralympics/), June 2025). 

**Follow-up potential**: This is a recent story with significant runway. Track her training and qualification progress. What sport does she compete in? What caused her to step down in 2008? This represents a compelling long-term narrative about resilience and second chances.

### Frances Tiafoe's Community Impact

Tennis star Frances Tiafoe launched the Frances Tiafoe Fund with a $50,000 initial gift to support the Junior Tennis Champions Center in College Park, where he trained as a youth ([Frances Tiafoe gives back to College Park youth tennis center via charitable fund](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/24/frances-tiafoe-gives-back-to-college-park-youth-tennis-center-via-charitable-fund/), March 2025). The fund aims to promote opportunities for underprivileged youth in Prince George's County.

**Story opportunities**: How much has the fund raised since March 2025? How many young players have benefited? What's Tiafoe's current professional ranking and performance? Are other local athletes following his philanthropic model?

### Allie Coyle Makes History

Allie Coyle became the first female head coach to win a Maryland Boys' Soccer State Title when her Montgomery Blair High School team won their first state championship in over 50 years ([Allie Coyle becomes the first female to win a Maryland Boys' Soccer State Title](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/29/allie-coyle-becomes-the-first-female-to-win-a-maryland-boys-soccer-state-title/), March 2025).

**Follow-up potential**: How has the next season gone? What challenges did she face, and how did she overcome skepticism? Are other female coaches gaining opportunities in boys' sports?

## Sports Betting and College Partnerships

Maryland launched retail sports betting in December 2021, but as of April 2022, mobile options hadn't been implemented due to delays by the Sports Wagering Application Review Commission ([Months after the launch of retail sports betting in Maryland, mobile options have yet to get off the ground](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/04/19/months-after-the-launch-of-retail-sports-betting-in-maryland-mobile-options-have-yet-to-get-off-the-ground/), April 2022).

**Critical follow-up needed**: This information is nearly three years old. Mobile betting has almost certainly launched by now. What's the current state of Maryland's sports betting market? What revenue has the state collected? What problems have emerged?

A February 2023 investigation explored sports betting companies' partnerships with universities, including PointsBet's deal with the University of Colorado Boulder, where marketing targets students despite many being under the legal gambling age ([At University of Colorado, a betting playbook aims its pitch at students](https://cnsmaryland.org/2023/02/27/at-one-school-a-sports-betting-company-aims-its-pitch-at-students/), February 2023).

**Local angles**: Do Maryland universities have similar partnerships? What policies govern sports betting advertising on college campuses in the state? What resources exist for students with gambling problems?

## Key Institutions and People to Know

### Universities and Athletic Programs

**University of Maryland, College Park**: The flagship state university with Big Ten athletic programs. Key figures include Mike Locksley (football coach) and Brenda Frese (women's basketball coach). The Xfinity Center hosts basketball and gymnastics.

**Johns Hopkins University**: Known for lacrosse excellence, with a historic rivalry against Maryland dating back over a century ([The University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University men's lacrosse rivalry runs deep](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/04/18/the-university-of-maryland-and-johns-hopkins-university-mens-lacrosse-rivalry-runs-deep/), April 2024).

**Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)**: Morgan State and Coppin State in Baltimore, Bowie State in Prince George's County. These institutions often face different resource challenges but maintain proud athletic traditions.

### Professional Venues

**Camden Yards**: Home of the Baltimore Orioles since 1992, located in downtown Baltimore. Opening Day is a major civic event ([Sellouts and snowstorms: The history of Opening Day in Baltimore](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/03/27/sellouts-and-snowstorms-the-history-of-opening-day-in-baltimore/), March 2027).

**Capital One Arena**: Washington Capitals and Wizards home arena in downtown Washington D.C.

**Nationals Park**: Washington Nationals' home in the Navy Yard neighborhood of D.C.

**FedEx Field**: Washington Commanders' stadium in Landover, Maryland, though the team's future home is uncertain.

### Organizations

**Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism**: Based at the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism, the center produces in-depth sports investigations and trains student journalists ([About The Povich Center](https://cnsmaryland.org/2023/09/18/about-the-povich-center/), September 2023).

**Maryland State Athletic Associations**: Oversee high school sports, including NIL policies.

## What's Missing from Coverage

Several areas need more attention:

**Women's sports equity**: While there's been coverage of attendance disparities in college basketball, broader questions about resources, media coverage, and opportunities for female athletes deserve ongoing investigation.

**Youth sports costs**: How much does it cost for families to participate in travel teams, elite training, and showcases? How does this affect access across different socioeconomic groups in Maryland?

**Concussion protocols**: Despite national attention on brain injuries, local implementation of safety measures and compliance with protocols needs regular monitoring at both high school and college levels.

**Sports facility conditions**: What's the state of high school athletic facilities across Maryland? Are there disparities based on district wealth or demographics?

**Mental health support**: What resources exist for student-athletes dealing with pressure, anxiety, and performance issues? The December 2022 investigation into elite high school sports noted young athletes face intense pressure ([Too much, too soon? Elite high school sports put young athletes in a pressure cooker](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/12/07/too-much-too-soon-elite-high-school-sports-put-young-athletes-in-a-pressure-cooker/), December 2022), but follow-up on solutions is sparse.

**Climate change impacts**: A December 2019 piece explored how climate change will affect sports globally ([More domed stadiums, fewer ski resorts: Expect climate change to affect sports around the world](https://cnsmaryland.org/2019/12/18/more-domed-stadiums-fewer-ski-resorts-expect-climate-change-to-affect-sports-around-the-world/), December 2019), but local Maryland angles remain unexplored. How are extreme heat and weather variability affecting local youth sports schedules and participation?

## Reporting Tips

When covering these topics, remember that sports stories often connect to larger social issues: education, economics, health, race, and community identity. The best sports journalism recognizes these connections.

Always verify current information, especially for older stories. The sports landscape changes rapidly—coaching changes, player transfers, business deals, and policy updates happen constantly. What was true in 2022 or 2023 may no longer be accurate.

Build relationships with athletic directors, coaches, and athletes across different levels and types of programs. Diverse sources lead to better, more complete stories.

Finally, don't ignore the human element. Stories about Lisa Markland's Paralympic dreams, Caleb Krewson playing lacrosse in a wheelchair, or Nick Faust's journey from Baltimore to Angola resonate because they're fundamentally about people pursuing goals against obstacles. Statistics and policy matter, but personal stories make readers care.
