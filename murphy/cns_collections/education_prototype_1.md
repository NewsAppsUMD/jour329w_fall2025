# Education Beat Guide for Maryland

## Overview

Education in Maryland is undergoing significant transformation, with major policy debates, funding challenges, and innovative programs reshaping how students learn from pre-K through higher education. As a journalist covering this beat, you'll encounter complex issues ranging from a multi-billion dollar education reform plan to ongoing concerns about school safety, mental health services, and educational equity.

## The Blueprint for Maryland's Future: The Dominant Story

The most significant ongoing story is the **Blueprint for Maryland's Future** (formerly known as the Kirwan Commission recommendations). This sweeping $30+ billion education reform plan over 10 years represents the state's attempt to transform public education through five key pillars:

1. **Early Childhood Education** - Expanding pre-K access
2. **High Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders** - Improving recruitment, retention, and pay
3. **College and Career Readiness** - Enhancing pathways to success
4. **Increased Resources** - More funding for high-needs schools
5. **Governance and Accountability** - Oversight mechanisms

### Key Questions to Pursue:

**Implementation and Funding:**
- How are individual school districts implementing Blueprint requirements, and which are struggling most? The February 2024 articles show significant county-by-county variation in readiness.
- **Caveat**: The funding model remains contentious. Multiple stories from 2024 indicate the Blueprint may face a budget crisis by 2029, with no clear long-term funding strategy despite Democrats' commitment to the plan.
- What specific programs have launched with Blueprint money, and what early results are emerging?

**The Budget Crisis:**
- Follow up on Governor Moore's proposed cuts to the Blueprint, particularly the youth mental health funding reduction from $110 million to $40 million ("Maryland spent big on youth mental health — but then the budget crisis hit," February 2024). **This is ongoing and unresolved.**
- How are counties responding to what many call inadequate state funding? Stories from February 2024 show county officials like Harford County Executive Bob Cassilly calling the Blueprint "unrealistic" and "unfunded."

**Pre-K Expansion Challenges:**
- Maryland is struggling to enlist private childcare providers in the Blueprint's pre-K expansion (July 2024). Nearly 40% of providers are declining participation. Why? What are the barriers?
- **Story idea**: Profile specific childcare centers that chose not to participate and those that did. What's different about their experiences?

## The Childcare Crisis

Maryland has experienced dramatic losses in childcare capacity since the pandemic—a story with significant education and economic implications.

### What We Know:
- Maryland lost 15% of childcare providers and nearly 7% of slots between January 2020 and January 2024
- Some counties lost over 25% of providers (Caroline County: 25.97%)
- The number of top-rated facilities increased in some areas while overall capacity decreased
- Only Kent County saw an increase in childcare slots (12.83%)

### Coverage Gaps and Story Ideas:

**County-by-County Analysis:**
Each of the 24 Maryland counties has unique childcare challenges. The June 2024 series provides baseline data, but follow-up is needed:
- Which counties have recovered capacity, and how did they do it?
- **Story idea**: Compare two similar counties with different outcomes (e.g., Montgomery County with only 0.39% decrease in slots vs. Wicomico County with 16.59% decrease)

**The Unlicensed Care Problem:**
The Caroline County story mentions "unlicensed day care operations" emerging. **This deserves investigation:**
- How widespread is unlicensed childcare?
- What are the safety implications?
- Are parents knowingly using unlicensed care, and why?

**Economic Impact:**
- How does the childcare shortage affect workforce participation, particularly among women?
- What is the economic cost to Maryland of inadequate childcare?

## Student Mental Health: A Critical Issue

Mental health services in schools have become central to education policy, with significant funding allocated and then threatened.

### Recent Developments:

**Youth Mental Health Funding:**
- Maryland initially committed $110 million for mental health programs serving 58,000 students
- Governor Moore's budget crisis led to proposed cuts to $40 million
- The final amount was restored to $70 million (April 2024), but **it's unclear if this funding level is sustainable**
- Multiple counties received grants for mental health initiatives (February 2024 stories detail specific programs)

### Story Opportunities:

**Program Effectiveness:**
- The statewide youth mental health initiative launched recently enough that outcome data should be emerging. Request data from the Maryland Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports about:
  - Number of students served
  - Types of interventions
  - Any measurable outcomes
  
**School-Based Services:**
- Anne Arundel County's STAR program (June 2025) connects middle and high school students with substance abuse treatment. Has this model been adopted elsewhere?
- Behavioral health screenings like BIMAS-2 remain uncommon despite their potential (April 2025). Why are schools reluctant?

**The Social Worker Shortage:**
Howard University's Project PRESS is addressing school social worker shortages in D.C. (March 2025). What is Maryland doing about similar shortages?

## School Safety: Multiple Dimensions

School safety encompasses physical security, behavioral issues, and the school-to-prison pipeline.

### Current Issues:

**Cell Phone Policies:**
- Maryland schools are implementing varied approaches to cell phone restrictions (October 2024, June 2025)
- San Mateo High School (California) banned phones in 2019 with reported success
- **Story idea**: Compare outcomes at Maryland schools with different cell phone policies. Has reduced phone use improved mental health, academic performance, or social dynamics?

**Metal Detectors and Security:**
Prince George's County is one of only two Maryland public school systems with metal detectors in all high schools (October 2024). **This deserves follow-up:**
- What is the student experience like?
- Have metal detectors prevented incidents or just changed where they occur?
- What is the cost, both financial and psychological?

**Restorative Practices:**
Pocomoke High School in Worcester County achieved a 28% drop in violent incidents using restorative practices instead of traditional discipline (March 2025). **This is an underreported success story:**
- Which other schools are implementing restorative practices?
- What training do teachers receive?
- How do students and parents view this approach?

## Chronic Absenteeism: A Pandemic Hangover

Nearly 27% of Maryland students were chronically absent (missing 10%+ of school days) in 2023-2024—a post-pandemic surge that threatens academic recovery.

### Key Points:
- Chronic absenteeism impacts graduation rates and college enrollment
- Factors include unsafe school environments, frequent moves, family responsibilities, and health issues
- Some schools had chronic absenteeism rates above 40% (Baltimore City schools mentioned in February 2025 story)

### Investigation Opportunities:

**What Works:**
- Which schools or districts have successfully reduced chronic absenteeism post-pandemic?
- What interventions are most effective?

**The Transportation Factor:**
- Are bus driver shortages (mentioned in October 2021 Anne Arundel story) still contributing to absenteeism?
- How have schedule changes affected attendance?

**Hidden Populations:**
The story notes that family responsibilities often fall on older children. **This population deserves more attention:**
- How many students are caregiving for siblings or working to support families?
- What support exists for these students?

## Teacher Shortages and Compensation

Maryland faces persistent teacher shortages, with 28 subject areas lacking educators as of March 2024—up from 17 five years earlier.

### Recent Actions:
- Baltimore County approved a $76 million compensation package (September 2022)
- Montgomery County provided a 6% salary raise
- The Blueprint calls for significant increases in teacher pay

### Coverage Needs:

**Retention vs. Recruitment:**
Stories focus on shortages, but **why are teachers leaving?**
- What is the actual turnover rate by county and subject?
- Interview teachers who left the profession in the past year
- What would bring them back?

**Alternative Certification:**
- Maryland has various pathways to teaching. Which are most successful?
- How do alternatively certified teachers perform compared to traditionally certified ones?

**Teacher Diversity:**
The Blueprint emphasizes recruiting diverse teachers, but:
- What specific programs exist?
- How effective are they?
- What barriers persist?

## Higher Education Issues

### Student Debt and Financial Aid
Multiple stories address student loan forgiveness and financial aid complications:
- Public Service Loan Forgiveness program has high denial rates (September 2019)
- Maryland lawmakers introduced the FAFSA Fairness Act to help independent students (February 2019)
- **Story idea**: Track Maryland students through the loan forgiveness process. How many successfully receive forgiveness?

### College Affordability
- Community college tuition reduction bills have been proposed (February 2018)
- Foster youth tuition grants exist but have eligibility restrictions (January 2018)
- **Coverage gap**: What is the actual cost of attendance (including housing, food, books) at Maryland public universities, and how many students can afford it?

### Sports and NCAA Issues
- College athletes can now profit from name, image, and likeness (NIL)
- High school NIL is opposed by most states (May 2025)
- University of Maryland had significant controversy following Jordan McNair's death (2018)

## Special Populations

### English Language Learners
- Montgomery County and other jurisdictions have expanded language immersion programs
- The Blueprint requires additional support for multilingual learners
- **Story idea**: How do outcomes differ for students in different program models (immersion, ESL pull-out, etc.)?

### Students with Disabilities
- Special education is a Blueprint priority
- "Brynleigh's Act" proposed enhanced protections for students with seizures (January 2021)
- **Coverage need**: What is the current state of special education services? Are districts meeting IEP requirements?

### LGBTQ+ Students
- Montgomery County had controversy over LGBTQ+ book lessons (May 2025—**ongoing Supreme Court case**)
- Carroll County's transgender policies conflict with state guidelines (December 2024)
- Frederick County changed policies to support transgender students (October 2017)
- **Story idea**: What is daily school life like for LGBTQ+ students in different Maryland counties?

### Students in Foster Care or Juvenile Justice
- Education in juvenile facilities faces ongoing challenges (December 2017, October 2021)
- Foster youth have access to tuition grants but face barriers (January 2018)
- **Investigation opportunity**: Track outcomes for students transitioning from juvenile facilities back to traditional schools

## Technology and Digital Divide

### Broadband Access
A November 2020 story highlighted that 520,000 Maryland households lacked broadband access before the pandemic. The Digital Connectivity Act aimed to address this.
- **Caveat**: It's unclear how much progress has been made. This needs follow-up.
- Which counties still have significant gaps?
- How are schools handling students without reliable internet?

### Coding and Computer Science
- Governor Hogan launched the ACCESS initiative in November 2017 to promote computer science education
- A 2019 bill proposed allowing coding to count as foreign language credit
- **Story idea**: Which schools have implemented robust computer science programs, and how are students faring?

## Book Bans and Curriculum Controversies

### Current Landscape:
- Carroll County temporarily removed 56 books following complaints (October 2023)
- Maryland passed the "Freedom to Read Act" supporting librarians (April 2024)
- Anne Arundel County became Maryland's first "book sanctuary" (September 2024)

### Story Opportunities:

**The Impact on Librarians:**
- How have book challenges affected school librarians' jobs and morale?
- Are librarians self-censoring to avoid controversy?

**Student Access:**
- What books are students actually reading when given choices?
- Do removed books circulate more or less from public libraries?

**The Political Divide:**
School board races in 2022 and 2024 often centered on book access and curriculum content. **This will likely continue:**
- Track school board composition changes
- How do board decisions on books correlate with other education policies?

## School Board Elections and Governance

### 2022 Insights:
- Conservative candidates backed by the 1776 Project PAC won or led in 11 of 19 races (November 2024)
- At least 12 candidates had tax liens (November 2022)
- Major issues: learning loss, teacher shortages, school safety, book bans

### Coverage Recommendations:

**Beyond Elections:**
School board meetings often receive minimal coverage. **Consider regular beat coverage:**
- What issues consistently generate debate?
- How do individual board members vote?
- What happens in closed sessions?

**Financial Oversight:**
The "Contracted Out" investigation (August 2023) revealed significant issues with school district spending:
- Audits showed mismanagement and theft
- Some expenses remain mysterious (e.g., $694.1 million to "Electronic Funds Transf Program")
- **Ongoing need**: Monitor how districts implement audit recommendations

## Key People and Institutions

### State Level:
- **Governor Wes Moore** - Committed to Blueprint but facing budget constraints
- **State Superintendent** - Position overseeing education policy implementation

## Underreported Stories

Based on the coverage patterns, here are stories that need more attention:

1. **What happened to pandemic learning loss?** The 2022-2024 stories focus heavily on the problem, but where is the follow-up on recovery programs' effectiveness?

2. **The substitute teacher shortage** - Mentioned occasionally but never thoroughly examined

3. **School nutrition programs** - Beyond free lunch eligibility, how are schools ensuring food security?

4. **After-school programs** - What exists, who has access, and what difference does it make?

5. **School infrastructure beyond construction** - What about maintenance backlogs, aging systems, environmental issues?

6. **Transportation costs and challenges** - Bus driver shortages are mentioned, but what about routes, timing, and student impacts?

7. **Career and technical education (CTE) outcomes** - The Blueprint emphasizes CTE, but are graduates getting jobs in their fields?

8. **The private school landscape** - How have private and charter schools fared compared to public schools?

9. **Homeschooling trends** - A 53.6% increase during the pandemic (March 2022)—how many families stayed with homeschooling?

10. **Principal and administrator shortages** - Stories focus on teachers, but leadership pipeline also needs examination

## Tips for Covering Education

### Build Your Sources:
- **Teachers** - The frontline view is essential. Develop relationships with teachers across subject areas and experience levels.
- **Students** - Too often forgotten. They have the most direct experience.
- **Parents** - Represent diverse perspectives, not just the loudest voices at meetings.
- **Support staff** - Bus drivers, cafeteria workers, custodians, and paraprofessionals see things others miss.
- **Central office staff** - Understand bureaucracy and implementation challenges.

### Avoid Common Pitfalls:
- **Don't just cover controversies** - Positive innovations matter too
- **Go beyond test scores** - They're one measure, not the only measure
- **Consider timing** - Teachers are overwhelmed in August/September and May/June
- **Verify parent claims** - Even well-meaning parents sometimes misunderstand policies
- **Understand education jargon** - Learn what terms like "MTSS," "Title I," and "ESOL" actually mean

### Story Formats That Work:
- **Spending a day shadowing** - A student, teacher, or administrator
- **Comparative pieces** - How do different schools/districts handle the same issue?
- **Data analysis** - Patterns over time or across geography
- **Solutions journalism** - What's actually working somewhere?
- **Student voice pieces** - First-person accounts or profiles

## Looking Ahead

### Upcoming Decision Points:

**Budget Cycle** (Annual):
- Governor's budget proposal (usually January)
- Legislative session debates (January-April)
- County budget hearings (varies, usually spring)
- Final adoption (varies by jurisdiction)

**Blueprint Implementation:**
The 10-year Blueprint timeline means annual milestones. **Key dates to watch:**
- Pre-K expansion targets
- Teacher salary benchmarks
- College and career readiness goals
- Accountability Board reports

**Federal Changes:**
Any changes to federal education policy (ESSA, Title IX, special education laws) will affect Maryland. Stay current on Department of Education actions.

### Emerging Issues to Monitor:

1. **Artificial Intelligence in education** - How are schools using or restricting AI tools? (Mentioned in March 2023 story)

2. **Climate change and schools** - Both infrastructure (cooling/heating) and curriculum

3. **Post-pandemic enrollment shifts** - Which schools lost or gained students, and why?

4. **Teacher housing** - Some districts struggle to recruit because teachers can't afford local housing

5. **School consolidation** - Declining enrollment in some areas may force difficult decisions

## Final Thoughts

Education coverage requires patience, consistency, and genuine curiosity about how children learn and develop. The stakes are enormous—education shapes individual lives and society's future—but the daily work often seems mundane. Your job is to connect the bureaucratic decisions to real human impact.

Remember that almost everyone has opinions about schools based on their own experience, but education has changed significantly. Challenge your assumptions, question conventional wisdom, and always ask: **"How do we know that's true?"**

The best education stories show us not just what's happening in schools, but what kind of society we're building and what we value. Keep that bigger picture in mind even as you cover the details of school board meetings and budget debates.
