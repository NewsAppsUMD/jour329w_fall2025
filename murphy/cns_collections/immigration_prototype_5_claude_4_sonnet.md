## Important Context and Background

### Historical Perspective

### Demographics

- Top countries of origin: El Salvador, India, China, South Korea, Ethiopia
- Baltimore has accepted nearly half of Maryland's refugees since 2000
- Immigration has helped slow population decline in Baltimore and several rural counties

### Legal Landscape
Maryland generally has immigrant-friendly policies compared to other states, including in-state tuition for undocumented students and limited cooperation with federal enforcement. However, some counties actively cooperate with ICE.
