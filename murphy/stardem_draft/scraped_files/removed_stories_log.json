She was elected president of the board in December 2020 and held the role through 2022.Moving forward, Delean-Botkin said she hopes the Board of Education continues to maintain the county's high graduation rate and low dropout rate, expand its Career and Technical Education completer courses and implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a statewide plan to increase public education funding, improve student outcomes and improve the quality of public education.\"The other big thing that we're very proud of is having as many students as wish to go ahead and take the Advanced Placement classes and exams,\" Delean-Botkin said.At a July 19 Talbot County Board of Education meeting, President Emily Jackson said the board wishes Delean-Botkin the best of luck.\"We will miss her words of wisdom and her guidance,\" Jackson said.Talbot County Public Schools Executive Assistant Charlene Gould said in an email that the governor's office has been notified of the vacancy and will appoint a new board member to fill Delean-Botkin's seat until elections in November 2024.She said interested candidates can submit an application to the Governor's Appointments Office.In June, Commissioners Tom Costigan and Jimmy Jaramillo appointed Delean-Botkin to fill Commissioner Brian Wells' seat.Wells resigned at the June 27 Commissioners of Oxford meeting. He said he was resigning because he was moving to Easton.Before being appointed, Delean-Botkin ran against and lost to now Commissioner Katrina Greer. Greer took the seat of Jaramillo, who did not seek reelection.Delean-Botkin said her new role as Oxford commissioner is a \"challenging\" one.\"I think what we have to look at is, Oxford a town of about 600 folks,\" she said.\"Three sides are surrounded by water, so we have limits on growth. People tend to want to move to Oxford because of the quality of life.Majority of people that I talk to do not want to see many things change. They want to maintain the integrity of the town.\" \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY MAGGIE TROVATO\n \nSusan Delean-Botkin has resigned from the Talbot County Board of Education. \n \n Memo: \"The other big thing that we're very proud of is having as many students as wish to go ahead and take the Advanced Placement classes and exams.\" - Susan Delean-Botkin \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was later the academic and career adviser guiding students through actionable plans to achieve their goals.A native of Costa Rica, Solano came to the United States as a graduate student.After earning her bachelor's degree in Costa Rica, she worked for an international flower exporter as she continued her studies toward licensure at the University of Costa Rica.Her future plans took a turn when a professor at the university asked if she was adventurous.Thinking that the professor meant bungee jumping or some other daredevil sport, Solano prepared to decline. Instead, the professor asked if she would be interested in taking on a new academic challenge in a different country. He recommended her for a graduate research post at the University of Maryland.While working on \"green\" roof research and earning her master's degree in natural resources science at College Park, Solano's interest grew in building sustainable communities through policy and education.She went on to earn a Ph.D.in public policy and urban affairs at the University of Delaware.\"It's ironic that I studied urban affairs and ended up in a rural area,\" Solano said. \"Rural and urban areas face many of the same challenges, though, and people in both areas want the same things.\" Better lives and a greater sense of community, Solano said, are common desires for most people.The Cambridge Center provides both, she added. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED.\n \nLorelly Solano is the new director of the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And we just got off to a great start with him already knowing everyone here.\" Cenergistic created the energy conservation program that \"assists in minimizing the impact that cost increases has on the budget,\" according to the report. Four energy sources were considered: electricity, solar, heating oil and propane.The lion's share of cost increases was from electricity the school district buys from the grid at a 64% increase and heating oil with a 42% increase.\"There's not a whole lot we can do about the costs, so our company focuses on use and use reduction,\" Muir said.Relying on solar and setting back thermostats on weekends, nights and during the summer made a difference, Muir said.From July 2022 through June 2023, 80% of CCPS's utility spending was on electricity.\"That's a huge area of focus for Josh and our team,\" Muir said.However, even with the increases in energy costs, the public schools decreased energy use intensity (EUI) by 35%. Energy use intensity is a measure of 1,000 BTUs of energy per square foot, \"a benchmark that the EPA uses,\" Muir said. It's also used for Energy Star certification.\"It's a way of measuring elementary schools against other elementary schools, houses against houses, and the regional average here for K12 schools is 54 EUI,\" Muir said. \"When we started the program, you actually were doing pretty well; you were already at 50 EDI. And today, for the last 12 months, we're down to 32 EUI. So at that at that level, our company is going to be looking at getting certified for Energy Star for a lot of facilities.\" An \"energy savings day\" on Monday July 3, \"was a great little initiative and the results show,\" Muir said.Rein performed more than 1,516 building audits, \"and that equates to 1,451 metric tons of CO2 emissions avoided,\" Muir said. \"That's a huge environmental footprint.\" Muir compared the 1,451 metric tons of CO2, equating them to \"over 3.5 million miles driven by an average car,\" he said. \"That amount of energy can power 175 homes for the year.\" Cenergistic has a five-year contract with the Caroline County Public Schools.\"The message to the taxpayer is (our) more efficient use of money, and that's something you don't hear government say very often,\" Barton said.To view the full report, visit https://go.boarddocs.com/mabe/carps/Board.nsf/Public, open the Aug. 1 agenda and click on the \"Cenergistic Update\" link. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/TIMES RECORD\n \nCenergistic Client Manager Scott Muir shared a slide show depicting how the program has saved the school district over $250,000 since July 1, 2022 \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In the coming months, Cambridge residents are likely to meet Solano as she begins her community outreach efforts.The Cambridge Center, Solano said, is a resource for everyone in Dorchester County, playing a critical role in the economic and social health of the downtown area.In addition to credit classes in both transfer and career programs, the center also offers workforce training, personal enrichment opportunities and meeting spaces for community organizations. The center also houses the American Job Center.\"We're an education center for students of all ages, but I hope residents here also see us as a center of community growth,\" Solano said.Solano first joined Chesapeake as an English as a Second Language instructor.She was later the academic and career advisor guiding students through actionable plans to achieve their goals.A native of Costa Rica, Solano came to the United States as a graduate student.After earning her bachelor's degree in Costa Rica, she worked for an international flower exporter as she continued her studies toward licensure at the University of Costa Rica.Her future plans took a turn when a professor at UCR asked if she was adventurous.Thinking that the professor meant bungee jumping or some other daredevil sport, Solano prepared to decline. Instead, the professor asked if she would be interested in taking on a new academic challenge in a different country.He recommended her for a graduate research post at the University of Maryland.While working on \"green\" roof research and earning her master's degree in natural resources science at College Park, Solano's interest grew in building sustainable communities through policy and education.She went on to earn a Ph.D. in public policy and urban affairs at the University of Delaware.\"It's ironic that I studied urban affairs and ended up in rural area,\" Solano said. \"Rural and urban areas face many of the same challenges, though, and people in both areas want the same things.\" Better lives and a greater sense of community, Solano said, are common desires for most people. The Cambridge Center provides both, she added.For more information about the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center, please visit www.chesapeake.edu/cambridge. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nDr. Lorelly Solano is the new director of the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Board members asked questions about how the schools plan to track progress, address staffing vacancies and what things the board and community can do to help the schools reach their goals.Throughout the rest of the meeting, board members asked questions, initiated conversations and probed deeper about many of the meeting's agenda items.At the end of the meeting, board member Theresa Stafford gave her hopes for the school year.\"I hope that as we move forward as a board, the community does not have to guess where we are and where we're going,\" she said.\"This year we will be transparent in everything we do.\" Stafford said conversations are healthy and that hard conversations need to happen.\"One of the first things in moving forward,\" she said, \"(is) we have to be realistic.And we may not paint a rosy picture that everybody this year is going to sit here and smile and agree.\" Stafford said that, as board members, listening to the community and supporting teachers is vital.\"We are the voice of the people who elected us to make sure that we are doing the best we can for the kids we have and for the community that we serve,\" she said.Board member Chris Wheedleton said he's excited about making data-driven decisions this school year. He said there a plans for a new dashboard that will show whether progress on student outcomes is being made in the district.\"We're putting ourselves to account and making sure that we can really report where we're seeing progress,\" he said.Wheedleton also talked about the importance of having civil and constructive conversations as a board. He said that this can go handin-hand with data-driven decision making.\"I think that's an important message for our kids to hear as we go back into school as well - that civility and data can actually go together,\" he said. \"It's all about us looking at the data and then making really smart decisions about what we do.\" School Board President Susan Morgan said it's going to take collaboration to effect change.\"There's no reason that Dorchester County can't be the best county on the Eastern Shore for education,\" she said. \"To do that though, we need a little bit more help.We need help from parents, guardians, grandparents, anyone who has a child in our system.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nDorchester County Board of Education Member Theresa Stafford speaks during a Board of Education meeting Aug. 17 in Cambridge.\n \nMAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nDorchester County Board of Education Member Chris Wheedleton speaks during a Board of Education meeting Aug. 17 in Cambridge. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Open to students across the Shore, including Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot, working individually or in groups, Junior Division (grades six-eight) and Senior Division (grades nine-12) students select a topic related to an annual theme. Information on the competitive event is distributed to students by their history teachers.The 2024 NHD theme is \"Turning Points in History.\" There are five different types of projects that students complete: documentaries, exhibits, performances, and websites that can be done as a group or individually or papers that may only be done individually.Research is key, so the two teachers partnered with the public libraries in the participating Upper Shore counties of Queen Anne's, Kent, Talbot, and Cecil.\"Schools have limited research options,\" said Hayman, \"so we turned to the county libraries who have more resources.\" During the fall season, as students begin picking a theme and looking for information, the teachers make themselves available at libraries across the region on specific dates so that librarians and History Day staff can provide assistance with finding research options, accessing online databases, or browsing materials.Hayman said the students learn valuable skills \"like how to analyze information, to make sure sources are reliable, and to form their own opinion.\" Last weekend, Hayman and Anders visited Queen Anne's Library on Kent Island. Next up is the Talbot County Free Library in Easton on Oct. 21 from 9 a.m. 1 p.m.; Queen Anne's County Library in Centreville from 9 a.m. 1 p.m. on Nov. 4; and the Learning Resource Center at Chesapeake College on Nov. 12 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.The actual contest is March 23, 2024, at Chesapeake College. Judges from the Upper-Shore community include teachers, professors, and museum staff. Students who place are then able to participate in the state finals on May 4 at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.The hard work of Hayman and Anders has paid off. \"We saw that at the beginning the winners were always from the western shore,\" said Anders.\"Now we send more students to the state event than everyone but Baltimore County.\" Hayman said the program helps make history more real and interesting to students.\"You don't usually have students thrilled to be in history class,\" said Hayman. \"Students who participate sometimes find their true passion.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nThomas Hayman and Andy Anders, both history teachers at Centreville Middle School, visit Queen Anne's County Library Kent Island branch on their first stop helping students from the Upper Shore with their History Day project research. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Her first job in education was teaching at a middle school.Now, Howie is the curriculum supervisor of career and technical education for Dorchester County Public Schools as well as the interim principal at Mace's Lane Middle School.Monday, she was sworn in to the Board of Education after being appointed to the District 5 seat by Gov. Wes Moore. The appointment comes after the resignation of Susan Delean-Botkin, the previous District 5 board member.W hen she learned of the appointment, Howie told her husband first. He was so excited he switched a flight he had for a conference so he could watch her get sworn in on Monday.Howie herself was excited and honored.\"A little scared at the same time, because this is a huge undertaking and it's extremely important,\" she said.Howie talked about the importance of being able to support students' social and emotional and mental health, especially after COVID-19.\"Schools are safe places for a lot of our students,\" she said. \"If I'm hungry, if I'm angry, if I don't know where I'm going to go to sleep tonight, I can't learn.\" Social and emotional learning is one of the Board's priorities this school year. Its other priorities are increasing academic achievement and teacher retention.\"There are teacher shortages everywhere right now, and it's so important that we retain the teachers,\" she said.\"Because when you have to continually hire new teachers, there is that onboarding process and there is that learning curve.\" Joining the board, Howie is continuing her mother and grandfather's legacy in Talbot County Public Schools.When Howie was 18, her mother died from breast cancer. She remembers the funeral being \"packed\" with former students and teachers from the district.\"There are teachers in this school district that knew my mom when she was here and they come up to me all the time and they're like, 'Your mother would be so proud,'\" Howie said, tearing up.With two meetings under her belt so far - a work session on Monday and a regular meeting on Wednesday - Howie is feeling welcomed by her fellow board members.She appreciates the organization of the meetings.\"Everything went very smooth,\" she said.Although she's been on the board for less than a week, Howie has already been thinking about whether she will run for the position when her seat is up next year. She doesn't have an answer yet, though.\"I have definitely, definitely put a lot of thought into that,\" she said. \"This is such a wonderful opportunity.\" \n \n Caption: ANNA HOWIE \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hale and the class were excited to make this idea a reality.Since then, AMP cabinets with dartboard with darts included have been one of AMP's most popular products, selling out even before they were presented.Each time AMP students manufacture a product, they follow the same template.It begins with research, mood-boarding and a product pitch. With dartboards, students research the history, rules and professional leagues in the game of darts. Then each student must come up with a design for the project, followed by drafting their design and placing it on a Mood Board.This Mood Board becomes a visual they can refer to as they present their product pitch.Business partners, school officials, parents and former students are then invited to watch the students' product pitches Oct. 26.One by one, students manage the difficult task of individually pitching the details and merits of their designs to the class and guests in attendance.At the end of the presentations, everyone votes and a design is chosen.The next step in the process is called \"napkin sketching,\" which is a sketch of the product views and dimensions.These sketches are then taken to the computer aided drafting lab, where more accurate prints are made. From those prints, numeric commands are created that will drive a computer numeric control machine, which is a robot programmed to cut pieces out of stock material.Once complete, an audience is once again assembled for student presentations of the finished products, which are also offered for sale. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF CCPS\n \nAdvanced Manufacturing Program students at Caroline Career and Technology Center presented design ideas for their current project, a dartboard cabinet, on Oct. 26.

From military and law enforcement to county government and local businesses who are needing workers with specific skills, all were on hand to answer questions and discuss options for the future.One of the presenters was Connie Dean, the Career Technology Liaison for the Queen Anne's County Economic & Tourism Development department. Dean is assisting the two schools with finding businesses who are interested in the apprenticeship program.\"Students are first given skills that would be required to work in a certain business field,\" said Dean. Then the students work 450 hours at a partnering business to earn their official apprenticeship recognition.\"I try to tell businesses internships are a bigger commitment, when the apprenticeship program would be appropriate for future workers in their field,\" she said.Currently, there are three Kent Island students who were trained in the culinary department at Chesapeake College this semester.Aly Swann said she learned about the basics like cutting meat, how to work with knives and other kitchen tools, and how to make sauces. \"I know now 100% that this is what I want to do for a living,\" she said.James Smith said the school was really helpful in letting him work some during the school day. \"I appreciate that I got a pathway for my career. I have learned skills I will use for a long time,\" said Smith.Last Tuesday, was military and law enforcement day for the Queen Anne's apprentice week, with recruiters from all armed forces branches, answering questions about basic training, money for college, and traveling the globe.Troopers Christopher Bekefiand Doug Prince provided information on the Maryland State Police Cadet program, where students aged 17-19 are assigned to perform duties that do not require police authority (example helping with crowds at large public events). Cadets are also assigned to work under the supervision of a Trooper at a truck inspection station or on patrol.They also have an explorer program for students aged 14-18, where they are introduced to various divisions and tactics like crime scene investigations, traffic stops, and forensics.Adam Tolley, supervisor of Career and Technology Education for Queen Anne's Public Schools, was pleased to see so many students engaging with a variety of workforce representatives. \"This is a very organized way to provide students who are beginning to think about real career options,\" he said.County Commissioner Philip Dumenil was present to view the new apprentice week program first hand at Queen Anne's High School. \"I like new opportunities for exposure to these kind of programs,\" said Dumenil. \"Lots of money can still be made in the trade fields. Not every kid wants to go to college.\" Queen Anne's student Austin Hahn, just a sophomore, has already chosen a career for his future, and that, said Ricketts, makes him a perfect apprentice candidate.Hahn has chosen to pursue a career in marine mechanics and pipe welding and wishes to move to the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana or Texas where he has family. \"My grandfather taught me a lot about it,\" said Hahn. \"He said it would be the best money I could ever make. When he passed away, I knew I would definitely do it.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nNew Career Coach Betsy Ricketts stands beside the poster for Queen Anne's County High School's first apprenticeship week schedule. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We're fully aware that that's going to be a very big lift for us.\" Beachy said that for the two years following 2024, \"without another funding stream becoming available, we will drop back down to three elementary schools with a total of 400 students.\" In other business, the commissioners approved a $1,011,834 contract with Nashville-based Wellpath LLC to provide medical services for inmates at the county jail.Two surplus vehicles will be offered for sale, deemed by the County Commissioners to be \"no longer needed, outdated, unsafe, or (their) condition has deteriorated to the point that maintenance costs exceeds its practical value.\" A 2012 Dodge ambulance with 211,797 miles and a 2014 Dodge Ram with 218,742 miles will be auctioned locally.Ryan White has left his position as director of the Department of Public Works, and that position may be reconfigured before it is advertised.Commission Vice President Larry Porter expressed some concern about \"the scope of what is going to be able to be done by public works.\" \"At some point, in my opinion, (it's) going to have to be reduced. There's going to have to be more things contracted out,\" Porter said.Commission President Travis Breeding said, \"I've been giving this position a lot of thought, and I think it would be helpful to have someone there who is wellversed in the design process, permitting process, bid process.I almost feel like it's a two-person role.\" The next Caroline County Commission meeting will be held 9 a.m. Tuesday, Dec.5, in Room 106, Caroline County Courthouse, 109 Market St., Denton.Meetings are held 9 a.m.Tuesdays except the fifth Tuesday of the month, unless announced otherwise.

Fretterd Community Center.A number of Caroline County Public School sophomores had the opportunity to visit with representatives from a variety of businesses and attend workshops to help them explore career possibilities before they graduate from high school.Hosted by the Rotary Club of Denton, the 10th Grade Career Exploration Fair was sponsored by Smiles by Holsinger, Shore United Bank, Summit Community Bank and Sisk Fulfillment.The Denton Rotary has been providing this yearly event to 10th grade students since 2013; however, the COVID pandemic temporarily suspended it.\"The purpose of the event is to spark an interest and open up career possibilities to our 10th graders so they can be career ready when they graduate,\" said Sue Simmons, a Denton Rotarian and the event chair.This year was the highest attendance ever, with 97 students from Colonial Richardson High School, North County High School and the Caroline Career and Technology Center, who were split up into groups for the day. Nearly 30 small and large businesses set up vendor exhibits.Each group was assigned to a table with a business mentor - an adult to help match them with possible careers that are compatible with their interests or expose them to new ideas and opportunities to consider.Students were encouraged to explore careers that match their personal interests, such as working outside, being a problem solver, caring for others or owning their own business.Each student also attended two of the four workshops that were offered. Workshops included \"Unlocking Your Potential at Chesapeake College\" by Marci Leach, director of program development at Chesapeake Community College, and J.P. Kelly, business and industry navigator at Chesapeake Community College; \"Mental Health Means Inner Wealth\" by Sara Porter-Lepore, LCSW-C, and Cara Calloway, mental health coordinator for CCPS; \"How To Rock a Job Interview\" by Deborah Boulden, youth outreach coordinator for the Upper Shore Workforce Investment Board; and \"Way to Be: Exploring Career Interests\" by Abigail Trice, Next Generation Scholars coordinator for Caroline County.Participating students also had the opportunity to meet students from other schools, as each group was pre-assigned to their tables by Lindsey McCormick, CCPS director of college and career.Ten juniors who attended the fair last year returned as mentors to help guide the sophomores through the day.A bonus to the program was a special visit from Devon Beck, an NCHS graduate, songwriter, hip hop artist, podcaster and Talbot County Public Schools Equity Facilitator. Beck shared with the students his own story and provided a positive message about being true to themselves and finding a career that is meaningful to them.The Rotary Club of Denton thanked Dr. Derek Simmons, McCormick and Robert Gowen from the CCPS Board of Education; Eric Cook, Ann Ferkler, and Brad Plutschak from CCPS; as well as table mentors Danielle Forrest of Shore United, Linda Prochaska of Appleseed Books, Victor Reynolds of CASA of Caroline, Richard Warfield of the Caroline Review, Esther Curtis of SUN Behavioral Health), Desiree Jefferson and America McKinney of His Hope Ministries, Kristi English of APG Media Chesapeake, Angel Perez of the Caroline Culinary Arts Center, Kat Stork of Shore Strategies LLC, and Sarah Kilmon of Talbot County Communications. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF DENTON ROTARY\n \nCaroline County sophomore explore career options with local businesses and organizations Nov. 21. \n \n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

      "content": "Radcliffe Creek School awarded 'social-emotional' learning grant\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Local News \n \n 534\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Radcliffe Creek School (RCS) was recently awarded a grant from the Queen Anne's County Mental Health Committee (QACMHC) to expand its social-emotional learning curriculum. The new funding will broaden the robust curriculum already in place for younger students, bringing social-emotional resources to older students and their parents, as well as to the local community.Social-emotional skills serve as a guide for people to understand social situations and relationships: these abilities are central to navigating the world successfully in everyday life. Debbie Cohee-Wright, a special education learning specialist at RCS explained, \"If a child has a mental health issue of any kind, such as trauma, depression or anxiety, their ability to learn and access information is compromised. For a student to be available for learning, they must first feel emotionally safe. Making connections with teachers and peers and building trust with others must happen before the focus on academics can take place.\"\nCurrently, the school's social-emotional learning program encompasses two curriculums targeted to younger students who are identified as needing support to strengthen these skills. The program, administered by Intervention Transition Skills Coach Bryn Ponti, utilizes fun, engaging activities that integrate kid- friendly themes: kids imagine themselves as detectives who look for clues in their environment or as superheroes who earn superpowers, all while learning about executive functioning, perspective taking and self-regulation.\nHead of School Peter Thayer said, \"At RCS, we always try to meet students where they are in their learning, and here, that includes their social-emotional wellbeing. This grant from QACMHC will make a considerable difference in the lives of our older students and their families, many of whom are neurodivergent and need extra support in this area.\"\nThe funding provided by QACMHC will bring two additional curriculums\u2014Brain Talk and Conscious Discipline\u2014to the school, expanding its social-emotional programming to older students and their families.\nBrain Talk is a curriculum designed to teach students about the different areas of their brains, educating children about their executive function capabilities and how they impact responses to situations.\nConscious Discipline is a course designed for teachers, parents and guardians, providing adults with tools to show children better ways to self-regulate and build resilience.\n\"These grants are made possible by community support of our fundraisers and through generous donations from local businesses and individuals,\" QACMHC President Kelly Phipps said. \"We appreciate the outpouring of support whenever we have a fundraiser or ask for donations.\"\nIn addition to the new resources this grant will provide to Radcliffe Creek School's teachers, students and their families, the QACMHC grant will allow RCS to bring social-emotional programming to the local community as well. Planning is already underway to host an event for the public, bringing this important topic to local parents, teachers and residents in 2024. \"We are so grateful to QACMHC for their support of our school's social-emotional learning program. These funds will directly impact our students' mental health by supporting children both in the classroom and at home, leading to a more positive school environment, a greater sense of empowerment among our teachers and parents, and an increased sense of confidence in our children. We are excited to bring these resources to the Radcliffe Creek School community and beyond in 2024,\" remarked Director of Advancement Carolyn Thompson. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

      "content": "'Diving Deep' with dyslexia: Local special education teacher works to raise awareness\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TAMARA FORTE Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 1217\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE \u2014 What do Robin Williams, Jay Leno, Albert Einstein, Alexander Graham Bell, Magic Johnson, Jennifer Aniston, Gwen Stefani, Abraham Lincoln, and Arnold Schwarzenegger all have in common? They all have dyslexia.Lindsey Parte, a mother of two boys and Special Education teacher, has reignited the Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter that fizzled out during the Covid pandemic.\nParte shares that she has been \"diving deep into advocating and teaching herself (about dyslexia)\" for the last three years.\nWhen Parte's older son, Lincoln, was six years old, he struggled with both speech and reading. Parte said a red flag to her son's learning struggle was \"knowing how smart he was but not understanding why reading was so hard.\"\nParte explains that her two-year younger son was making gains on her older son. In contrast, reading was coming with ease to her younger son.\nOn the first day of second grade, Lincoln (her older son) came home and said, \"I can't do this. I can't read. I hate school.\" Lincoln was frustrated with learning and wanted to quit.\nIt was heartbreaking for Parte as a mother and as a special education teacher herself as no one wants to see their child struggle, especially with learning. Parte explained, reading is the gateway to learning and lifelong success, and as such, learning to read successfully is vital to all.\nTwo years after Parte first suspected Lincoln was dyslexic, Lincoln got his formal diagnosis. Parte explained that getting the diagnosis meant freedom for her and her son.\nShe recounts, \"I will never forget the utter sigh of relief when we told him he has dyslexia. It all made sense to him from that moment on. Within a week, he was already talking about it in class and advocating for himself. And most importantly, we got our boy back. His light turned back on.\"\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, dyslexia is \"a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). Also called a reading disability, dyslexia is a result of individual differences in areas of the brain that process language.\"\nAn MRI shows the physical differences in the brain composition of a dyslexic thinker versus a non-dyslexic thinker. Dyslexia is so common that one in five people are a dyslexic learners.\nWhat is it like to have dyslexia? How can I help and support a dyslexic learner? What are the early indicators of dyslexia? These questions and many others will be answered at 6:30 p.m., Feb. 20, at the \"Experience Dyslexia: A Dyslexia Simulation\" workshop at the Queen Anne's County Library Kent Island Branch location.\nThe free event, hosted by Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter, aims to raise dyslexia awareness, empower families to support their children, encourage educational interventions, and ultimately influence policy makers to support Maryland students with dyslexia.\nAll are welcome. The event will offer six stations to help understand the dyslexic learner: Learn to Read, Listen to Me, Write with Mirrors, Name the Letter, Write or Left, and Unfair Hearing Test.\nParte says,\"The two biggest takeaways I have learned over the last year of my deep dive into my son's brain and the way he learns are early identification is crucial (as young as five-years-old); and the dyslexic brain requires instruction to be explicit, systematic, cumulative and multisensory.\n\"It should integrate the teaching of listening, speaking, reading, spelling, vocabulary, fluency, handwriting and written expression. There should be an emphasis on the structure of language: phonology, orthography, morphology, syntax and semantics. Training teachers and educating parents is also of the utmost importance,\" she continued.\nSince then, Lincoln has helped his mom set up and lead workshops. In October, to celebrate Dyslexia Awareness Month, this mother and son duo led the Halloween-themed workshop entitled \"There is nothing scarier than not being able to read.\"\nParte believes in dyslexia awareness and education with her whole being, which is why she fundraised, on her own, to purchase the upcoming workshop materials.\nAfter more than three years of advocating, Parte promotes all adults to learn as much as they can by listening to podcasts, attending free trainings, reading books and fact sheets, and much more.\nMoving forward, what steps can we take?\n\"Release the stigma. Embrace the label,\" Parte said. \"The label means freedom. It gives a child the right to read. The right to appropriate instruction which in turns means success in reading and regaining self confidence. We got our child back the moment we told him he had dyslexia. The label opens a world of resources for your child to feel good about themselves. Priority is a child's mental and social wellbeing.\"\nDyslexic Learners have many strengths and show a lot of leadership skills. Some other positive skills of dyslexic learners include: problem-solving, big picture thinking, creativity, empathetic, and entrepreneurial skills.\nParte shared things parents can do to help their struggling reader if they suspect their child has dyslexia:\nTesting is everything. You will be surprised how relieved your child is with a \"diagnosis\".\nFinding the right intervention specialist (tutors in reading are not the same as someone trained and certified in structured reading interventions like Orton Gillingham). Tutoring at least three times a week is most effective. The key to remediation is \"go as fast as you can and as slow as you need to\". Early intervention is crucial especially to maintain your child's confidence in school.\nDeep dive in your own research. It will help with advocacy, ensuring the right assessments are being used, and knowing the right questions to vet organizations and other folks who claim to want to help your student.\nRead to your child not so they learn to read but so that they develop their reading comprehension and vocabulary while they are learning to read with appropriate interventions.\nIf your child receives the diagnosis of dyslexia, tell them, she encourages. Share all the amazing qualities a dyslexic thinker has and famous people who have dyslexia. Show them a photograph of a dyslexic brain vs typical brain.\nKnowledge and support in this process are so important. You don't have to go through this emotional journey alone. Connect with your local Decoding Dyslexia chapter.\nParte explains, \"Most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an important role.\nThough there's no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention result in the best outcome. Sometimes dyslexia goes undiagnosed for years and isn't recognized until adulthood, but it's never too late to seek help.\"\nCommunity support, awareness, education, and training will help all our learners learn in the best ways to be successful, happy learners. Together, we can impact our future and the future of our children. If you cannot attend the workshop at the library but are interested in gaining resources and learning more, you can email decodingdyslexiaES@gmail.com for more information and for a Welcome Newsletter with a list of more resources.\nCurrently, Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter is a grassroots movement (not a nonprofit), which means it has no funding and is paid for all out-of-pocket. It is run by parents who are also working professionals.\n\"The fight continues,\" Parte said, \"Until every single child (and their families) don't have to go through this hell and back to learn how to read.\"\nTo support and make a donation to Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter, you can also email Parte at the email above. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some of his doppelg\u00e4ngers even brought their own fake metal detectors \u2014 a hobby of Bailey's.\nAfter eight years teaching at DCTC, Bailey is hanging up his trowel and picking up his metal detector.\n\"You know, I love metal detecting, so I'll probably go find the Holy Grail or something,\" he said about what he will do in his retirement.\nWhen Bailey came in for his last day of teaching, right before winter break began, it took a little while for him to figure out what his coworkers had done.\n\"I'm like, 'Wait a minute, something don't look right,'\" he said. \"Then, when I saw the metal detectors, I was like, 'Ohh, they got me good!'\"\nDCTC Principal Ashley Robinson came up with the idea.\n\"I was just trying to really think about how we could celebrate his time here in a way that he would enjoy and that he would feel appreciated,\" she said. \"So I really thought the best way to do that would be with humor, since that's something he really enjoys.\"\nIn order to keep it a surprise, Robinson said she made it a part of the school's holiday spirit week.\n\"So he thought everyone was just dressing in comfy sweatshirts,\" she said. \"And I let everyone else know we were really just dressing like Mr. Bailey.\"\nBailey, who was surprised by his coworkers' plan, thought it was funny.\n\"It was so great because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said. \"I would have never expected that.\"\nBailey said he knew Robinson had something to do with it.\n\"She comes up with such cool stuff,\" he said, adding that she gave him a plaque with a trowel on it to commemorate his time teaching at DCTC.\nHe said there's a reason he would wear the similar outfit that his coworkers knew so well to work everyday.\n\"Working in the masonry, you can't really go in there with real good clothes on,\" he said. \"You gotta wear your oldest stuff. Like, inside my car, all you see is dust.\"\nRobinson said Bailey, like the rest of DCTC's staff members, epitomizes the importance of CTE education.\n\"The majority of the teachers here have worked in industry in their field, they have those life experiences and then they chose to come back and give back and work with kids to set them up to be successful,\" she said. \"We were happy to have (Bailey) and happy that he was able to do this.\"\nBailey has had a few different careers over the years. He owned a masonry business, was a prison guard and spent four years in the Marine Corps. But teaching is in Bailey's blood. His father taught at James M. Bennett High School in Salisbury.\n\"He was football coach, track coach,\" Bailey said. \"And we lived right across the street from Bennett, so I was at school every day. I knew it from top to bottom.\"\nHe has memories of cigarette smoke \"flying out of the teachers' lounge\" and teachers coming over to his family's house to play cards with his father.\n\"I mean, that was the good old days,\" he said.\nLooking toward his retirement, Bailey has plans to further explore the hobby his DCTC coworkers know he loves.\nBailey said the Career and Technology Center staff knew about his metal detecting because he would send them photos of some of his finds.\nOver the last five years, Bailey said he has gotten more and more into metal detecting. His neighbors, known as The Hoover Boys on YouTube, post metal detecting videos. They have over 100,000 YouTube subscribers. When they moved next door, Bailey said they started giving him their hand-me-downs.\nOver the years, Bailey has found all sorts of things \u2014 from shoe buckle frames to Civil War bullets to cannonballs. Two of his major finds were a rare George Washington inaugural button and a pine tree shilling.\nAlthough he has plans to do more detecting, Bailey said he'll miss his students.\n\"A lot of them played sports, and I'd hook them up with a sub,\" he said. \"It was always a sub, a red Gatorade, orange Doritos.\"\nAs he moves on to his next chapter, Bailey now has fond memories of his own teaching experience to look back on.\n\"Oh I loved it,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

      "content": "School board adopts 2024-2025 calendar\n\n February 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: Local News \n \n 743\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 Caroline County students will be heading back to school before Labor Day this year.Offered two alternatives \u2014 a pre- or post-Labor Day start \u2014 the five-member Board of Education voted unanimously Feb. 6 to approve the pre-Labor Day calendar for the 2024-2025 school year.\nEnglish, Spanish and Haitian Creole translations of the calendar are posted on the Caroline County Public Schools website.\nThe school year start date is Wednesday, Aug. 28.\nCCPS Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons presented the two calendars, along with results of a survey distributed to parents, teachers and staff.\nWhile the current school year calendar began after Labor Day, the school board considered factors that mitigated against the later start, including the presidential election day, which necessitates closing schools Tuesday, Nov. 5, and Christmas falling on a Wednesday.\nFall sports practices will begin Aug. 14. Winter break will begin Dec. 20.\nThe calendar committee emailed a link to the survey Jan. 12 to over 5,400 parents, guardians and all CCPS staff members. A reminder email was sent Jan. 22, and the survey was closed Jan. 26. Some community members provided feedback, as well.\nAlthough 75% of the 3,500 parents and guardians who responded favored a post-Labor Day start, 696 staff respondents, or 70% preferred a pre-Labor Day start.\nBefore reviewing the feedback, Simmons cautioned the school board, saying, \"No matter what decision you make, you're going to make people upset, period. There is no perfect calendar, period.\"\nBoard member and retired Caroline County teacher Donna DiGiacomo favored the earlier start.\n\"So, one calendar starts Aug 28; the other starts Sept. 3, but the end date is just one day difference,\" DiGiacomo said. The adopted calendar gets \"students in a routine quicker, and you have a shorter week when you start \u2014 you have three days, so everybody's not dead by Friday.\"\nShe said a 4-day first day of school \"doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a lot.\"\nWinter break begins with a half-day Friday, Dec. 20, and students returning to school Jan. 7.\n\"A hard shutdown over winter break for two solid weeks\" would result in reduced heating costs and \"significant savings\" during \"the hardest budget year we're going to have,\" Simmons said.\nThe post-Labor Day calendar would have had students returning Thursday, Jan. 2, 2025.\n\"This might not be a popular thing to say, but the reality is not a whole lot is going to get done on that Thursday and Friday,\" DiGiacomo said.\nOther factors influencing the pre-Labor Day start were academic quarter dates and required parent-teacher conferences, which \"we talked about ad nauseum,\" Simmons said.\nCalling the process \"wonky\" and comparing it to a game of dominoes, Simmons explained the factors that prompted the calendar committee to go through \"seven or eight drafts to get down to the two that made the most sense.\"\nFor example, the first quarter parent-teacher conference day will occur Nov. 5, even though it's election day, because the first quarter ends Nov. 8 and the conference day \"has to fall before the first report card goes out, before grades are secured,\" Simmons said.\nThe adopted calendar has four inclement weather days built in. If they are not used, they come off the calendar.\nState law, teacher contracts, mandatory conferences, state testing days, a set number of half-days, a mid-year transition day all dictate certain days off. Once all of the days off are built in, \"it becomes a game of counting to 90 twice\" to achieve a state-mandated 180-day school year, Simmons said.\nDiGiacomo recommended surveying students next year and considering staggered starts for sixth grade and ninth grade students as they change schools.\n\"The pluses of draft two are just not as many as the pluses in draft one,\" said Rick Barton, president of the school board.\nAlthough he liked \"the idea of a longer break,\" school board Vice President Mark Jones was ambivalent.\n\"I honestly don't like either one of them, really,\" he said.\nThat ambivalence was reflected in the overall survey results, with 54% of all respondents preferring a post-Labor Day start and 46% going with the pre-Labor Day calendar.\nAnticipating mixed reactions from the public and staff as well, Jones asked, \"When do we want to hear complaints? Do we want to hear them right before the first day of school, or do we want to hear them after Christmas break? I think I'd probably rather hear them at the beginning of the year and get it out of the way.\"\nTo view the 2024-2025 CCPS school year calendar, visit www.carolineschools.org/page/ccps-school-calendar.

Schools participating in this year's event represented Caroline, Cecil, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties. This year's theme was Turning Points in History.\nProjects entered this year covered a wide range of topics, as students used a lot of creativity to make their cases.\nTopics covered included pop-culture history, topics related to women's rights and the Great Depression, as well as improvement in technology and even the advent of fast-food and its impact on history.\nThe students work hard to get to this level of the competition by first competing at the local level within their home school. The next step is this regional event, with the winners invited to participate in the Maryland statewide competition.\nAt each level, judges provide feedback the students can use to improve their project for the next competition.\nHayman says the event started as an after-school program he became involved in when he first began his teaching career. As the number of students grew, and the national event began to take shape, local programs also grew.\nEastern Shore counties previously had individual county-level events, but they decided to form a coalition in 2017 in order to be more competitive at the state level.\nThe plan worked \u2014 Hayman reports in the five years the Upper Shore Regional event has been held, two area students have gone on to compete in the national event.\nThe regional event sends the top two from each category, from each county to the state event. The state only sends the top two in each category to the national event.\nThe event is offered in conjunction with National History Day and Maryland Humanities, and it is intended to help foster a love of history in the students who participate. Students submit projects in five categories: Paper (Individual), Website, Performance, Documentary and Exhibit.\nThey can submit content as either individuals or in groups of up to five students. There are now three divisions \u2014 a youth division for students in the fifth grade, the Junior Division for students of grades six to eight and the Senior Division for students grades nine to 12.\nThe regional event is funded by Maryland Humanities, which is also responsible for hosting the state event. Hayman said Chesapeake College also played a vital role, donating the space for the exhibits, presentations and performances free of charge \u2014 a location providing a more central location than previous venues. Food trucks rounded out the day's festivities for the students.\nThese students make a choice to put in extra hours to work on their projects outside of their normal school work, Hayman said. Many of the students who participate, come back multiple years to compete, each year improving their research and presentation skills. The amount of effort and dedication these projects require rivals similar science contests.\nWhile not all participants went home with an award, the judges handed out over 50 awards to the students, including: Sports History Award, Heritage Award, Natural History Award, Military History Award, Contemporary World History Award, African American History Award, Colonial History Award, Equality in History Award, Medical History Award, and the Chesapeake Bay/Maritime Award. First, second and third place finishes as well as Best in Region awards were also given in each category. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One by one, students were moved throughout the kitchen and shown the behind-the-scenes of sweet treats and rich desserts.\nJulia Foxwell, director of community engagement for Bluepoint Hospitality, said it was a delight for the chefs to share their passion for sweets with the students.\n\"We have been working with the Chesapeake Multicultural Center for some time on how best to support their initiatives while also providing enriching experiences to their students,\" Foxwell said. \"Bringing the girls and boys in to learn kitchen basics \u2014 from prep to final product \u2014 exposes them to new concepts, flavors and perhaps a future passion of their own. Chefs (Harley) Peet and Heim loved hosting the kids in the kitchen and even got a few ideas for new flavors.\"\nVictoria Gomez Lozano, Hispanic outreach coordinator for Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said this program is important in reaching out to community members who may not know about the center's services.\n\"We started this program to give the underserved children of this community the opportunity to have extracurricular activities and to be exposed to a lot of things that they may not have the opportunity to,\" Gomez Lozano said. \"It's also a good way to contact their parents and the families in the community as well so they can open up to us and so we can give them our services.\"\nAt the end of the tour, every student was given a scoop of ice cream and a choice of toppings to create their own flavor.\nEach student enjoyed the ice cream while laughing with friends.\nStudent Yerelin Fuentes said she has been in the after-school program for a few years now and loves the chance to learn new things and spend time with her friends outside of class. But what she loves most, she said, is the ability to learn to be a good person.\n\"They show us how to be a hero,\" Fuentes said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

      "date": "2024-05-08",
      "author": "Aidan Hughes and Daranee Balachandar Capital News Service",
      "content": "Will plan for better pay ease teacher shortage?\n\n May 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AIDAN HUGHES and DARANEE BALACHANDAR Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 911\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fifth-grade teacher Melissa Carpenter works a 10-hour day on average during the week, and her job sometimes requires her to put in hours on weekends, too.\"I feel like teaching is one of those jobs where we go to work to do more work \u2014 to do work after work,\" said Carpenter, who teaches at William B. Wade Elementary School in Waldorf in Charles County.\nCarpenter's long hours are far from unique among Maryland's educators, as the state and nation grapple with a teacher shortage.\nThe U.S. Department of Education keeps a Teacher Shortage Areas database \u2014 and it found that for the current school year, Maryland was short of teachers in 28 subjects, which the state defines as \"areas of certification.\" That's up from 17 five years earlier. Some teacher certification areas \u2014 such as English as a second language, health science and special education \u2014 are short on teachers from pre-K through the 12th grade.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future \u2013 a landmark state law reforming public education \u2014 aims to fix that problem by \"elevating the stature of the teaching profession\" through higher pay, better training and stronger recruitment efforts.\nHowever, experts and educators have mixed views about whether that will successfully address the root causes of the shortage.\n\"Money is a huge help, but it's not everything,\" said Simon Birenbaum, director of grading, assessment and scheduling at Baltimore City Public Schools. \"Human capital is the biggest issue, and money can help with that problem, but recruiting, training and retaining high-quality teachers and staff has to be the primary focus. No amount of money can compensate for a lack of highly-skilled educators.\"\nDOCUMENTING THE SHORTAGE\nMaryland's teacher woes follow national trends. The National Center for Education Statistics reported 86% of U.S. K-12 public schools faced challenges in hiring teachers for the current school year.\nAmid the shortage, the Blueprint calls for hiring an unspecified number of additional teachers to ease the workload of classroom veterans.\n\"You hear a lot about the teacher shortage \u2014 and how are we going to implement all these Blueprint programs, which require additional staffing, when we have a teacher shortage?\" asked Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\nShortages stem, in part, from the fact that teachers are leaving the profession. In Prince George's County, 1,126 teachers resigned between July 2022 and July 2023 \u2014 up from 989 the previous year, The Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, 625 resigned in Montgomery County Public Schools, up from 576 a year earlier.\nDorchester County experienced the highest attrition rate in Maryland during the 2021-22 school year at 18%, according to a Department of Education report.\n\"I used to never have people just quit in the middle of the year,\" said Dorchester County Superintendent Dave Bromwell, who recently retired. \"The pandemic told some people, you know what? If you're not happy, move on.\"\nAll those factors end up impacting teachers like Carpenter. She said her grade level saw an influx of students, with around 30 students in her own fifth grade class this year.\n\"Our class sizes are growing, and we don't have the support in place to help some of our struggling learners,\" she said.\nBLUEPRINT PAY BUMP\nIn order to address the teacher shortage, the Blueprint provides a number of measures that lawmakers hope will encourage people to become teachers and ensure that existing ones don't leave for more lucrative out-of-state positions \u2013 or exit the profession altogether.\nA key Blueprint initiative increases teacher pay to a minimum of $60,000 by 2026. In some counties, that means a nearly $15,000 pay bump for new teachers.\nDavid Larner, chief human resource and professional development officer at the Howard County Public School System, said the pay raise will attract teachers from other states and build up Maryland's teacher workforce.\n\"If our salaries are higher than salaries in surrounding states \u2026 then candidates are more likely to come,\" Larner said.\nHowever, Hansen, of the Brookings Institution, expressed skepticism about the likely impact of the measure on the state's teacher shortage.\nHansen argued that rather than a universal rise in minimum salary levels, money should be targeted where it's needed the most \u2013 attracting teacher talent in high-need schools and specialized fields like STEM subjects and special education. He also highlighted research that suggests salary is just one of many factors that can lead to teacher attrition.\n\"I think we need to be paying teachers more \u2013 I don't think paying a $60,000 minimum wage is the way to do it,\" he said.\nWORK IN PROGRESS\nBeyond the Blueprint, the General Assembly last year passed the Maryland Educator Shortage Reduction Act, which requires the state to set recruitment goals for teacher education programs, creates an alternative teacher prep program for early childhood educators and establishes a $20,000 yearly stipend for eligible student teachers.\nGov. Wes Moore, who proposed the legislation, said upon signing it that it is intended to place \"world-class teachers in every classroom.\"\nCarpenter, the Charles County teacher, said future changes may be necessary, too.\n\"We will have new students next year, and they will [have] different needs. So we need to make sure that we are constantly evolving,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Sparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George's County, stressed that reinforcing the teacher workforce is key to the Blueprint's overall success.\n\"It lands in the hands of our educators, and if we don't have educators who are highly qualified or able to do the work, then the Blueprint work would never get accomplished,\" she said.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Sodexo contract was set to expire on June 30 and QACPS is now joining 22 other school systems that run in-house food-service programs in their districts.\nAs of July 2024, QACPS food services will be self-operational and no longer operated by Sodexo as a food service management company. In order to be self operational, a vendor contract is needed to provide the necessary food and items which is currently being procured through the district's food service management company, according to Hickey.\nThe district looks to save money in aspects such as management, by going self operational, she said, and will be joining forces with MSEC to join in a contract with Sysco.\nCaroline County put forth a bid for food and food related items and Sysco was the only bid received, Hickey said.\nThe MSEC contract contains a clause for Queen Anne's to partner and utilize the services. The contract was recently renewed for the third year to begin July 2024 with two more years of renewal options, she said.\nThe total estimated cost for FY25 is $800,000 and will utilize the food service balance account, according to Hickey.\nFood service department staff have been notified of the district's conversion to self-operational and have been given the opportunity to ask questions.\n\"No hourly positions are being cut and they are all encouraged to reapply when the positions become available, \" Hickey said.\nBoard member Richard Smith noted, \"I was back in the day when we had it in-house, then we went out, now we're back in.\"\nWhile the operational budget may not look different within the first year, Hickey emphasized, \"What we're doing is keeping that money in the county, and being able to prioritize and utilize local vendors which it cannot do right now,\" she said. By October, the district hopes to have a partnership with a local vendor in time for Homegrown School Week.\nIn addition to the cost savings, Board President Helen Bennet was particularly excited about the prospect of partnering with local farms, particularly for the benefit of FFA, and looked forward to updates as it moved forward.\nThe board's approval of the contract was necessary as the district needs to begin ordering food for summer programs and the start of next school year, Hickey said.\nIt was also noted, as the district shifts away from its current food service management company Sodexo, so too does its milk distributor service contract and the BOE approved piggybacking off of the MSEC milk contract with Cloverland Dairy.\nCloverland is QACPS's current milk provider through the Sodexo, so the approval just brings a different contract, Hickey said.\nPricing on half pints of regular milk are estimated to be better with the piggybacking contract, Hickey said.\nWicomico County Public Schools put the public bid out for milk delivery and the contract contains a piggyback clause for QACPS to jump on, she said.\nThe total price is expected to be $190,000 for the Fiscal Year 2025 and funding will come from the food service funding account, according to Hickey.\nAn established milk vendor is required as part of compliance with the national school lunch and breakfast programs and federal guidelines, she said.\nThe contract is in effect until June 2026 unless terminated early by Wicomico, which is unlikely, Hickey noted, as Clover Farm is one of the only dairies in the area that has K-12 compliant milk products and has been that way for some time.\nThe board will next meet June 5. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat.

      "content": "Nearly 300 Chesapeake College students celebrate graduation\n\n May 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 691\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS \u2014 Nearly 300 Chesapeake College students were cheered by friends and family as they received their diplomas on Wednesday during the spring graduation.Clifford Coppersmith, president of Chesapeake College, congratulated the graduates for their achievements in furthering their education. Coopersmith recounted his journey as a community college graduate over 40 years ago.\nIn his speech, he referenced two themes he wanted to share with the graduates: the first acknowledges the extraordinary times they are living through, and the second theme is the hope that the graduates embody.\n\"I wish to focus on all of you, our first cohort of students graduating with degrees and certificates that were impacted the most by the immediate and following effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Coppersmith said. \"You have persevered in the most difficult times we have seen as a nation in decades, and your decision to pursue your education, to quote a colleague of mine, Dr. David Harper, is a sign of hope, in and of itself.\"\nAn array of individuals were honored, including Rob Thompson, current director of arts for Chesapeake College, who received the 2024-2026 Bounds Distinguished Teaching Chair Award.\nIn Thompson's speech, he spoke of Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for president in 1872, and her dedication to her dream for a more equal society. He described her as a pioneer for women's rights.\n\"Woodhull never asked for permission to try and change the world or to embark on any of the careers she took up,\" Thompson said. \"She felt an injustice, she found a purpose, and she took action in as many ways as she could think of. For as long as she could stand, it would all be a national figure. But as her story shows, she was just as focused on changing conditions in her home as she was on the nation.\"\nThompson described the importance of shaping homes and communities and the power that adapting after failure has on people.\n\"That's not so much persisting as it is adapting and seeking an alternative,\" Thompson said. \"Chasing dreams requires that you travel down some dark and twisting trails. But you've got to keep searching. My student's dreams and their remarkable capacity to show up with creative minds and passionate hearts have carried me through this career. I'm talking about you guys.\"\nAfter Thompson's speech, Milton Nagel, vice chair of the Chesapeake College Board of Trustees, presented the John T. Harrison Award to Zulema Delacruz Martinez. The John T. Harrison Award is given each year to a student who has demonstrated the highest academic performance, leadership and overall contributions to the college and the community.\nDelacruz Martinez was praised for her commitment to Hispanic and Latino students within the region who are interested in college but may be intimidated by the academic process. She has organized several events to welcome the students and their families to complete college applications and sign up for resource services.\nDuring her speech, Delacruz Martinez recounted her childhood growing up in a nontraditional home and witnessing the extraordinary hard work that her mother had to do to provide for her and her brother.\n\"My mother overcame so many obstacles while making so many sacrifices. It was then, at the age of 8, that I vowed to do the same. I decided I would learn from her experience of having a front-row seat to my mother's hardships as she overcame her adversities. All of those experiences have pushed me to persevere.\"\nShe recounted the resources her advisers gave her and the many people who helped guide and support her to finish. During her time at Chesapeake College, she founded the Hispanic Latino Student Union, learned to be a leader and found her home there.\nToward the end of her speech, Delacruz Martinez praised her classmates and offered words of encouragement.\n\"Take advantage of every opportunity that comes your way. Build upon meaningful relationships with those around you and keep persevering as you keep persevering. Whether that be in your future college endeavors or in your day-to-day lives,\" Delacruz Martinez said. \"I leave you with this quote: 'To make a great dream a reality. The first requirement is a great capacity to dream. The second is persistence.'\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This includes prepayments and covering for anticipated overages.\nJones asked for approval to transfer $75,000 to student services, in part for prepayments on software, and $500,000 to transportation to prepay upcoming bus lease payments.\nThe district also asked to transfer $600,000 to fixed charges for other postemployment benefits contributions and health insurance prepayments.\n\"We're just trying to make headway there because we're very far behind on that liability,\" Jones said of the benefits payments.\nTo balance the budget, Jones requested that savings from three categories \u2014 instructional salaries, special education and interfund transfer to capital projects \u2014 be used to transfer the funds. Notably, there was $850,000 saved in instructional salaries.\n\"Whenever we're transferring out of instructional salaries, it always raises an eyebrow,\" Council Vice President Pete Lesher said. \"Because of course that savings comes from vacant positions.\"\n\" \u2026 I'm curious what the plan is to fill those positions for the coming years so that we don't see that loss in direct student contact,\" Lesher said.\nJones said the district has a director of recruitment and retention. She also mentioned that having mentors for teachers has been \"very helpful for retention of newly-hired staff.\"\n\"I think a little bit of the savings are a reflection of us having grant availability this year,\" Jones added. \" \u2026 If money frees up in a grant and it's appropriate to charge a teacher or part of a teacher salary, we're going to use that money.\"\n\"It's comforting to know that you're being intentional about ensuring that those positions will get filled,\" Lesher said. \" \u2026 The success of the schools is one of our most powerful economic development tools. When the schools succeed, it helps all the other businesses, everybody else who's looking to hire in this community.\"\nThe council approved the request unanimously. \n\n Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore to fill a vacancy on Talbot County's Board of Education.She was sworn in at the Talbot County Education Center during the Board of Education's meeting on Wednesday. Strawberry, who resides in Easton and has two children in the school district, said she's \"grateful\" and \"honored\" to serve on the board.\n\"It is fitting for me to be able to have direct knowledge and access to policies, procedures, strategic planning and programs that could be significant for the education of our students,\" Strawberry said.\nStrawberry was appointed to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Jymil Thompson from the District 1 seat. Thompson resigned from his position after being named the interim superintendent of Dorchester County Public Schools earlier this year. In June, he was selected by the Dorchester County Board of Education to remain in the superintendent role.\nStrawberry expressed three areas she hopes to focus on as she assumes a seat on the board.\n\"One is safety amongst the students in all of the schools,\" she said. \"Secondly would be sufficient and adequate staffing for our children to be able to succeed in their learning. And thirdly is preparing our community, our neighbors and families of our students to be equipped to support their children educationally as they attend school.\"\nStrawberry is a dedicated healthcare professional with over 15 years of experience in patient care, nursing leadership and nursing education, according to a press release from Talbot County Public Schools.\nShe holds a Bachelor of Science in nursing from Hampton University; a Master of Science in nursing, adult and community health from Wesley College; and a post-masters certificate in nurse leadership from Wilmington University.\nIn addition to her work in nursing leadership, Strawberry is an adjunct professor and mentor for nursing students at the University of Maryland Global Campus. She is an entrepreneur, managing independent businesses as a delegating nurse and as a real estate investor.\nShe is a member of the American and Maryland Nurses Associations and has served on committees, performed research and delivered presentations focused on a broad range of health care initiatives.\n\"I am committed to leveraging my expertise and professional experience to enhance the educational landscape of Talbot County and to ensuring a bright future for all students,\" Strawberry said in the press release. She will serve until a successor is elected during the next congressional election in 2026. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

      "content": "Maryland school board candidates push for officers, mental health services\n\n October 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Emily R. Condon and Max Schaeffer Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1315\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In Montgomery County, school board candidate Brenda M. Diaz worries that \"knife-wielding vandals\" have easy access to schools because the district removed the police officers that are on hand in the rest of Maryland's public school districts to try to keep the peace.Across the state on the Eastern Shore, school board candidate Karla Wieland-Cherry of Talbot County told the Local News Network in a candidate survey that teachers feel threatened by some of their students.\nAnd in Howard County, school board candidate Andrea Chamblee \u2014 whose husband, John McNamara, was shot to death in the 2018 mass shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis \u2014 said the threat of a school shooting is just one of the stressors looming over the county's children.\n\"Bullying, mental health struggles, technology addiction, unreliable transportation, larger class sizes, fewer fine art enrichment opportunities, portable classrooms, overcrowding, poorly maintained buildings, food insecurity, poor indoor air quality and bigotry are all eroding the well-being of our students and staff,\" Chamblee said. \"Students who aren't well, can't learn well. In order to focus on academics, we must take on these safety challenges and provide students and staff with a stable learning environment.\"\nConcern about school safety in Maryland spans the state \u2014 which is why candidates in Maryland's school district races are stressing the issue. Of the 74 candidates who replied to a Local News Network questionnaire, 48 said they were not entirely satisfied with school safety in their district. Many called for adding more law enforcement officers as well as mental health counselors to their local schools.\nDiaz advocates returning school resource officers to Montgomery County schools \u2014 but statistics, and the comments of school board candidates statewide, make clear that school safety and student behavior aren't easily controlled just by in-school cops.\nSchool safety at a glanceThe school safety problem is a national one. Violent incidents increased 49% in the nation's schools the 2023-2024 school year, according to the Educator's School Safety Network.\nMaryland has not yet released its 2023-2024 statistics, but in the 2022-2023 school year, the number of anonymously reported bullying or cyberbullying incidents rose over the prior year from 91 to 107 , according to the Maryland Center for School Safety. The number of assaults and threats to cause harm increased from 83 to 98. And the number of general school safety complaints shot up from 62 to 104.\nThe school safety center also tracks critical life threatening incidents, which are defined as incidents that cause death or serious injury, or acts of mass violence under law. These incidents for the past three school years totaled 17, 18 and 18.\nAmong those incidents are the following:\nOn Oct. 27, 2023, at a Baltimore City high school, a student worked in tandem with both of his parents to assault and shoot three other students.In April 2024, Montgomery County Police arrested a high school senior who had written a 129-page manifesto on his plans for a school shooting.In January 2024, a high school student was arrested after threatening mass violence and arson at the school, the Somerset County Sheriff's Office said. The student had previously been caught with a gun at school, according to a county press release.\nSchool board candidate Matthew Warren Lankford, whose son was in the school at the time of that last incident, said that student is now back in school. \"This student needs special attention and should never be allowed back in the school as a normal student again,\" Lankford said.\nSchool resource officers\nSchool resource officers, the official name for trained officers in schools under Maryland's 2019 Safe to Learn Act, are posted in some schools in every Maryland jurisdiction except Montgomery County. And many school board candidates expressed support for hiring more school resource officers.\n\"I am satisfied with the safety for the big, catastrophic-type events,\" said Jaime Brennan, a Frederick County school board candidate. \"But I am not satisfied with the daily acts of violence\u2026that occur. I think that expanding the school resource officer program so that we have a designated SRO in each middle and high school would help.\"\nThe Maryland Center for School Safety is responsible for training school resource officers in the state and reports each year on their coverage in schools. The overall number of schools with a full-time officer on hand increased from 273 in 2021-2022 to 288 in the 2022-2023 school year.\nIn Calvert County, another candidate who is running for reelection, Antoine White, said he meets regularly with his board's safety liaison and local sheriff's department. White voted to increase the number of school resource officers in his district.\nBut another candidate in Calvert County, Paul Harrison, said he is not content with the lack of armed officers in six schools and pledged to try to fill those gaps.\nIn contrast, Montgomery County ended its school resource officer program in 2021 amid concerns that students of color were being disproportionately disciplined. The district now has a community engagement officer program, in which officers patrol near schools and enter schools as needed.\nA PTA president running for the school board in the county, Rita Montoya, said the officers allowed in schools must be properly vetted.\n\"Providing opportunities for healthy and positive engagement between students and officers is another necessary step,\" Montoya said.\nMore school districts opt for a constant, visible law enforcement presence. Worcester County Board of Education member Jon M. Andes touted his district as the first in the state to have school resource officers.\n\"We need to continue work with our law enforcement partners, enhance our summer safe schools retreat, and strengthen our proactive approach to preventing problems,\" said Andes, who is running for reelection.\nConversely, Gerry LaFemina worries about the use of officers in schools in Allegany County, where he is running for the school board.\n\"I loathe the idea of making our schools seem like they're under attack because that provides an atmosphere ripe for distraction,\" he said. \"I also worry about the use of police in the schools, which can often lead to escalation of problems rather than mediated solutions.\"\nOther than LaFemina, none of the 74 candidates who replied to a Local News Network survey questioned or opposed assigning police officers to schools.\nMore counselors?Many candidates made clear, though, that school resource officers can't solve the school safety problem alone. Twenty-five candidates mentioned increased mental health or counseling intervention as an important step in their survey response.\n\"Schools should prioritize not only physical safety but also students' social and emotional well-being,\" said Tiffini Andorful, a Prince George's County school board candidate. \"This could include increasing the number of support staff and providing access to resources and training to effectively handle conflicts. I also think there should be a greater emphasis on emergency preparedness and increased advocacy for gun control at higher levels.\"\nMany also emphasized the importance of building a healthy school atmosphere beginning when students are young.\n\"We really need to focus on social-emotional learning and fostering a culture of acceptance of others from the youngest grades and up,\" said Erica McFarland, an Anne Arundel County candidate.\nMcFarland said she feels that this type of focus can help to prevent bullying, a common reason for students to feel unsafe at school.\nMeg Ricks, a candidate in Howard County, said increased counseling services would likely stem other problems, too.\n\"We must start while students are young to give them tools for dealing with conflict and seeking help when needed,\" she said in her survey response. \"I would like to see more counselors in our schools so that we can provide students with productive solutions to the challenges they are facing.\"\nAt the same time, 13 candidates statewide said that the secret to solving the school safety puzzle lies not just in school resource officers and mental health services, but in old-fashioned school discipline.\n\"We need to re-address school discipline measures and take improved steps to reduce the threats and in some cases, violence,\" Wieland-Cherry of Talbot County said. \"Teaching and learning cannot take place in an environment (where) one feels unsafe.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

      "content": "Maryland conservatives make gains in school board races\n\n November 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Adam Hudacek Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1263\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Conservative school board candidates saw sweeping wins across Maryland this week, defying expectations in the largely blue state and solidifying the influence of the 1776 Project PAC, the Republican-aligned organization that endorsed 19 candidates statewide.In total, 11 of the political action committee's endorsed candidates either won or narrowly led their races as of Friday morning. Candidates backed by the PAC won control of the school boards in Somerset and Calvert counties, while appearing poised to win in Talbot County. Final results await the counting of some mail-in and provisional ballots, which must be counted by Nov. 15.\nCampaign finance records show that the Maryland State Education Association Fund for Children and Public Education \u2014 the political arm of the state's teachers union \u2014 spent $516,999.57 during the 2024 election cycle. And the 1776 Project PAC clearly sees the teachers' union as its defeated rival in the election.\n\"Even outspending us by $450,000, the teachers' union couldn't beat us in deep-blue Maryland\u2014their message is just too extreme,\" said Stefano Forte, executive director of the 1776 Project PAC. \"Voters chose raising test scores and graduation rates over their far-left culture war. On Tuesday, common sense won, and that has no price tag.\"\nA fourth school district with candidates targeted for defeat by Democrats \u2014 Washington County \u2014 also flipped to conservative control without the aid of the 1776 Project PAC.\nOf those 11 winners endorsed by that conservative PAC, six had also been targeted for defeat by the Maryland Democratic Party, which selected 24 \"extreme\" conservative school board candidates in the state to directly invest against \u2014 a move the party referred to as \"unprecedented.\" Of those 24, only nine have been lost thus far. The remaining 15 all won or are leading their respective races.\n\"We are proud that we pushed out some of the most extreme elements in these races,\" said Luca Amayo, spokesperson for the Maryland Democratic Party. \"It's clear, however, that we must continue to bolster our grassroots efforts and make Marylanders aware of the far-right agenda encroaching into Maryland's public schools, especially as they are emboldened under a Donald Trump presidency.\"\nThe party considers the 1776 Project PAC a \"radical ring-wing group,\" and helped defeat five of its endorsed candidates from winning office. Ryan James Girdusky, the committee's founder, wrote on the PAC's website that he created the organization \"to change public education by reforming school boards and electing reform-minded conservatives who wanted to improve public education in this country.\"\nAs of Oct. 16, the PAC had pumped $90,580.50 toward the campaigns of 13 candidates across Cecil, Queen Anne's, Talbot, Calvert, Somerset and St. Mary's counties.\nIn Calvert County, candidates endorsed by the 1776 Project PAC won all three school board seats.\nRetired principal Mike Shisler lost his bid for the board. He said he fears that the new conservative leadership, all of whom were targeted by the state's Democratic Party as well, would create inequity and fear within the county's education system.\n\"I'm very disappointed in the results,\" Shisler said Wednesday, \"It's not going to be inclusive of everybody. It's going to target folks. It's going to try to undo the work of previous boards of education when it came to stressing equity and diversity, and I think they're trying to roll back the clock.\"\nJoseph Marchio, who defeated Shisler, said he expected a close race going into Tuesday night. His margin was the closest of the three 1776 Project PAC-backed victors in Calvert County.\nIn Washington County, on the state's panhandle, all four candidates that Democrats targeted for defeat won their election, flipping the county's school board into conservative control. All three non-targeted incumbents lost reelection, while April Ann Zentmeyer, the only targeted incumbent, defended hers.\n\"I look forward to working with new board members and faithful colleagues to maximize opportunities for students, faculty, staff, and parents; and to identify solutions that will strengthen WCPS,\" Zentmeyer said in a statement.\nWashington County has a county-wide school board election process, as opposed to the school districts where candidates are elected by district. Instead of one-on-one races, all school board candidates in Washington County face each other in a crowded pool, with the top four vote-getting candidates winning seats. Carroll, Allegany and Frederick counties have similar systems.\nThe success of conservative school board candidates around Maryland reflects a larger trend from this year's election cycle: the state's rightward shift. According to data from the Associated Press, every county in Maryland shifted rightward this year compared to the 2020 election \u2014 from two points in Charles County and Baltimore City to eight points in Cecil County.\nSome races remain too close to call. In Frederick County, two conservative candidates targeted by Democrats led the race for three seats as of Friday, but two other candidates trailed close behind. Talbot County, which flipped conservative this cycle, saw two 1776 Project PAC-endorsed candidates win seats, while a third trailed by a narrow margin as of Friday with votes still left to tally.\nSomerset County, the third district flipped by 1776 Project PAC-endorsed contenders, saw massive margins of victory for the conservatives, with Mary Beth Bozman securing about four-fifths of the vote in her race. Her opponent was Alverne \"Chet\" Chesterfield \u2014 who, the Local News Network reported last month, had a peace order initiated against him in 2022.\nThe Local News Network also reported that Brandie Edelen, a 1776 Project PAC-endorsed candidate in St. Mary's County, had a state tax lien filed against her in 2019. Edelen handily lost her race to Josh Guy.\nIn deep-blue Howard County, Andrea Chamblee is in a tight race with Trent Kittleman, an early supporter of the county's Moms for Liberty chapter. Even though Democrat Kamala Harris carried over two-thirds of the votes cast in the presidential race in the county, Chamblee led Kittleman by only 3.5 points as of Friday morning.\nMail-in and provisional ballots, which have leaned in favor of Chamblee this far, are still being counted.\nThe founder of Moms for Liberty in Frederick County, Jaime Brennan, appeared headed to victory. She said that despite the Maryland Democrats' campaign against her and Colt Black, the other conservative in the race, that effort didn't appear to be all that effective.\n\"They spent a lot of money in opposition to me and Colt, and to prop up the other side, but I didn't hear from a single person who said, 'Oh, I heard about this and I'm not voting for you,'\" Brennan said.\nIn neighboring Carroll County, where Moms For Liberty lobbied for the removal of 60 books from school libraries \u2014 21 permanently \u2014 conservative candidates secured their hold on the board. Greg Malveaux and Kristen Zihmer defeated Amanda Jozkowski and Muri Lynn Dueppen, who together ran an underdog progressive campaign called the Slate for Student Success, which was endorsed by the Carroll County Educators Association.\n\"It's really a shame that a lot of voters in our county chose to kind of take their marching orders from their political party, rather than considering the opinions of the educators,\" Jozkowski said. She previously ran and lost in 2022.\nJozkowski said the race was a reflection of the national results, which saw an overwhelming rightward shift in nearly every state and in many down-ballot races. Malveaux and Zihmer were both targeted by the Maryland Democrats.\nThat rightward shift could also be seen in the school board race in Anne Arundel County's District 3. There, the conservative candidate, Chuck Yocum, fell only 2.76 points behind his opponent, Erica McFarland, despite weeks of controversy over Yocum's 1994 acquittal on child sexual abuse and perverted practices charges.\nLocal News Network reporters Sasha Allen, Marwa Barakat, Ela Jalil, Colin McNamara and Tolu Talabi contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Three new members will be sworn in next month.\n\"Your guidance and direction as board members has strengthened the bond between our community and our schools,\" Pepukayi said.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said the three outgoing members were crucial to the Board of Education's work to improve education in the county.\n\"That (work) is quietly often led by these three, which maybe you aren't aware of in the community. But I'm telling you tonight,\" Jackson said. \"We are going to be cut down at the knees. We will grow back. But we are losing three incredibly important and valuable resources.\"\nWheeler, the outgoing District 6 representative who opted not to run for reelection, served on the board for 7.5 years. Cynthia Jurrius will assume Wheeler's seat after defeating Kerry Gunshenan in this month's election.\nBoard Member Amy Dodson said she will miss Wheeler's \"pragmatism\" and \"common sense.\"\n\"I hope that I've done some good for the kids in Talbot County Public Schools. If I didn't, I know I tried,\" Wheeler said. \" \u2026 Cynthia, the person who's taking my place, is here tonight. I so enjoy your enthusiasm. I've seen you at every meeting since you registered to run, so I'm pretty sure my seat's in good hands.\"\nHowie, an assistant principal at Federalsburg Elementary School, will have her seat filled by Karla Wieland-Cherry following the District 5 election.\nJackson and Dodson said they appreciate Howie's educational expertise in her 1.5 years on the board.\n\"It has been such an honor and a blessing to see you in this role,\" Jackson told Howie. \"When your name was thrown out there as somebody who could fill the empty (District 5) seat, I think I actually physically cheered. \u2026 It feels like you made a huge impact in your short time.\"\nHenry's seat will be assumed by Ann O'Connor, who won the District 2 election over Henry. The outgoing vice president is the director of Salisbury University's Disability Resource Center.\nJackson said she's \"so proud of the work\" she accomplished alongside Henry, who has often spearheaded special education and accessibility efforts carried out by the board.\n\"As I step away from this role, I encourage you all to stay focused on what truly matters \u2014 every student, and I mean every student,\" Henry said. \"Don't let individual agendas divide you or distract you from the essential work of seeing that every student is seen as valuable and worthy of our full support.\"\n\"I wish better for our community,\" she continued, \"but now I get to just hold people accountable from another seat, and that's exactly what I plan to do.\" \n\n Copyright  2024",

All three were appointed to replace former board members.\nWheedleton was appointed to the board in 2023 to replace former board member Laura Layton, who resigned from the board that April. Wheedleton won against Jerome Harris to maintain his seat in the recent Nov. 5 general election.\nIn July, both LaMonica and Cumberland were appointed to the board. LaMonica was appointed to fill Morgan's seat after she resigned in mid-June following a contentious board vote to terminate an alternative education contract.\nCumberland was appointed to fill Diaz's seat after he resigned in late June, citing family and health concerns.\nBefore being appointed, LaMonica and Cumberland had been running against Morgan and Diaz, respectively, in the 2024 general election. Both LaMonica and Cumberland ultimately ran unopposed in the November election, allowing them to stay in the roles they were appointed to for another four years. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

      "content": "Talbot Board of Ed adds makeup day for snow; approves 2025-26 calendar\n\n January 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 580\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 During Wednesday's meeting, the Talbot County Board of Education added a day onto the end of this year's school calendar following last week's snowstorm.Talbot County Public Schools was closed Monday through Friday last week due to snow that blanketed the Mid-Shore. However, the 2024-2025 school calendar only had four inclement weather days built in, meaning an additional day was needed to comply with the state's 180-day requirement.\nHelga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, recommended that a day be added in June, moving the last day of school for students to Friday, June 13.\nThe last day for teachers would be Monday, June 16. Einhorn said that historically, most teachers complete mandated training that affords them with not having to come in on the last day.\nThe board unanimously passed the adjusted calendar for this year.\n2025-26 CALENDAROn Wednesday, the board also chose the district's calendar for the 2025-2026 school year.\nAt last month's meeting, Einhorn presented a draft calendar with two days off in March and a five-day spring break, which was the recommendation of the calendar committee. Board President Emily Jackson, however, expressed frustration there weren't multiple options posed.\nThis month, Einhorn returned with three draft calendars. The first was similar to what the board saw in December, with a four-day weekend in March and the shorter spring break. The second draft removed the off days in March and had an eight-day spring break.\nA third draft included both the March break and an eight-day spring break, pushing the last student day back to June 10, 2026.\nAll three drafts included the typical days off in November for Easton's Waterfowl Festival, as well as a winter break from Dec. 20, 2025, to Jan. 4, 2026.\n\"There is no calendar that we're going to create that is best for every single person,\" Jackson said.\nJackson said it's clear \u2014 based on previous polling and community input \u2014 that most families favor the extended spring break. Board Vice President Amy Dodson suggested the board move forward with the second or third calendars.\nBoard member Karla Wieland-Cherry said she preferred the first calendar with the shorter spring break.\n\"You're losing a lot of school time for eight days off for students,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"You're losing a lot of momentum. And plus you're concerned with providing day care. Not all employers are going to allow that. That's quite a long time to take off of work and find day care and so forth.\"\nShe added that not all families are looking for a longer spring break.\n\"My only concern is that if 59% of our students are at the poverty level, we're really talking about more of a smaller group who are really going to financially be able to afford an Easter holiday,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"\u2026 You really could possibly potentially be causing more hardship for something that's more an elitist type thing, quite honestly.\"\nJackson said while she agrees with Wieland-Cherry's point, she has \"to go with what the community is saying.\"\n\"We have asked again and again, and the majority of the respondents to any time we've asked this have said they like that spring break,\" Jackson said.\nFollowing board discussion, Jackson motioned for approval of the third calendar featuring two off days in March and five days for spring break. Her motion included an amendment to the calendar that the March days off serve as two of four inclement weather days for the district.\nBy a 6-1 vote, with only Wieland-Cherry voting against, the board approved the 2025-2026 school year calendar. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The officials decided on a post Labor Day start for the new school year.Tara Downes, assistant to the superintendent, came before the Caroline County Board of Education at the March 4 board meeting. A survey was sent out to parents and staff on what start of school day was preferred.\nAccording to the survey, pre Labor Day start of school calendar was preferred by staff and parents in Caroline County, but survey officials felt from conversations with parents that the post Labor Day calendar was preferred.\n\"What I have heard has not been this,\" Board Member Chrissy Bartz said. \"Some feedback I've received is that its not their preference.\"\nThe board members discussed what factors played into each calendar to make their decision. Teachers having a longer break was one of the deciding factors.\n\"I worry about our teachers coming back that early and have a full July of summer camp and kids in building,\" Bartz said. \"I think if we could give them a few more days and have that long weekend available for families, I am hearing families would prefer that.\"\nFor the 2025-26 school year calendar the first day of school is slated to be Tuesday, Sept. 2. Teachers will return to the building on Aug. 25 to begin planning for the new school year.\nColonel Richardson High School is set to hold graduation on May 27, 2026, and North Caroline High School is set to hold graduation on May 28, 2026.\nThe last day of school for students is June 17, and the last day for teachers is slated for the day after.\nThe county has three inclement weather days accounted for in the calendar for the new school year. In the 2024-25 school year calendar, there were four inclement weather days, and all four have been used to account for snow this winter.\n\"The board can always change the number of snow days that we build in,\" Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"The board always has the ability to take certain days that are not state required days, we just have appeal to the state.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

      "content": "Caroline County Board of Ed declares last day of school, discuss virtual instruction\n\n April 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ahmad Garnett agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The Caroline County Board of Education declared Tuesday, June 17, as the last day of the extended school year after inclement weather closures exceeded the four days allotted.The last day will be a half day for students and a full day for teachers.\nNext year, county schools will have three allotted inclement weather days. At the April 1 Board of Education meeting, district officials explored options for implementing virtual instruction should weather cause unexpected closures.\nBecause of the challenges presented by district officials, the board concluded it thinks the district will not be able to conduct virtual instruction on inclement weather days.\n\"The structure we tried to take with the presentation was a condensed version of some the requirements that the school system would have to meet if the county were to entertain virtual weather days,\" Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"We walked through some real tough spots for us to get to those points.\"\nInternet Connection and Google Meets\nThere are multiple factors Caroline County board of education most consider to conduct virtual inclement weather days. Including ensuring every student has a hotspot or wifi to participate in virtual learning.\nRobert Wielgosz, supervisor of technology, led the discussion on cellular service, offering points on the Kajeet program.\nKajeet was a hotspot used during the pandemic for students to connect to the internet in areas where wifi access was limited and not available.\nAccording to Wielgosz, when given the opportunity to use Kajeet, some students would use the hotspot for personal uses like video games and movies. This overloaded the hotspots and caused delays.\nThe estimate cost for Caroline County to provide the 700 needed Kajeet devices over five years would be about $736,000 for students and $35,000 for teachers.\nWielgosz also mentioned the need for Google Meet Breakout Rooms, which teachers use to conduct learning activities with groups in virtual classrooms. While this feature was available at no cost, it is no longer available in Caroline County's free Google plan.\n\"To get the feature back, it's going to cost Caroline County somewhere between $30,000 to $50,000 a year to get the premium Google aspect,\" Wielgosz said.\nMultilingual Learners, Special Education and Homelessness\nState law mandates districts \"ensure that all staff and students, including students with disabilities, homeless students, and English language learners, have the necessary devices at home for virtual education days, including access to Wifi.\"\nProviding equitable access to these services can be challenging during virtual instruction, district officials said.\nCaroline County has 576 multilingual learners, 569 individualized education program students and 116 students who experience homelessness. For these students, hands-on teacher engagement and preparation is required for proper learning.\n\"It's very hard to keep students engaged, especially for four hours of synchronous instruction,\" Erica McDonald, supervisor of special education, said. \"Without that in-person tangible motivating things that can keep them engaged during instruction, it can lead to increased frustration.\"\nProviding necessary technologies and translation services are also complicated by virtual instruction, the officials said.\nTeacher, staff negotiations\nSome district employees work on inclement weather days, and some staff members do not work and still get paid, district officials said.\nRequirements of the state say, \"during virtual inclement weather days the local school system shall offer public school employees who are not assigned to work during the virtual education day an opportunity to make up the lost work through other duties before the beginning of the next school year.\"\nThe district would be responsible for determining how this work would be made up.\nVirtual learning days require additional planning from teachers, which requires a negotiation with the teachers' union for proper pay.\n\"Our teachers work really hard. We all know are teachers work outside of hours. We have all come to accept that it comes with the job,\" Dr. Robert Willoughby, director of administrative services said. \"However, the law does say that we may negotiate with our teachers' union. They have a right to come to negotiate if there is extra work here we would like extra compensation for that.\"\nAfter going through the presentation, Simmons concluded it would be to hard for the county to pull off virtual inclement weather days.\n\"I don't see how as a county, with the resources we have right now, that this puts us in a great position to be able to hit all the marks to be able to pull this off effectively to meet all requirements,\" Simmons said. \n\n Copyright 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore in January, reforms the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. Freezes to annual funding increases supporting students in poverty, special education students and English language learners were among the most controversial of Moore's proposals.\nBut as the bill made its way through the General Assembly, members of the House and Senate pushed to fully implement and fund programs they deemed most necessary under the Blueprint.\nAnd when it passed Monday, it had been watered down to include only a few program changes and less sweeping budgetary cuts.\n\"At a time when the federal government is trying to eliminate the Department of Education and gut funding for schools from Mount Maryland to the Eastern Shore,\" Moore said Tuesday, \"we've delivered the largest single investment in K-12 education in the history of our state.\"\nFederal cuts left the legislature searching for ways to cut funding \u2014 especially after news from the federal government that up to $418 million in state education spending would not be reimbursed as previously expected.\nBut lawmakers decided that funding increases under the Blueprint for special education students, English language learners and schools experiencing high rates of poverty were too crucial to pause.\nThe most major cuts targeted the Blueprint's collaborative time initiative, requiring that teachers spend a portion of their workday planning. For the next three years, schools will not be required by the state to meet the priorly established teacher planning thresholds. Funding increases will also be paused for fiscal years 2027 and 2028.\n\"I think the bill that passed is fine, I mean, I think it makes some relatively modest changes,\" said Sen. Jim Rosapepe, a Democrat representing Prince George's and Anne Arundel Counties. \"I don't think it's a big deal. I think it's a little deal.\"\nBut the bill received \"no\" votes from Republican lawmakers. While much of the discourse on the bill focused on the decision to raise taxes rather than pausing more Blueprint initiatives, Sen. Jack Bailey, a Republican representing Calvert and St. Mary's Counties, said he voted against the bill because of the financial burden that it might place on counties. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He encouraged graduates to never fear, embrace hard work and maintain connections.\n\"Everyone has to start somewhere, and sometimes the correct way is not the easiest,\" Coppersmith said. With its legacy of watermen and farmers, the Eastern Shore is known even today for its strong work ethic, he said.\nKeynote speaker, former U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, was presented the college's Community Service Award in recognition of his service as a senior statesman, his Chesapeake Bay protection efforts, his dedication to human and civil rights, and his staunch advocacy for higher education.\n\"Graduation marks a profound turning point in your life. It is not only the culmination of hard work and dedication, but also the beginning of a new chapter filled with opportunity. What you do with that opportunity is up to you,\" Cardin said.\n\"Embrace hope,\" Cardin said, noting the student body was stronger due to its diversity. \"Never give up hope for a stronger, more inclusive, more equitable society,\" he said.\nCardin urged graduates to recognize history lessons as more than words in textbooks, but as guides on what not to do and on how ordinary individuals can be extraordinary.\n\"As graduates, you have the tools to think globally and act locally. You are the architects of a world where hope becomes reality,\" he said.\nFor her breakthroughs in pushing learning past the pages of textbooks, including unforgettable methods of blending academic rigor with applied learning and creative applications, the inaugural Adjunct Innovative Teaching Award was presented to Cherie Patchett, instructor of psychology.\nOpening eyes to the world of psychology, Patchett's impact was also noted to extend beyond the classroom, supporting students by establishing a mental health club on campus.\nPatchett encouraged graduates to embrace their individuality to innovate their lives.\nThe John T. Harrison Award was presented to 2025 graduate Cianni A. Phillips for her dedication and empathy. She exemplified true leadership qualities by developing student-focused campus communities.\nPhillips is a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society and is on the Dean's List with a 3.8 GPA.\nPhillips served on the Student Government Association, was president of the UHURU Black Student Union, and, in addition to numerous student clubs, served as a student worker in the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. She will transfer to Coppin State University in Baltimore to pursue a bachelor's degree in social work.\nLooking upon the graduating class, Phillips noted the students balanced all manner of life, including jobs and families, along with their schoolwork, to successfully earn a place at the commencement, which was more than a ceremony \u2014 it was a celebration and victory, she said.\nMoving forward, Phillips encouraged her classmates to continually build support networks, pour back into the community, and be the representation so strongly needed.\n\"Young people need to see what their futures can be,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025",

Both schools went through a two-year application process through MAEOE to be come Green School certified.\nAlthough directors for programs at the schools said the program was intense, they said the help they received from the community was surprising and made the process go much smoother.\n\"You have to work together, and we divided and conquered,\" said Julie Strange, pre-k teacher at and program coordinator for Green Schools at Denton Elementary. \"You have to contact people at the board office. You have to contact contact your cafeteria. You have to contact people I didn't even know did jobs.\n\"It's an intense process, but again, eye-opening how helpful everybody was and that there are people for everything.\"\nWithin that application for the program there are different subcategories for which the schools must show evidence they met the objective.\nThe application also comes with a curriculum that must be completed by the students, and the school must provide one example of outdoor or environmental instruction per grade level.\n\"Through our curriculum and standards, we're able to teach these kids sustainability practices and how to take care of the Earth, just learning about the Earth through those environmental literacy standards. It's one of my passions. I really enjoy doing it,\" said Zellie Kneller Kidigarden, a teacher and program director for Green Schools at Greensboro Elementary.\nThroughout the application process, the elementary schools have been able to produce multiple projects that help compost, save energy and grow fresh foods.\nOne project at Denton Elementary involves collecting breakfast bags in the morning after breakfast. According to Strange, the school lets third graders create boxes and put recycle signs on them to put in their classrooms to collect bags in the morning.\n\"Every day, we get breakfast in plastic bags per child, and our school is about 650 kids. So that's 650 bags that go in the trash every day,\" Strange said. \"The kids were so excited about it, and they did it... the kids are responsible for putting their bag in there when they're done their breakfast instead of throwing it in the trash.\"\nOne of the projects Greensboro Elementary conducts is planting in multiple gardens.\n\"We do strawberries, herbs in our garden tower and then we have our pollinator garden. Our Environmental Club also planted native plants everywhere in our swales. Before the end of the school year, we're going to plant native plants in our courtyard,\" Kneller said.\nKneller credits community partners for being helpful in their pursuit to becoming a green school.\nSome of the organizations Greensboro Elementary has partnered with are Pickering Creek Audubon Center, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Tuckahoe State Park, Wetlands on Wheels and many more.\n\"I'm so grateful that we're a community school because being a community school allows us to work with... stakeholders in the community, and we get wonderful things from all the members in the community,\" Kneller said.\nGreensboro Elementary has been a green school since 2021 and will go through a renewal next year. The school has been able to secure multiple grants that will lead to future projects, including tree planting and much more.\nBoth Kneller and Strange believe every school should be Green School certified.\n\"It's really, really, really important work and every school should be green school certified,\" Kneller said. \"It is life-changing for a lot of students and adults and I would say everyone because this is the planet that we live on and everyone needs to learn how to take care of it because we don't have anywhere else to go.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So, this building is going to stay. It's going to keep its history.\"\nThough it was never indicated as a preferred option, staying at the current site and renovating was left on the table at prior committee meetings and discussions on the new school.\nThe May meeting featured two potential locations for a new school, the first location would be behind North Caroline High School, and the second would be on Double Hills Road in Denton.\nAfter a public hearing at that meeting, the committee came back with models and options for the school at two potential new locations.\n\"There was a lot of feedback last time about the safety issue for buses coming and going, as well as parent drop off,\" Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"So, I think the architect did the best they could with the two existing locations that the county has told us to look at to kind of make them as usable as possible.\"\nThe presentation given Monday premiered three building layout options for the North Caroline High location and two options for the Double Hills Road location.\nThe North Caroline High design options included two plans for a two-story style building with wings separated by grade level. Though these designs for the building itself are identical, the building is located in different places on the lot in each design.\nOne option proposes relocating the North Caroline High baseball and softball fields to a different location. The other keeps the middle school on the left and everything belonging to the high school on the right side of the property.\nThe third design option would also involve relocating the fields and would also relocate the solar array on the site. The existing barn and fenced pasture would also be rebuilt in a new location.\nThis third option is a three-story building design, with each floor being a different grade level.\n\"The different locations on North Carolina High School was interesting,\" Simmons said. \"I think most of us in our heads ahead of time could envision it in one spot, but giving the flexibility of the options really opened up some some pathway.\"\nThe Double Hills Road location designs featured the two- and three-story options as at the North Caroline location.\nWhile both options propose that the solar panels currently at the site may need to be located another portion of the county property and that new pump station will need to be constructed, entrance options, building locations and parking locations are different.\n\"Double Hills Road with the new county road going in in that property does preserve a 20 plus acre plot for to use,\" Simmons said. \"It's good location but again it gives us that flexibility now to see what the buses would look like coming and going. What drop off would look like, what staff parking would look like because there's nowhere near enough staff parking here as well.\"\nNow that the Lockerman Middle School Committee has presented all options, the public will have until before June 9 to respond to an online survey with their comments.\nThe top ranked designs for both locations will be presented to the Caroline County Board of Education in July. Then the Board of Education will make a decision on a location no later than August to make sure the timeline for construction stays on track.\nTo participate in the survey, visit carolineschools.org/article/2241492.\n. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She plans to attend Towson University and major in nursing starting in the fall. She will already be multiple semesters ahead.\nEnnals' love for health care came during her freshman year of high school, but she decided she wanted to be a neonatal intensive care unit nurse during her sophomore year.\n\"When I just like actually sat down and was able to research and just gather data on all these different branches, that's what really like sealed the deal for me,\" she said.\nEnnals is not the first child of her mother, Maria Bowser, to participate in the dual enrollment program at Chesapeake College. Ennals' two older sisters participated in the program in Talbot County, both graduating with a plethora of college credits to pursue nursing.\nEnnals knew from watching her sisters complete dual enrollment classes that the workload was difficult, but she knew she was up to the task.\nEnnals said she faced challenges getting enrolled in the courses she needed.\nAfter an auditorium presentation with all juniors at North Caroline explaining dual enrollment options, Ennals went to her guidance counselor to talk about the process of doing dual enrollment and potentially graduating from Chesapeake College before graduating from high school.\n\"I tried to bring it up to my guidance counselor and they kind of deterred me from taking the dual enrollment classes, and that's when we decided to have a meeting about that and that's what got me into those classes,\" Ennals said.\n\"My guidance counselor told me that it was going to be too hard for me, which I was very confused as to why they would think that because I was already ahead when I first came to that school.\"\nBowser and Ennals met with counselors at North Caroline for several weeks about what course work would be best for Ennals.\n\"If she wants to be a nurse, and she knows she's going to college, college classes are the better path for her. However, we got a little pushback,\" Bowser said.\nA representative from Caroline County Public Schools said the district was unable to discuss conversations between students, parents and employees.\nAfter more pushback, Bowser and Ennals began to work with the Gabrilla Moreland, TRIO Upward Bound academic coordinator, and Mark Berry, director of TRIO program at Chesapeake College.\nThe TRIO Upward Bound program offers high school students from Caroline, Kent and Talbot counties an opportunity to gain college and career readiness skills, through tutoring, workshops and field trips at no cost to students.\nThe group set down with county Board of Education and came up with a plan to allow Enalls to take four college classes during her junior year of high school.\n\"I wasn't taking the 'no she can't take classes because it's too hard.' How was it too hard? She had a 4.0, and she was managing everything and had all of her high-school credits by her 11th grade year,\" Bowser said.\nEnnals said it became a \"prove them wrong type of situation.\"\n\"I loved it because it was a lot of motivation knowing that there were education officials telling me that I can't do something. So I just used that as motivation to just let me get through it. Let me kind of not only prove to myself but also prove to them,\" Ennals said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

      "content": "Foundation of HOPE's new building to expand middle school girls program\n\n June 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 559\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Since 2017, the Foundation of HOPE has grown into a beloved nonprofit in the Easton community, building bright futures for middle school girls. Soon, the foundation will have its own building.A project to create a dedicated Foundation of HOPE space on the corner of South Washington and South streets is moving along after the Easton Planning Commission approved its site plan Tuesday.\nFounder and President Keasha Haythe remembers comments made by the first girls she welcomed into the organization's after-school program eight years ago.\n\"They said, 'Ms. Keasha, are we going to have our own space?'\" recalled Haythe, who also serves on the Talbot County Council.\nA building wasn't always in the cards, Haythe said, but in 2020, she and the nonprofit's board realized a separate space could be beneficial. Since schools shut down, and that's where the program's classes took place, the program was put on hold during the pandemic.\n\"If something like this happens again, it would be better if we have our own space,\" Haythe said.\nFor nearly a decade, the foundation has brought on a cohort of sixth grade girls each spring to engage in programming on economic development, entrepreneurship and self-confidence. The girls are followed through high school, and some that are heading off to college receive scholarships.\nThe after-school program would typically take place in Easton Middle School. Most recently, Haythe's nonprofit added St. Michaels Middle School and 10 students to the cohort.\nNow, the Foundation of HOPE is planning its own 5,200-square-foot, two-story building. It's a $2.2 million project, with over $1.8 million already raised, Haythe said. Construction could begin as soon as September.\nOnce it opens, girls from Easton Middle would be within walking distance to attend the after-school program, and Haythe hopes for St. Michaels students to be bussed to Easton. Expansion will occur, too.\n\"I've had parents reach out from private schools as well,\" Haythe said. \"I do believe the building will allow us to open it up to those that may be home-schooled as well.\"\nPlanning Commission members complimented the design work done by the Foundation of HOPE and architect Crosby & Associates, saying it fit the commercial character of South Washington Street but didn't stick out too much from the residential homes on South Street.\n\"Fantastic job with this site design,\" said Vice Chair Michael Ports. \"It's a perfect transition to these two different areas. It's quite awesome.\"\nDuring discussion, some concerns about safety were raised, stemming from the South Washington and South streets vehicular intersection and the fact there aren't marked crosswalks.\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh said independent of the project, the town is aware of those safety concerns and is looking to improve the intersection for pedestrians, bicyclists and vehicles.\nWhile the nonprofit has obtained OKs from the Planning and Historic District Commissions, Haythe noted there are still steps left in the approval process, including permits.\nBut the building may soon be a reality for future cohorts of girls. Along with office space, Haythe envisions a reading room, fun area, cooking lessons and much more for the sixth graders. And it could help spark even more excitement from the students once they have a building to call the Foundation of HOPE home.\n\"For them to come to the classroom for the after-school program, it's asking a lot of them to stay in that building until we're done with our sessions,\" Haythe said. \"This will break that up.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He noted that during interviews, she indicated interest in owning her own business one day.\nThe apprenticeship comes at a time when he says the company is on a mission to get girls and young women involved in the construction and building industry and empower them to go after job opportunities in similar fields.\nOlde School Builders has recently partnered with Easton Middle School to run a Girls Who Build club. Postlewait said this past spring, the students who joined were hesitant at first but left feeling more confident and comfortable.\nOn June 16, Postlewait expressed excitement to welcome Escalante-Garcia on board for the summer and following school year. He said he wants people and young girls to gain that confidence in areas that may, at times, not be considered by most high schoolers.\n\"We're so happy to have her with us,\" Postlewait said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They got great skill.\"\nWith the school year approaching, the board of education wants to make a decision on the policy sooner rather than later. Board members agreed to get rid of the pouches, but they will likely come up with an alternative like locking student's personal devices in lockers or backpacks.\nThe board made a motion to pass the policy as a first read with the understanding that revisions will be made before the second read and final approval at the next meeting on Aug. 21 at 6 p.m. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Pepukayi asked everyone to remember why they got into education \u2014 for the students.\n\"I want us to remember this feeling when we're happy, we have smiling faces, and we see our students,\" Pepukayi said. \"Because we all know what happens, the rollercoaster of education.\"\n\"It'll go up and down, it'll ebb and flow,\" she added. \"But remember your why.\"\nChildren return to the classroom on Monday for the first day of school. Before teachers get into the full swing, Pepukayi unveiled new district initiatives to staff.\nOne is what she called a \"community bus.\" Decked out with school logos, it will go around the community providing clothes, food and other needs to families, Pepukayi said.\nShe updated staff on two other items. The staff health center in Easton is under construction and expected to open sometimes this fall. District officials have had to overcome delayed construction work on the project this spring due to a federal reimbursement snag.\nMeanwhile, a new early learning center for kids up to 5 years old is in the works for White Marsh Elementary School in Trappe, Pepukayi said. This spring, Tilghman Elementary School opened its Judy Center, joining Easton and St. Michaels.\nGiovanni Wynn, family service coordinator at the St. Michaels site, delivered a speech on the importance of early learning and her excitement for White Marsh Elementary to join the district's other Judy Centers.\nWynn, the 2025-26 Talbot Support Staff of the Year, and Easton High School band director Lauren Rose, the Teacher of the Year, each were presented with new cars from Hertrich Chevy Buick GMC of Easton and General Manager Pat Papineau.\nOther awards were presented on Thursday, including the J. Sam Meek Unsung Hero Award. Pepukayi spoke on the impact of the two winners: Kristen Tilghman, former Blueprint implementation coordinator, and Michelle Ringgold, administrative assistant of curriculum.\nTilghman, now assistant principal at Easton High School, spent three years as the district's point person in carrying out The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's expansive education reform package.\n\"When I first came on board, the Blueprint was alive and kicking, and I had no idea what it was about,\" Pepukayi said. \"... She helped me tremendously in navigating through the Blueprint.\"\nRinggold has juggled a large budget, supporting field trips and arranging tutors to go to classrooms in her role at the Talbot County Education Center, Pepukayi said.\n\"When I walk in, no matter what day, no matter what challenge she's been through, there's always a smile on her face,\" Pepukayi said of Ringgold. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The days were filled with numerous agriculture topics and allowed the students to have many hands-on experiences at learning stations lead by industry experts including aquaculture, grain, farm animals, food safety and pollination, he said,\nThis year in particular focused on the variety of career opportunities available within local agriculture, according to Page.\n\"Even if it's in ag, you might not be a farmer,\" said Jenell Eck McHenry of Thompson Ag Consulting Programs.\n\"Our whole premise of the day is to start to get students to really realize what is agriculture, how does it affect their lives, and so on,\" he said.\nAfter the two-day event, seventh-grade students penned essays to showcase what they discovered and answer the question, \"How did your experience change the way you view agriculture?\"\nThe Agricultural Awareness Committee reviewed the essays and selected the most impactful responses as winners.\nThe overall winner of the essay contest was Ellamae Athey of Centreville Middle School.\nFor Centreville Middle School, first place was awarded to Sara Klakring, second place was a tie between Teyauna Johnson and Wyatt Stephens and third place was a tie between Lucas Henderson and JP Tyler.\nFor Matapeake Middle School, first place was awarded to Delaney Grace Pugh, second place to Vivian Dorsey and third place to Jessica Lynn Busch.\nFor Stevensville Middle School, first place was presented to Conner Paterno.\nConstantly growing, this year's event saw over 100 volunteers dedicating their time and resources including animals to showcase ag awareness to the community seventh graders, said Lee Bridgman University of Maryland Extension Program Assistant Agriculture and Horticulture.\nThe partnership between the Queen Anne's County schools and the agricultural community continues to make an educating and exciting program and is already looking forward to next year, Page said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

      "content": "Talbot County Ag Center turns 60\n\n July 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 522\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 On July 23, 1964, Donald Spies, Thomas Meredith and John Mulder signed on as founders of the Talbot County Agriculture & Education Center on Hiners Lane.With decades of 4-H showcases and county fairs under its belt, the Agriculture and Education Center is turning 60.\nIn partnership with member organizations Easton FFA, Easton Lions Club, Talbot County 4-H, Talbot County Farm Bureau, and Tri-County Ruritan, the Ag Center aims to strengthen rural Talbot County culture and provide agricultural education experiences.\nAmanda Clougherty, president of the Ag Center, says it's a team effort to prepare for large events like the fair.\n\"What makes us unique here is we are independently-owned,\" Clougherty said. \"We are a nonprofit organization. All of our neighboring county fair facilities are all owned by county governments. So we have a lot of things to worry about. We have to worry about facility maintenance, repairs, operations.\"\nAs co-chair of Ag Center's fair committee, Clougherty says that the fair has maintained that unique distinction.\n\"We know who we are,\" she said. \"We're a small, old-time, family-fun outing.\"\nWhile the center is hosting its 41st county fair this week, it serves the community year-round, not just during fair weekend. It hosts events such as weddings, birthday parties, meetings and workshops.\nWith no full-time paid staff members, the Ag Center relies on volunteers through community organizations. It makes for a truly unique and personable experience during any event, Clougherty said.\n\"It's a labor of love and service,\" she said.\nNEW PARTNERSHIPSClougherty says the Ag Center is always open to new relationships throughout the county. For instance, the Rotary Club of Easton recently held its first event at the center to initiate new officers.\nAnother new partnership is coming this fall, as four soccer fields at the property will house Chapel District Sports' first year of soccer practices and games while Chapel District Elementary School is under construction.\n\"I just think it's a really good way to expose people to what we do here and build that community connectedness,\" Clougherty said.\nShe believes that partnership and similar ones will allow \"kids and families to come together.\" She also mentioned an \"ag-accurate book trail\" will be on the grounds of the center by this fall, which will feature readings and activities at multiple stations.\nIMPROVEMENTSAs the Ag Center grows in its community reach, so has the need for facility improvements. Clougherty pinpointed recent upgrades, including up-to-date electric and a new sound system.\nFacility improvements would be completely different without assistance from Maryland 4-H youth, Clougherty said. Through Maryland 4-H's Diamond Clover Award Program, which requires service hours, local youth have transformed the Ag Center.\nShe said 4-H members have been responsible for rebuilding the outdoor stage, barns, installing fans in the buildings and making benches and the sidewalk accessible.\n\"We wouldn't be as far as we are today if it hadn't been for several outstanding youth throughout the years,\" Clougherty said.\nIt's just one example of how the community gives back to the Ag Center that has long served county residents, particularly youth.\n\"It's a special gold star for the kids who see the need and work hard to contribute,\" Clougherty said. \"Because they know they've benefitted from being out here.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) spoke to the state legislators on his excitement for the Trump administration that was sworn in on Monday and the changes that will be made to government spending now that Tesla CEO Elon Musk will co-lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.\n\"I do believe that we have to operate more, and the federal government has to operate more like the private sector does,\" Harris said. \"...Elon Musk is going to do in terms of promoting government efficiency because in the end we cannot continue trillion dollar deficits into the future. We have to control federal spending. We are cursed with without a balanced budget amendment.\"\nSeveral Republican delegation members at the meeting echoed these sentiments.\nMany spoke on the state of Maryland and the amount of federal employees it has, some saying the state is too heavily dependent on federal employment.\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said recent actions of some state officials in response to actions taken by the Trump administration do not align with Maryland's needs. He said the state is \"trying to find $3 billion\" and yet is involved in lawsuits against the federal government.\n\"The (Maryland) attorney general seems to have plenty of money to want to sue the federal government,\" Hutchinson said. \"Well, at the same time, the state has their hand out to the federal government saying, 'I need money for the Key Bridge. I need more Medicaid money.'\"\nPRIORITIES FOR FARMERSThroughout the meeting, several representatives and supporters of farmers and agriculture policy spoke, including Tyler Hough, director of government relations for the Maryland Farm Bureau, who shared priorities for the organization for the next fiscal year.\nHough said the bureau has three policy priorities, including private property rights and eminent domain, solar energy, and agriculture education. In his presentation, he focused on the importance of education for the state.\n\"The opportunity to educate the youth, even get into the middle school areas, the opportunity to have education in the high schools and the FFA (agriculture education) programs and the value that FFA brings along with the 4-H programs that already exist, is just fantastic for these students,\" Hough said.\nLater on the agenda, a presentation was made by members of the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology, an organization centering scientific research, policy analysis and outreach and education efforts.\nKate Everts, executive director of the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology, led the in-depth presentation, in which she highlighted the Maryland Climate-Smart Agriculture Project and the extensive outreach to Eastern Shore farmers that the center has done.\nEverts said the farm-centered project seeks to find what agriculture needs to be adaptable and profitable for a future dictated by climate change.\n\"We're seeing changes in weather across the country, but here in Maryland,\" Everts said, \"how is it impacting our farms and our forests? And again, we want to make sure that they are in a good position to stay economically viable going forward. So we're all about making sure their businesses are successful.\"\nEverts said the research team evaluated potential impacts on local agriculture and conducted outreach with farmers and service providers.\nToward the end of the presentation, Harris shared his appreciation for the work that the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology does for farmers and the importance of keeping them in the forefront of policy and work done for the state.\n\"It's very good to hear this presentation today because so often what happens in Annapolis is we go up with a lot of emotion, a lot of heart to represent and protect the interests of Agriculture, and what you're talking about, along with other institutions, is bringing science to bear with the lens of the Eastern Shore and certainly throughout the state. The point is through the lens of agriculture, which is so important,\" Harris said.\nThe next meeting of the Eastern Shore Delegation will be held on Jan. 31 via Zoom. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The group pledged to align Eastern Shore practices with the administration\u2019s climate goals, streamline grant applications, and launch pilot farms by spring 2026. Officials said the meeting will accelerate sustainable agriculture and economic growth in the region.",

Gladwin from the University System of Maryland spoke about a new program that would bring medical students to the Eastern Shore, and Sara Rich talked about the growth of the Choptank Community Health System.\nGladwin, who is dean of the University of Maryland School of Medicine and vice president for medical affairs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, talked about the Rural Health Equity and Access Longitudinal elective program.\nOnce in place, he said the program will have students spend their first two years in Baltimore, coming to the Eastern Shore to do rotations. For students' last two years, they will spend four months of each year learning and training on the Eastern Shore.\nThis program will address a need for more health care on the Shore, Gladwin said. The five counties in the state with the fewest primary care physicians per capita are all on the Eastern Shore.\n\"As we all know, there is a pressing need to enhance physician and medical provider services and hospital services for the Eastern Shore,\" he said.\nThis new program is a partnership between the University of Maryland, Baltimore, the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. Between the three partners, Gladwin said $300,000 has been invested to start the program.\nHe said a director, assistant director and administrative support staff have been hired. The estimated cost to support and build the program is about $2.2 million per year, Gladwin said.\n\"We put in a federal grant for the program,\" he said. \"And we think it would be very helpful to get state support for this.\"\nGladwin said they are mainly seeking scholarship support for the program. He said they would like to be able to give out full scholarships to students in the program who agree to staying on the Eastern Shore to work.\n\"We think there's a lot of interest (from) our students in rural health care, in health equity,\" Gladwin said. \"And we think this could be a signature program to attract future doctors.\"\nEastern Shore Delegation Chair Del. Chris Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said he was appreciative of the efforts to get this program going.\n\"It is surely needed,\" he said of the program.\nAlso during the meeting on Friday, Choptank Community Health System CEO Sarah Rich talked about Choptank Community Health's expansions on the Shore.\nCurrently, the health system has seven health centers and 18 school-based health centers across Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties.\nRich said progress on the construction of its new center in Federalsburg is moving along \"very well.\" The health system broke ground on this project in the early summer of 2023.\nThis new center will have five wings for medical, dental and behavioral health services. It will house a rural residency program in partnership with the University of Maryland School of Medicine and University of Maryland Shore Regional Health, as well as a dental residency program.\nRich also talked about Choptank Community Health's expansion into Kent County, which includes a health center in Chestertown and a school-based health center in Rock Hall.\nBehavioral health in schools is another way the health system has expanded.\n\"We know that is a huge need,\" she said. \"So we do have therapists now in Caroline and Talbot counties.\"\nRich said they plan to offer these services to students in Kent County and Queen Anne's County schools next. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Those attending came from Dorchester, Kent, Talbot and Queen Anne's counties.\nThe program was spearheaded by Dorine Fasset of Queen Anne's County Department of Health, Prevention Services and her colleague Anna Ashley. In addition to the Department of Health, this event had support from Citizens Against Smoking Tobacco Coalition and Chesapeake College Office of Student Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.\nThe program is made available through a grant from Kent County Health Department and Maryland Department of Health.\nAccording to the latest available data from the 2021-2022 school year, over one in four high school students within the five-county Mid-Shore region are current tobacco users. This epidemic is largely driven by the use of electronic smoking devices, e-cigs, or vapes, which have been heavily marketed to teens.\nThe summit featured rap and dance performances aimed at promoting a passion for healthy choices and encouraging young people to reject harmful habits. Special guest Sterlen Barr, CEO of Rapping About Prevention, hoped to inspire attendees with his message of positivity and resilience.\nDr. LaMarr Shields of Baltimore's Cambio Group led the morning session with his son Mosiah by his side. An inspirational speaker, educator, thought-leader, author and artist, Shields creates with purpose in all aspects of his professional and personal life using the common thread of Ubuntu philosophy: a person is a person through other people.\nAn Open Society Institute Fellow and a former faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Education, Shields is co-founder and senior director of education and innovation at the Cambio Group. Shields dedicates his life to inspiring adults and youth alike to pursue a higher purpose, achieve sustainable value for long-term success, and cope with adversity in order to create opportunities in their personal, professional and spiritual lives.\nFurther inspiration was provided through the music and dance of Barr, aka NoPuffDaddy, delivering a high-energy performance using facts, humor, personal experience, teamwork exercises and audience participation. Rapping About Prevention teaches the importance of maintaining a positive, drug-free, safe, healthy and active lifestyle all while having an amazing and memorable experience.\nBarr's own journey began in Philly over 30 years ago when he lost his grandmother to lung cancer. He began writing and rapping as a way to work through his grief, and hopes to help prevent other families from feeling the same pain. A lifetime athlete and former boxer, Barr's presentation style is high energy on purpose \u2014 and it too draws the students to the message.\nPresented to students in middle and high schools across the country, he reaches thousands each year with his work. He says, \" Kids don't care about how much you know until they know how much you care.\"\nShields shared, \"We are addicted almost at birth to sugar and salt \u2014 it's one of the reasons kids say they vape \u2014 because it tastes good.\" Shields has spent a lifetime understanding the reasons people and especially our kids get hooked on these substances so easily. These summits are one of the ways he says we can combat it \u2014 through understanding and providing a message that reaches the kids. Watching the response as he walked his audience through his presentation made it clear the message was hitting the mark.\nHigh school student Wyatt Tolker attending the session with his mom Kerieanne Hinerman, Dorchester County's Tobacco Program Coordinator, was inspired to write verse in response to one of the exercises.\nSpeaking after the session with Tolker, he relayed the thought process behind his inspiration, \"I've always written stuff \u2014 I have a notebook full of things I've written. When Dr. Shields asked us to write down our responses, I knew I wanted to present a message that would appeal and speak to the other kids in the room, regardless of their age.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If passed at a future meeting, they will approve a combined $1.5 million in funding for three projects: new auditorium lights at Easton High School ($817,321), light replacements at St. Michaels Middle High School ($556,000) and athletic field improvements across the district ($116,679).\nThe fiscal year 2025 budget already accounted for the capital costs, County Manager Clay Stamp noted. The three bills would simply authorize the usage of funds for those three projects, respectively.\nTalbot County Public Schools Director of Operations Kevin Shafer said Easton High's auditorium lights date back to the school's renovation in 1997.\nTalbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher said he's noticed \"how desperately needed this lighting system is.\"\n\"In order to put on some of the really quality student productions that we've seen at Easton High School, I believe that some of the lighting directors have been bringing equipment in from \u2026 the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and other places to supplement the antiquated equipment that the auditorium itself has,\" Lesher said.\n\"We've moved into an era of LED lighting, which didn't exist back in 1997,\" Lesher added. \"This is going to be a huge leap forward.\"\nShafer said the light replacements and improvements at St. Michaels Middle High School will complete the ongoing LED conversion product across the entire St. Michaels campus. Grant funding allowed for new side lights at St. Michaels Elementary, Shafer said.\nThe $117,000 for athletic field improvements will help the district move forward with its grass field upgrades.\n\"Generally speaking, the athletic field improvements are going to be surrounding the current fields that we have, grass fields,\" Shafer said. \"(We are) doing some longstanding improvements related to some issues or concerns that came up.\"\nA public hearing on the three bills will be held during Talbot County Council's Feb. 11 meeting at 5:30 p.m. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was one of many vendors who had previously attended the event not to distribute resources, but to receive them.\n\"It's really refreshing to be able to give back,\" Jefferson said. \"Just a couple years ago, I was somebody that was coming through the doors and receiving services myself, so it's good to see that we can help families in need.\"\nThe Caroline Cares Community Resource Day featured around 40 vendors providing information, help and food to the community.\n\"This is what it's all about,\" said Stephanie Johnson, His Hope Ministries' executive director and board member for Resources Day. \"Just getting all the resources in one building so that it can be kind of an easily accessible for those who need them the most. Being able to bring those providers under one roof, on a specific day, to get those services out to everybody who needs them is huge.\"\nOne of the main focuses for Resource Day is providing many different types of help for many different people.\nSome attendees face expenses they can't afford or are just in a bad financial situation, and some people are homeless. Resources Day helped with a variety of situations.\nDirectors expect 100 to 150 county residents experiencing homelessness to attend Resources Day every year, and they have a plan to make sure homeless residents can find shelter.\n\"With this particular event, they have access to walk around, talk to the vendors and see what exactly what their services are that they provide,\" Johnson said. \"However, like when it comes to those who are actually experiencing homelessness, we have a separate room set aside for them to really dig into what their needs are and see how we can connect them with services.\"\nCaroline County Public Schools officials attended, providing information for children on enrollment in school and many different resources for mental and physical health. United4Caroline provided free diapers for families with infants.\nChesapeake College's nursing program provided free blood pressure checks for all people in attendance. Nursing students gained experience and enjoyed serving the community.\n\"Oh, I love this, and I'm actually from Denton myself, so to give back to the community is amazing,\" Katie Reuwer, an assistant professor at Chesapeake College, said. \"It's a great experience for the students to really learn about community service and helping others. I've already had some really good feedback from the students about how much they enjoy it.\"\nStaff from Studio 107 Hair Salon in Kent Island and Edwards All Star Barbershop in Denton enjoyed providing free haircuts and styles at Resource Day, something both shops provide every year.\n\"There's no better feeling,\" Lisa Milligan, owner of Studio 107, said. \"You're helping people that are maybe down on their luck or they're just getting out of jail or they're just going for jobs. It's every aspect, older people that can't afford to get their hair cut especially in this economy. So it's great to give back.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025",

The transgender symbol, often used to encourage gender inclusivity, is a combination of the male and female signs.\nAt an unusually crowded bail hearing on Monday afternoon, Talbot County District Court Judge Karen Ketterman ordered King to be held without bond in the Detention Center. A trial is scheduled for Oct. 28.\nMany parents and school officials from Sts. Peter and Paul filled the courtroom. School Board Chair Peggy Wilson asked Ketterman to not approve King's release. Wilson cited the Aug. 27 shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, which killed two children and injured 18 people, as a reason why the school community is concerned for the safety of students.\n\"Our fear is not the symbol itself, but the possibility of a copycat situation,\" Wilson said.\nKing, according to public legal representation, is transgender. She previously attended Sts. Peter and Paul School.\nThe Minneapolis shooter, Robin Westman, was referred to as transgender by federal officials. Westman's gender identity wasn't clear, according to The Associated Press.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook said in a statement this weekend that the graffiti incidents are \"especially painful\" given the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting.\n\"It reminds us of the responsibility we all share to ensure our children's safety and well-being,\" Cook wrote. \"We condemn such acts of intimidation, they have no place in our community.\"\nIn a statement Sunday, the Delmarva Pride Center condemned the graffiti acts as a \"misuse\" of the international transgender symbol.\n\"We are deeply troubled that an LGBTQIA+ symbol was misused in a way that could be construed as hateful,\" the statement read. \"Symbols such as the Transgender Symbol exist to affirm identity, celebrate diversity, and foster belonging \u2014 not to spread fear or division.\n\"This incident occurs at a time when Transgender people continue to face targeted attacks in society. We call on our neighbors, allies, and community members to stand together, to reject hate in all its forms, and to embrace the values of acceptance, compassion, and love.\"\nOn Monday, Easton Police Deputy Chief Greg Wright said the agency will increase patrol this week at Sts. Peter and Paul School and other schools in town. He said police \"have no reason to believe that there was any attempt or desire to harm anyone.\"\nBOND DECISION\nBridgette Lane, an assistant at the Talbot County public defender's office, argued in court on Monday that King should be granted release based on the low severity of charges, an otherwise clean criminal record and the Detention Center's recommendation.\nLane said King has \"expressed remorse\" and understands \"she can't be acting out in these ways.\"\nKing, who is listed as having a Baltimore address, was recently staying in Easton with her mother, Lane said. If released, the expectation was for King to stay with her mother.\nTalbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said the graffiti incident is concerning due to the context of the Minneapolis shooting last month, as well as the fact that King's mother's house is close to the school.\n\"Here we have this clear warning sign,\" Coale said. \" ... We don't know if the defendant is capable of carrying out something worse. But the state doesn't want to find out.\"\nKetterman said both sides made good points, but she hammered home that there are \"no conditions of release\" that would ensure the safety of the community. The judge said she's concerned about the location of the graffiti and King's documented mental health diagnoses, which include bipolar disorder and PTSD.\n\"I don't think the court has another choice,\" Ketterman said after ruling no bond and ordering the defendant complete a mental health evaluation.\nInformation from The Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The sprinkler system activated, limiting fire damage to the room where it started.\nAccording to the Office of the Maryland State Fire Marshal, the fire originated in a rear first-floor office. The preliminary cause was deemed accidental, the result of \"an unspecified electrical event of a power surge protector.\"\nThe fire marshal estimated about $30,000 in structure and content damages. No injuries were reported.\nA total of 36 firefighters responded, with Goodwill Volunteer Fire Company the primary agency in charge. The fire was brought under control in about 30 minutes, the fire marshal said.\nThe fire alarm company contacted 911, and the school custodian also discovered the fire after the alarm activation.\nWater collected in a back hallway, one special education classroom, an office and a conference room as the sprinkler system ran for about 20 minutes, Kibler said.\nThird-party contractors were brought in to evaluate and assist. Normal operations resumed Sept. 11, after the school was closed to students and non-essential personnel Wednesday to allow cleanup and assessment. Other Queen Anne's County Public Schools were not affected.\nQACPS expressed gratitude to first responders, the Queen Anne's County Fire Marshal's Office, the Maryland State Deputy Fire Marshal, and its custodial and maintenance staff for their work in returning the building to use.\nOn its Facebook page, QACPS wrote: \"We are thankful that there were no injuries, and our fire suppression system worked appropriately.\"\nQuestions should be directed to Principal Lou Sheppard, Kibler said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat.

The following year, he began publishing what is now The Journal of African American History, a publication of history, research and book reviews.\nIn 1926, Woodson founded \"Negro History Week\" to honor the history, culture and contributions of African Americans. He chose February to coincide with the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln. In 1976, President Gerald Ford extended the observation to a month, now known as Black History Month.\nWoodson believed that history was \"made by the people, not simply or primarily by great men.\"\nLocal writer, Niambi Davis had the opportunity to contribute to the Black History display at Bethel AME. The subjects, Davis said, \"are important and more than just the usual Douglass and Tubman stories; they're the unknown local, national and international folks.\"\nThe display is open to the congregation and anyone wishing to attend services.

Martinez said her story stems from an immigration story.\n\"I'm really proud of that because of (my parents') struggle, and their survival and their grit, I'm able to stand here in front of you today,\" she said.\nHer mother migrated from Mexico and her father from El Salvador. She grew up in Chicago, which she describes as \"a city that really appreciated and celebrated what it means to be Latina,\" though the city was heavily segregated.\nAfter meeting her husband and getting married, she moved to New York and became a teacher in the South Bronx, known as the poorest school district in the country. There, Martinez learned of excellence.\nShe said she was expected to perform at a level of excellence that she had never been asked to before, and in turn she learned to expect it from the people and students around her.\nShe said the South Bronx \"will forever be a part of my story and my legacy.\"\nAfter spending her time in the South Bronx, Martinez moved to Talbot County. It was a culture shock, but to her surprise, she found a growing Latino population. Her new home also forced her to affirm and challenge her own identity as a Latina.\nMartinez worked for Talbot County Public Schools and then founded Mid-Shore Scholars, a college prep program that serves first-generation college students.\nWhen leading the program, she decided it was time to focus on the marginalized student population. The program was meant to target a population of students who had the potential to go to Ivy Leagues, but she pushed for a different perspective. Martinez said it was important to focus on the students who lacked the resources to get to college.\n\"It's these students who don't have any help at home, who don't have any representation, whose parents want to give them the best life but didn't go to college here, who don't know the ropes or don't know how to navigate the system,\" Martinez said.\nDuring the pandemic, she decided to focus on building an institution to better assist marginalized communities and helped create the Polaris Village Academy. Martinez said the academy centers joy, celebrating culture and empowering students and families, making them feel safe and seen.\nMartinez ended her presentation with photos of her family visiting their native countries and the importance that focusing on her roots allowed her the opportunity to help those around her to grow.\n\"My superpower is that I am bicultural, that I have roots in (El Salvador) and in Mexico, and I have roots here, and that I can be both from there and from here, and then it's not 'and/or.' I could bring my whole self,\" Martinez said. \"And I encourage all the students here who are questioning their identity or wondering if they can be authentically themselves when they go to class or when they step into white institutions that yes, you can.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said the threat is a photo of a \"clearly\" photoshopped Instagram message that includes the 410 area code.\n\"We're taking it very seriously, as we do every threat,\" Gamble said, adding that, through investigation, the Sheriff's Office doesn't think there is \"any viable threat to the safety\" of TCPS students.\nAccording to a letter from the district addressed to TCPS families, the district is \"closely monitoring the situation\" and working with local authorities. The letter says that school operations will continue as normal.\nGamble said a criminal investigation by the Sheriff's Office is underway. He said all school resource officers in the district are aware of the threat, and extra deputies are patrolling.\nOn Friday, TCPS students were put in a modified lockdown following a threatening social media post made that morning. According to the Sheriff's Office, the threat originated outside of the United States and similar threats were made to schools in Easton, Pennsylvania.\nGamble said the Sheriff's officer is aware of jurisdictions in other states that \"have had 40 or 50 of these types of threats.\"\n\"It's happening all over our country where, for whatever reason, somebody is trying to disrupt school operations and put our kids in fear,\" he said.\nGamble said that a few years back, the district experienced something similar where about half a dozen non-specific threats were made during the course of the school year. He said he would expect to see more of these threats this year.\n\"This just seems like the thing to do these days for some reason,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The incident involved three students and one staff member and ended with a student being transported to a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.According to a press release released by the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, the assault happened on Tuesday afternoon. The videos paint a picture of the incident, though no further official statement has been released by law enforcement on the assault.\nIn the videos, a group of students are circling around the three students involved in the assault. Seconds into the video, one student in a black hoodie moves toward a student in a red hoodie and assaults him. The student in red falls to the floor. Immediately following, an additional student in a gray hoodie proceeds to join in the assault.\nIn the video, a male staff member in a white shirt attempts to protect the student that is being assaulted and physically puts his body on top of the student, seemingly to act as a barrier between the students.\nThe other two students seemingly continue to assault the student in red and begin to also assault the staff member. Soon after, other staff members intervene and separate the students and defuse the situation. The incident lasted around 30 seconds.\nDeputies were able to identify two victims of the assault, one was an Easton High School staff member and the second was a student of the school. No identities have been released, and the incident is currently under investigation.\nThe assault resulted in one student being transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton via Talbot County Department of Emergency Services to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\nThe two other students in the video were identified and arrested in relation to the assault.\nAccording to a statement from Debbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools, the event is being evaluated and those involved will face appropriate disciplinary action.\n\"The safety of our students and staff is always our top priority. We are grateful for our partnership with the Talbot County Sheriff's Office and the presence of School Resource Officers in our schools,\" the statement said. \"Deputy Horseman, along with several other Sheriff's deputies and members of the Easton High staff responded quickly to contain the incident. The students involved will face appropriate disciplinary action, and we are continuously evaluating safety measures to prevent or mitigate incidents of this nature.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
