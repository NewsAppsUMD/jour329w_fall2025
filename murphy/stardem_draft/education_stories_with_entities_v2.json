She was elected president of the board in December 2020 and held the role through 2022.Moving forward, Delean-Botkin said she hopes the Board of Education continues to maintain the county's high graduation rate and low dropout rate, expand its Career and Technical Education completer courses and implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a statewide plan to increase public education funding, improve student outcomes and improve the quality of public education.\"The other big thing that we're very proud of is having as many students as wish to go ahead and take the Advanced Placement classes and exams,\" Delean-Botkin said.At a July 19 Talbot County Board of Education meeting, President Emily Jackson said the board wishes Delean-Botkin the best of luck.\"We will miss her words of wisdom and her guidance,\" Jackson said.Talbot County Public Schools Executive Assistant Charlene Gould said in an email that the governor's office has been notified of the vacancy and will appoint a new board member to fill Delean-Botkin's seat until elections in November 2024.She said interested candidates can submit an application to the Governor's Appointments Office.In June, Commissioners Tom Costigan and Jimmy Jaramillo appointed Delean-Botkin to fill Commissioner Brian Wells' seat.Wells resigned at the June 27 Commissioners of Oxford meeting. He said he was resigning because he was moving to Easton.Before being appointed, Delean-Botkin ran against and lost to now Commissioner Katrina Greer. Greer took the seat of Jaramillo, who did not seek reelection.Delean-Botkin said her new role as Oxford commissioner is a \"challenging\" one.\"I think what we have to look at is, Oxford a town of about 600 folks,\" she said.\"Three sides are surrounded by water, so we have limits on growth. People tend to want to move to Oxford because of the quality of life.Majority of people that I talk to do not want to see many things change. They want to maintain the integrity of the town.\" \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY MAGGIE TROVATO\n \nSusan Delean-Botkin has resigned from the Talbot County Board of Education. \n \n Memo: \"The other big thing that we're very proud of is having as many students as wish to go ahead and take the Advanced Placement classes and exams.\" - Susan Delean-Botkin \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Kent 4-H alumna Jill Bramble to lead National Council\n\n August 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Trish Mcgee; For The Star Democrat | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1501\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Jill Bramble, who says the lessons she learned in 4-H while growing up in Kent County informed her leadership mode, has ascended to the very top of the organization.She has been named president and CEO of the National 4-H Council, the private sector, nonprofit partner of Cooperative Extension's 4-H program that focuses on fundraising, brand management, communications, and legal and fiduciary services.Her first day in the new role is Aug. 18.Bramble's appointment followed an 18-month, externally led search. According to a news release, the National 4-H Council board of trustees was unanimous in its support of Bramble.She has spent nearly 20 years as a member of the National 4-H Council team, beginning as a grant writer, and is currently the executive vice president and chief growth officer.\"I am humbled and honored to have this opportunity,\" Bramble said in a telephone interview July 23. \"4-H did so much for me as a young person. I feel so fortunate to be a product of this organization and I want to give back.\" Bramble said she stands on the shoulders of many Kent County mentors, family and friends. Among those she listed by name are John Hall, who was the University of Maryland Extension agent during her youth, Laura Bradley, and the Debnam, Crow, Dulin, Lott, Moffett and Hill families.Bramble traces her 4-H lineage to great-grandmother Susan Clarkson Fry who was a volunteer and supported the program in Montgomery County.Maternal grandparents Edwin C. \"Pop\" and Lorraine Fry, and their four young children, moved to Fair Hill Farms, near Chestertown, in 1960.The Fry family continues to own and operate the dairy and grain farm. The youngsters in the family, Matt and Megan Fry's sons Reid and Owen, are Intermediate age 4-H'ers in the Kent Clover Calf Club.In the 1980s, as a member of the Kennedyville Blue Banner 4-H Club, Bramble was involved in dairy, public speaking and photography projects and the ambassador program.\"I was a complete failure in all the sewing projects,\" she said in the phone interview, good-naturedly poking fun at herself.Pat Hill, who was the club leader then, said she was pleased and proud - but not surprised - to learn of Bramble's promotion.As a youth, Bramble embraced the 4-H motto \"To make the best better,\" according to Hill.\"I think she's a role model for current 4-H members and all of Kent County youth.\" One of Hill's most treasured keepsakes is a counted cross-stitch 4-H emblem that Bramble made as a 4-H'er.Hill said she hangs that ornament on her Christmas tree every year.Another of Bramble's local supporters is Beth Hill, who has been the 4-H educator with University of Maryland Extension in Kent County for 28 years.\"It's amazing,\" Beth Hill said of Bramble's appointment.In an interview July 22, during the final night of the Kent County Fair, Beth Hill said: \"We're very proud that someone who had a passion for 4-H as a young person took that passion to the national level, helping kids across the country.\" She recalled that Bramble was invaluable in helping Kent 4-H meet the endowment challenge of raising $10,000 in five years.\"Jill met with me in my office (in 2006) and told me, 'You can do this,'\" Beth Hill said.Through car washes and bake sales and other events, Kent 4-H'ers raised the $10,000 in three years.Bramble's grandparents, the Frys, made the first donation.Today, the endowment is at $86,000, according to Beth Hill.Nonprofit leadership was not the original plan for Bramble, who graduated from the University of Colorado in 1993 with a degree in kinesiology as a step toward a possible career as a physical therapist.Instead, she returned to Kent County about the same time that a family member was diagnosed with breast cancer.She started out as a volunteer with the American Cancer Society and ultimately landed a job as income development director tasked with corporate and special event fundraising for the mid-Atlantic division.Bramble said that's when the proverbial light bulb went off in her head that the more resources and donations you raise, the more you can impact a mission.She credited the six years she spent with the Cancer Society for sparking her interest in nonprofit leadership.Bramble went back to school and earned a master's degree in nonprofit management from the University of Maryland in 2001.From there she joined Just Cause Consultants in Chestertown, where she flourished under the mentorship of Linda Walls in grant writing as well as learning the ins and outs of board development and strategic planning for nonprofits and funders.As Bramble and her husband Scott started their family - son Nick and daughter Jordan are now college graduates - she said she began to give serious thought about \"how kids grow and what is on their minds.\" In a stroke of good fortune, what Bramble described as \"serendipity,\" the National 4-H Council was advertising for a grant writer.She remembered thinking that after having had the opportunity as a youngster to grow through 4-H, she needed to \"pay it forward,\" and her excitement about leading nonprofits made this an ideal opportunity for her.Hired in May 2005, she has spent the past 18 years and three months with the National 4-H Council.As a senior vice president and chief development officer, Bramble led the national resource development team that advances strategic individual, corporate and foundation partnerships in support of the 4-H mission.In March 2022, she was elevated to executive vice president and chief growth officer.Bramble said part of what drives her is the ideal that all youth have access to the opportunities that 4-H offers, which include growing life skills like confidence, independence, resilience and compassion.4-H is America's largest youth development organization, with six million boys and girls ages 5 to 19 and 600,000 volunteers nationwide.The origin of 4-H dates to the turn of the 20th century, and was first called a Corn Club because agriculture was then the leading industry.While ag is still very much a part pf 4-H, the organization is expanding to include robotics, coding, engineering and even artificial intelligence.Bramble said 4-H is a microcosm of America, and what people see locally differs in each community.For example, in the inner city of Dallas, Texas, the program is focused on technology and AI.\"I don't want to take away from how critical agriculture is - it provides food, clothing and housing - but 4-H is more than that,\" Bramble said. \"It is to encourage kids to take on leadership roles and engage them in their communities.\" Bramble said she has witnessed firsthand the transformative power of 4-H programs.\"As the leader of the National 4-H Council, I will spend every single day ensuring all kids have access to the powerful, life-changing outcomes that I experienced in my own childhood,\" she said in a news release.\"I have endless faith in the leadership of the next generation if we give them the tools they need to be successful,\" she said, adding that her role \"will be to empower Cooperative Extension 4-H educators to help America's youth reach their full potential.\" In announcing Bramble's appointment, the National 4-H Council noted her 18 years of successful leadership experience at the organization and a deep commitment to its mission, values and goals.Throughout her time with the National 4-H Council, Bramble \"has consistently demonstrated her dedication to empowering young people, fostering innovation, and strengthening partnerships,\" the organization stated in a news release. \"Her strategic insights, collaborative approach, and passion for positive youth development make her the ideal candidate to lead the National 4-H Council into its next phase of growth and impact.\" Bramble succeeds Jennifer Sirangelo, who is leaving after 10 years as president and CEO to lead Points of Light.\"While it's hard to step away from 4-H,\" Sirangelo said in a news release, \"this transition is easier knowing that Jill will be National 4-H Council's next leader. Jill is the best person for this role. I have the utmost confidence in her and know the future is bright with her at the helm.\" Bramble will be able to continue to work remotely from her home in Bluffton, South Carolina, while spending one week a month at headquarters in Washington.She extended an open invitation to Kent County residents, current 4-H'ers and 4-H alumni to visit whenever she is in D.C.Kent County will always be \"home,\" said Bramble, who has family and friends still living here.She said she hopes that in her new position she can continue to give back to Kent County. \n \n Caption: JILL BRAMBLE\n \nCONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nWhile growing up in Kent County, Jill Bramble was a member of the Kennedyville Blue Banner 4-H Club, where she was involved in dairy, public speaking and photography projects and the ambassador program.\n \nCONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nA teenaged Jill Bramble is pictured with Peppermint Patty, her first 4-H project, given to her by her grandfather Edwin C. \"Pop\" Fry when she was 8 years old and the cow was just a calf. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Library will host a ribbon-cutting and dedication ceremony at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 8, welcoming all community members to come out and experience the expanded facilities.This expansion effort has been a joint effort of the State of Maryland, the Maryland State Library Agency, Queen Anne's County Commissioners, and citizens and Library friends advocating for the needed addition of spaces in the Branch. This expansion culminated in the creation of innovative community meeting rooms, a welcoming lobby area, and a state-of-the-art Makerspace designed to inspire creativity and facilitate learning.\"These additions to our Library mark an important step forward in our commitment to serve our community,\" said Janet Salazar, Queen Anne's County Library director. \"Our expanded spaces aim to foster deeper connections, broaden intellectual horizons, and facilitate the sharing of ideas in an increasingly interconnected world.\" The community meeting rooms are equipped with modern audio-visual technology to enable high-quality presentations, discussions, workshops, and other events. The inviting lobby will act as a hub of social interaction, encouraging community members to connect, collaborate and engage.Perhaps the most exciting feature of this expansion is the Makerspace, an interactive area equipped with a range of tools and equipment, such as 3D printers, laser engravers, vinyl printers and cutters, sewing machines, and crafting materials, designed to inspire innovation and creativity. The Makerspace is set to become a platform for local inventors, entrepreneurs, students and hobbyists to bring their ideas to life.The ribbon-cutting ceremony on Aug. 8 will officially open these spaces to the public. Following the event, library staff will be on hand to give tours of the new facilities and demonstrate the features of the Makerspace.The Kent Island Branch of Queen Anne's County Library is grateful for the community's support and participation in the creation of these spaces and warmly welcomes everyone to join us celebrating this important milestone. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nQueen Anne's County Library invites community to celebrate the dedication of the renovated Kent Island Branch with ribbon-cutting ceremony on Aug. 8. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was later the academic and career adviser guiding students through actionable plans to achieve their goals.A native of Costa Rica, Solano came to the United States as a graduate student.After earning her bachelor's degree in Costa Rica, she worked for an international flower exporter as she continued her studies toward licensure at the University of Costa Rica.Her future plans took a turn when a professor at the university asked if she was adventurous.Thinking that the professor meant bungee jumping or some other daredevil sport, Solano prepared to decline. Instead, the professor asked if she would be interested in taking on a new academic challenge in a different country. He recommended her for a graduate research post at the University of Maryland.While working on \"green\" roof research and earning her master's degree in natural resources science at College Park, Solano's interest grew in building sustainable communities through policy and education.She went on to earn a Ph.D.in public policy and urban affairs at the University of Delaware.\"It's ironic that I studied urban affairs and ended up in a rural area,\" Solano said. \"Rural and urban areas face many of the same challenges, though, and people in both areas want the same things.\" Better lives and a greater sense of community, Solano said, are common desires for most people.The Cambridge Center provides both, she added. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED.\n \nLorelly Solano is the new director of the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The event drew about 2,100 participants.The annual event, organized and run by volunteers, has grown into one of the state's largest ride and has helped to raise more than $2 million with 15,000 participates since the ride's inception in 2001. Now, much more than a ride, Chrome City is a way for the community to learn more about Benedictine's mission to help children and adults with developmental disabilities achieve their greatest potential.The school serves students from the entire Mid-Atlantic region, including Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Virginia.Each year students dance along with Rockin' Elvis and riders and participants vie for the Sister's Choice award. This year an orange HD Turbo Road King was the grand prize winning bike, and Ray Nails with a red and silver 1954 Pontiac Star Chief was the grand prize car winner. New this year was the Kid's Choice awards given to Donald Teat in a national grand champion Huckster and Mike Ledbetter in his Harley Davidson motorcycle.For the first time in the event's history, Benedictine auctioned off a donated-signed Paul Reed Smith electric guitar with all proceeds going to benefit the organization.\"We are honored to have so many car enthusiasts from all over the state come to support the kids each year,\" said Spud Blake, Chrome City Ride volunteer chair. \"This is an event where our kids love seeing the cars and motorcycles. They interact with the various owners.The owners take a lot of great individual time to show the kids what is special about their cars and motorcycles.\" Generous sponsors, community partners, and volunteers continue to make the event a success year after year. Blake thanked CPR Vintage Porsche Restoration in Easton for helping to promote the event and serving as a registration location as well as Outback Steakhouse in Annapolis, Rommel Harley-Davidson Delmarva of Salisbury, Old Glory Harley-Davidson dealership, and Hitchcock Autoworks for serving as registration locations and rally points.Volunteers from Callahan's Gas and Appliance in Centreville helped with parking the hundreds of cars on campus, along with volunteers from Choptank Transport in Preston.Each rider passed under a large American flag at Benedictine's front entrance waving from a ladder truck. Famous Dave's provided a hot barbecue lunch, and each rider took home a collectible T-shirt printed and designed by Benedictine's Graphics department.Notable attendees in years past include Candy Clark, Cindy Williams and Bo Hopkins from the George Lucas 1973 classic American Graffiti, as well as area legislators. The event has attracted celebrity donors as well. For more than five years car enthusiast and talk show host Jay Leno donated to the event, as well as a collector from New Jersey who donated a 1941 Willys Pro Street Coupe in 2016. This year's 2019 event bought the largest crowd of riders and spectators to date.At the beginning of 2018, the Benedictine School earned a two-year accreditation through 2020 from the National Commission for the Accreditation of Special Education Services.The accreditation placed the Benedictine School among 26 institutions in the nation to receive the honor out of about 200 special education schools.As a national commission that verifies and promotes excellence in education service, NCASES evaluates private special education programs through a process that encourages diversity of educational practice and innovation. The process assures students in private special education settings are provided environments that are healthy, safe, comfortable and conducive to learning.NCASES also named Benedictine School teacher Lorraine Slama the 2018 Educator of the Year.For more information about the Benedictine School, visit www.benschool.org.@Kayla StarDem \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO/\n \nMotorcycles thundered down the mile-long lane onto the Benedictine School campus during the 18th annual Chrome City Ride in Ridgely Sunday, July 28.\n \nPHOTO BY KAY LA RIVAS/\n \nMore than 2,100 classic cars, street rods and motorcycles from six rally points across Maryland and Delaware thundered onto the Benedictine campus on Sunday, July 28, for Chrome City Ride.

As she enters her senior year with a typical mix of excitement and nervousness, she is looking after graduation at studying animal science with a minor in equine science.Macrina Zbobysz, 14, of Preston, won the fair princess pageant, and she did archery as her talent for the competition, sending three arrows downrange to a target 20 meters away with impressive accuracy and poise.Macrina, a homeschooler, has participated in 4-H for seven years, and enjoys participating in the archery club, a pursuit she said taught her persistence and focus on a goal.The newly crowned princess's mom, Jill Zbobysz, said her family got involved in 4-H for the community atmosphere and the education it offers kids.\"It cultivates them as an individual,\" Jill said. \"Good kids, good families, it's just wonderful.Macrina said she is preparing for her first participation in the upcoming statewide archery competition, an event that places the targets at 60 meters. Her initial goal for the first year in the senior division is to place in the top ten.Lily Hutchison took home the first place ribbon in the working weather goat show on Aug. 3, with her Oberhasli goat Honey Dude towing the four she made with her dad, Danny.Lily, an 8-year-old rising third grader from Ridgely, just finished her first year in 4-H.\"She's learned responsibility, she's learned how to take care of an animal. She's learned that if she gives love and attention to that animal, she will in turn get love and attention from that animal,\" said Lily's mom, Jana.Hutchison.Lily has a horse and two goats in addition to Honey Dude. \"She love her goats,\" Jana said with a laugh.Outgoing fair Queen Rebecca Brault said she enjoyed her yearlong reign, particularly the chance to do interviews and public relations work about 4-H and what it has meant to her.\"4-H for me is such a growth opportunity,\" Brault said, explaining that when she started she hated public speaking and being in front of people. In addition to helping her enjoy those things, she has learned other practical skills like sewing and photography.Brault, who was homeschooled and is preparing to further her education, said the fair embodies and gives a platform to the good things that 4-H offers.Rebecca's mom, Christina Brault, said her daughter always enjoyed promoting 4-H, so the time spent as the fair queen was a role that came naturally.\"It's definitely given her a lot more poise, she's more well-spoken than a lot of kids her age and she's got a wide variety of interests that I thank 4-H for,\" Christina said.In a societal climate of busy lifestyles, Christina encouraged parents to invest the time in getting their kids involved: \"You will get as much out of it as your child does.\" \"I believe that for the youth it's a bonding experience.They're here, they cheer each other on, there's not a cliquey feeling. There's just a lot of education, and it's done in a fun way,\" she said. \n \n Caption: DUSTIN HOLT/FOR TIMES-RECORD\n \nThe Caroline/Dorchester County Fair crowned its royal court on opening night Wednesday, Aug. 2.

    "content": "School district saves thousands in energy costs - Program focuses on use and use reduction\n\n August 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 17 | Section: News \n \n 581\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - Efforts by Caroline County Public Schools to reduce energy costs have resulted in almost $260,000 in savings as a result of a yearlong program managed by Cenergistic, an energy conservation company based in Dallas, Texas.Reporting at the Aug. 1 meeting of the Caroline County Board of Education, Cenergistic Client Manager Scott Muir shared a slide show depicting how the program has saved the school district money since July 1, 2022.School board president Richard Barton called the first annual report \"really exciting stuff.\" \"I've just got to give you guys big kudos,\" Muir said. \"This is one of the fastest and most successful starts to a program that I've seen.\" Muir and Superintendent Dr.Derek Simmons credited Cenergistic Energy specialist Josh Rein for his work in the district.\"Having Josh here from the very beginning\" was beneficial, Muir said. \"Typically we do have a challenge hiring an energy specialist from outside the district, so they have to develop all these relationships and try and do it quickly. And we just got off to a great start with him already knowing everyone here.\" Cenergistic created the energy conservation program that \"assists in minimizing the impact that cost increases has on the budget,\" according to the report. Four energy sources were considered: electricity, solar, heating oil and propane.The lion's share of cost increases was from electricity the school district buys from the grid at a 64% increase and heating oil with a 42% increase.\"There's not a whole lot we can do about the costs, so our company focuses on use and use reduction,\" Muir said.Relying on solar and setting back thermostats on weekends, nights and during the summer made a difference, Muir said.From July 2022 through June 2023, 80% of CCPS's utility spending was on electricity.\"That's a huge area of focus for Josh and our team,\" Muir said.However, even with the increases in energy costs, the public schools decreased energy use intensity (EUI) by 35%. Energy use intensity is a measure of 1,000 BTUs of energy per square foot, \"a benchmark that the EPA uses,\" Muir said. It's also used for Energy Star certification.\"It's a way of measuring elementary schools against other elementary schools, houses against houses, and the regional average here for K12 schools is 54 EUI,\" Muir said. \"When we started the program, you actually were doing pretty well; you were already at 50 EDI. And today, for the last 12 months, we're down to 32 EUI. So at that at that level, our company is going to be looking at getting certified for Energy Star for a lot of facilities.\" An \"energy savings day\" on Monday July 3, \"was a great little initiative and the results show,\" Muir said.Rein performed more than 1,516 building audits, \"and that equates to 1,451 metric tons of CO2 emissions avoided,\" Muir said. \"That's a huge environmental footprint.\" Muir compared the 1,451 metric tons of CO2, equating them to \"over 3.5 million miles driven by an average car,\" he said. \"That amount of energy can power 175 homes for the year.\" Cenergistic has a five-year contract with the Caroline County Public Schools.\"The message to the taxpayer is (our) more efficient use of money, and that's something you don't hear government say very often,\" Barton said.To view the full report, visit https://go.boarddocs.com/mabe/carps/Board.nsf/Public, open the Aug. 1 agenda and click on the \"Cenergistic Update\" link. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/TIMES RECORD\n \nCenergistic Client Manager Scott Muir shared a slide show depicting how the program has saved the school district over $250,000 since July 1, 2022 \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In the coming months, Cambridge residents are likely to meet Solano as she begins her community outreach efforts.The Cambridge Center, Solano said, is a resource for everyone in Dorchester County, playing a critical role in the economic and social health of the downtown area.In addition to credit classes in both transfer and career programs, the center also offers workforce training, personal enrichment opportunities and meeting spaces for community organizations. The center also houses the American Job Center.\"We're an education center for students of all ages, but I hope residents here also see us as a center of community growth,\" Solano said.Solano first joined Chesapeake as an English as a Second Language instructor.She was later the academic and career advisor guiding students through actionable plans to achieve their goals.A native of Costa Rica, Solano came to the United States as a graduate student.After earning her bachelor's degree in Costa Rica, she worked for an international flower exporter as she continued her studies toward licensure at the University of Costa Rica.Her future plans took a turn when a professor at UCR asked if she was adventurous.Thinking that the professor meant bungee jumping or some other daredevil sport, Solano prepared to decline. Instead, the professor asked if she would be interested in taking on a new academic challenge in a different country.He recommended her for a graduate research post at the University of Maryland.While working on \"green\" roof research and earning her master's degree in natural resources science at College Park, Solano's interest grew in building sustainable communities through policy and education.She went on to earn a Ph.D. in public policy and urban affairs at the University of Delaware.\"It's ironic that I studied urban affairs and ended up in rural area,\" Solano said. \"Rural and urban areas face many of the same challenges, though, and people in both areas want the same things.\" Better lives and a greater sense of community, Solano said, are common desires for most people. The Cambridge Center provides both, she added.For more information about the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center, please visit www.chesapeake.edu/cambridge. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nDr. Lorelly Solano is the new director of the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mid-Shore Pro Bono interns gain valuable experience\n\n August 17, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Detmer; mdetmer@chespub.com | Page: A2 | Section: News \n \n 1673\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - As the summer academic break enters its final phase, three Maryland students working as interns at Mid-Shore Pro Bono this summer reflected on their experiences thus far.Clay Benedict of Baltimore, James Parkinson of Oxford, and Gabrielle Shlikas were selected as the nonprofit's summer 2023 interns.Benedict is a legal intern through the University of Baltimore School of Law's EXPLOR program.The program ensures that all law students obtain a legal internship during the summer after their first year, with participating employers accepting one law student or more selected by the program.Parkinson is an intern and Shlikas is a legal intern through MSPB's Sandy Brown Public Interest internship program.The paid internship program was established to honor MSPB's previous executive director Sandy Brown and is supported by individual donors and the Campbell Foundation.The donor-funded program provides undergraduate and law school students with a stipend while learning in the areas of public interest law, nonprofit management, community service and basic work experience.CLAY BENEDICTClay Benedict is a 2025 Juris Doctor candidate at the University of Baltimore School of Law.Born in Baton Rouge, he holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science from Louisiana State University, where he served as Secretary for the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity.Benedict served in the U.S. Army Infantry out of Fort Polk, Louisiana, working as a Battalion Property Manager and directly with the Commander.\"Working as an MSPB legal intern has been a humbling experience that has allowed me to interact with real people facing prevalent yet overlooked legal issues,\" Benedict said. \"Statistics, articles and just basic common knowledge about the disparity in legal aid and legal knowledge between those with resources and those without, is one thing; but here, I get to see those statistics unfold before my eyes, both inside and outside the courtroom.\" \"I decided to intern at MSPB because I was offered the opportunity to observe and learn firsthand the inner working procedures and processes, consequences, and defenses involved in a vast array of legal issues that affect everyday people,\" Benedict said. \"Whether it be representing tenants in rent court, helping draft wills, helping people overcome their debt, or helping people with internal family matters, there was something here for me to learn.\" Over the course of the summer, he has observed meetings between the attorneys and their clients in the realms of rent court hearings, estate planning and other family matters.Benedict also works part time at a personal injury firm, where he drafts complaints, interrogatories and case summaries, and where he conducts legal research for specific questions or trial related issues.Benedict said his work in the elder law clinic really stands out to him.\"Not only was it interesting and nice to get to meet so many people and hear their stories, but it was also very productive in terms of being able to assess someone's problem and then put it on a path of satisfactory resolution in the span of one simple meeting,\" Benedict said.\"So many people, when dealing with planning for their death or with the death or incapacitation of a family member, have no idea what is going on or what they need to do, so it's really fulfilling helping them work through these critical moments of their lives.\" With his sights set on graduating and passing the bar, Benedict has a flexible view of what legal field he might work in. \"I am not too concerned with respect to what kind of law I would like to practice, so long as I am able to conduct research, write, and argue in a stable, longterm setting,\" he said.JAMES PARKINSONJames Parkinson grew up in Easton and graduated from Easton High School in 2020. He is pursuing his Bachelor of Arts in Government and Politics with a minor in History from the University of Maryland, College Park, where his academic honors have earned him membership in the Pi Sigma Alpha National Political Science Honor Society.His academics earned him a Fall 2022 University Honors College Citation and acceptance into the Government and Politics Honors Program.Parkinson currently is serving as a Maryland General Assembly Intern and Legislative Assistant with Delegate Steven J. Arentz, and previously served as a District Office Intern and Legislative Assistant with Delegate Johnny Mautz. He is the captain and goalkeeper of the University of Maryland Club Soccer Team's red squad.\"Interning with Mid-Shore Pro Bono this summer has allowed me to work alongside dedicated legal professionals and attorneys, whose common goal of serving the Eastern Shore community has been a source of constant inspiration,\" Parkinson said. \"Through learning about our client intake process and helping with in-person clinics, I have gained a better understanding of the intricacies of legal work outside the courtroom. I have also been able to attend court proceedings with a dynamic team focused on housing justice on the Lower Shore.\" This summer, Parkinson has learned about three areas of law: elder, family and housing. He has found some of his duties, like doing intakes for new clients, are not specific to one area of law, but a bulk of his work corresponds to one of these three areas.Parkinson has helped in scheduling clients for our elder law clinics, and assisted MSPB volunteer attorneys as they draft wills and other legal documents, like power of attorney forms or advance medical directives. In the area of housing law, he has gone to court with the MSPB staff attorney and paralegal from the Salisbury office, helping tenants in rent court with a variety of legal issues. His experience in family law matters has mostly been doing intakes, connecting people to our network of volunteer attorneys.\"My experience in housing court has been the highlight of my summer experience. Prior to this internship, I had never seen the inside of a courtroom, and I now feel comfortable in the Dorchester and Wicomico District courthouses. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with our housing team as they represent clients in landlord versus tenant cases - they are dedicated to working towards greater housing justice on the Eastern Shore.\" Parkinson plans to attend law school after graduation.GABRIELLE SHLIKASGabrielle Shlikas is a 2025 J.D. candidate and a Christine A. Edwards Dean's Scholar at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. Her time at the Carey School of Law includes serving as a student member of the Administrative Committee, as an event moderator with the Business Association, as a student representative of the Admissions Office, and as a member of the Women's Bar Association.Shlikas graduated cum laude from Wellesley College with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and English, where she was a Tanner Conference speaker and graduated from the She Should Run Program. She is an Alumnae Member of The Wellesley Fund, having served as a Philanthropy Team Supervisor, Candidacy Exploration Researcher, and Residential Assistant.Shlikas received a diploma from the International Baccalaureate Program and additionally has served as a Senate Page with the Maryland General Assembly and as an Executive Board Member of the Maryland Youth Advisory Council.\"Working at MSPB has been an amazing experience - I've learned so much not only about the law itself but how to conduct myself as a legal professional,\" Shlikas said.\"With MSPB, I've had the privilege of helping those in my community through a variety of problems, questions, and situations.I wanted to be an MSPB Intern because I wanted to do work that directly impacted the area I call home, and doing so this summer has been extremely rewarding.\" After graduation, Shlikas anticipates working in business law, with an eventual goal of practicing family and divorce law.Shlikas described her work this summer as \"absolutely fantastic.\" \"There's been a lot of opportunity for me to get practical experience and see lawyers doing work.Some of the most informative experiences have been her weekly work in rent court, the legal venue for disputes between landlords and tenants, primarily regarding potential evictions. \"It's been amazing to see the amount of people who don't know that they have rights in the situation, or don't realize that there are a lot of ways their issue can be resolved without them being evicted.\" Shlikas has also worked with the expungement clinic, a service more in demand due to recent changes in state law about cannabis-related convictions.One impactful experience of the summer for Shlikas was helping a man get expungements on multiple convictions ranging back decades. The man told Shlikas the convictions had kept him from applying from certain types of jobs, and that he was excited about his expanded employment opportunities.Additionally, Shlikas found it rewarding to help tenants expecting to be evicted because they were with oldling their rent because of concerns with the liveability of the property they rented to find a resolution through the legal process that included those necessary improvements being made.\"It's been great to be exposed to all of these areas of law,\" Shlikas said.MID-SHORE PRO BONO INTERN OPPORTUNITIES\"We're honored to have Clay, James, and Gabrielle continuing their educations with us,\" said Mid-Shore Pro Bono Executive Director Meredith Lathbury Girard. \"We're also grateful for the University of Baltimore School of Law's EXPLOR program and especially for the donors to our Sandy Brown Public Interest Internship fund that help underwrite stipends for our interns.\" Girard said the nonprofit is uniquely positioned to expose students who are interested in the practice of law, social work and public interest work through hands-on experiences working with rural populations lacking the same resources as urban areas.\"This program engages students in a wide range of legal-related experiences in a high quality and well-supervised professional setting,\" she said. \"And undergraduate students interested in law, justice, and criminal justice as well as other civic-minded careers will be exposed to hands-on experience in these areas as well.\" Mid-Shore Pro Bono connects Eastern Shore individuals and families in need of legal representation with volunteer attorneys to ensure that all can have access to the assistance needed, with offices in Easton and Salisbury.

There were also 25 vendors in the shade near the pavilion giving out all kinds of free items like sunglasses and bucket hats and, more importantly, information about the services they offer. This diverse community networking event was put on by For All Seasons.It was a family-centric back-to-school crowd. While the rock trio Brookletts played Jimi Hendrix and Santana and Bossa Nova, children played with hulahoops and got free Rita's Italian Ice in three flavors: mango, cherry and blue raspberry.Their tongues revealed their flavor preferences.John Qvarnstrom, marketing and communications associate at For All Seasons, said, \"What is great about today is we have been able to successfully bring together 25 different organizations in our community and give away over 800 backpacks to families - all in the space of one hour.Every year we have been growing and this only shows that our community wants this here. And we are going to keep rising to meet their demand.\" He also had some positive metrics of this event's second year to share.\"We had 400 blue bags, which is one per family so they can put all their supplies in.We ordered enough popcorn for 800 people.Going back to school is something a community does; it is not one family; it is not one business; it is not even one school.It is all of us together. People and families these days are hurting. They need these supplies. We make it so every kid, regardless of socio economic status, can start the school year on their best foot,\" Qvarnstrom said.He added they had about 20 volunteers, all wearing blue shirts. Volunteers were translating, scooping Italian ice, handing out popcorn and even handing out bottles of icy water.Katie Theeke, vice president of marketing and communications at For All Seasons, said that all her volunteers showed up on time and did an amazing job putting everything together.\"Everyone is relaxed and enjoying each other's company. This is really an event about community. We gave over 665 backpacks away. People show up if you find the right way to share the message out in the community.It feels great to see this many people together and getting what they need,\" Theeke said.The event was a melting pot for the community.\"It is great to see people from all different communities across the Shore show up together. It is a very diverse population tonight, and everybody is having a blast,\" Theeke said.The amount of information and services made available was staggering.They had mental health services, groups addressing food insecurity, Boy Scouts, translation help for Hispanics and more. High Point Church was there sharing its community. Easton Mayor Megan Cooke was there with her team from Care Packs, which feeds food insecure students in the public school system. The Talbot County Public Library had a booth, and volunteers guessed they had enlisted 100 new free members.Janine Puma Martinez, translator for For All Seasons, would like to see the event, which already grew by 50% from last year, get even bigger.\"This shouldn't be the only outreach event. More of our outreach agencies should collaborate together.There is always somebody out there that needs that helping hand or that needs a smile to get them out of that way of thinking like those thoughts of ending their precious lives,\" Martinez said.This colorful event was full of smiles and neighbors saying hello to each other - in addition to backpacks, pencils and library cards. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY TOM MCCALL/TMCCALL@CHESPUB.COM\n \nFrom left, Royalti Hall, 2, Taliah Baker, 10, and Ah'mir Dodd, 10, get free backpacks and hats.

Considered by many to be a cornerstone of Plato's work, the dialogue explores two central questions: First, what is justice, and secondly, is the just person happier than the unjust person? or what is the relation of justice to happiness?Participants will explore these questions through guided discussions and selected readings. After Hansen's class on Meno last term, one student remarked, \"I learned as much from the participants and Forest, as Plato and Socrates!\" Hansen earned a BA in English at Harvard, an MA in English at the University of Wisconsin, and a Ph.D. in Philosophy at Johns Hopkins.For more than 35 years he taught a variety of courses in English and philosophy, as well as courses in Greek Civilization, Classics in Western Thought, and more.Plato's Republic is four-sessions, Wednesdays, Sept. 6, 13, 20 and 27, from 10 to 11:30 a.m. Cost: $40.Zoom only.If philosophy doesn't ring your bell, may birding will. In \"Restoration Earns Its Wings: Birds of Poplar Island,\" Kristina Motley and Tim Carney with the Maryland Environmental Service, along with our favorite CF birder Wayne Bell, lead a hybrid classroom/field trip to the barrier island to check up on its burgeoning bird population. We'll start with a classroom session with Motley and Carney, followed a week later with a birding field trip over to the island where Bell will join us as well.So far, more than 400 acres of wetlands have been restored on Poplar Island.This restoration supports over 250 different species of birds that have been documented on or just offshore and over 40 different bird species that have been confirmed as nesting onsite.Motley, is a Senior Environmental Specialist with the Maryland Environmental Service, where she has worked on the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island for the past five years.\"Restoration Earns Its Wings: Birds of Poplar Island\" is two sessions, Wednesday, Sept. 6, from 10-11:30 a.m. Hybrid (Zoom, in person at the Easton Family YMCA or recording). The field trip to Popular Island will be from 9 a.m. to noon Sept. 13. Cost: $30. You can also choose to skip the field trip and participate in a classroom-only session for $20.Finally, round out the week with \"Healthy Living, Healthy Brain\" on Sept. 7.For centuries, we've known that the health of the brain and the body are connected.But now, science is able to provide insights into how to make lifestyle choices that may help you keep your brain and body healthy as you age.Join client care manager Jane Bateman to learn about research in the areas of diet and nutrition, exercise, cognitive activity, and social engagement, and use hands-on tools to help you incorporate these recommendations into a plan for healthy aging.Jane Bateman has been a client care manager since 2012.

    "content": "Governor visits Benedictine\n\n August 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom Mccall; tmccall@chespub.com | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 857\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY - Gov. Wes Moore visited the Benedictine campus on Aug. 17. Although a phalanx of elected officials showed up, he seemed most enthused with the students he met. He even high-fived a couple and returned a \"peace out\" hand gesture in kind.He was joined by Maryland Department of Disabilities Secretary Carol Beatty.The campus was the governor's first stop through the Eastern Shore as he attended the annual Maryland Association of Counties summer conference.\"It was my privilege to visit Benedictine Programs and Services and witness firsthand the amazing work being done by the staff that is crucial to the success of our students,\" Moore said. \"The caring leadership of Director Scott Evans and Educational Director Julie Hickey aligns with our administration's mission to leave no one behind. I thank them for their admirable work toward this vital goal.\" Beatty believes strongly in the Benedictine mission.\"This is a critical organization for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in our state,\" Beatty said. \"A lot of the school systems look to a school like this for assistance and support for their students.They also have a very vibrant adult service program.So they are training people to work.\" Benedictine Programs and Services offers a year-round educational residential program for students throughout Maryland, ages 5-21, as well as adjoining states, and an expansion is set for the facility with the support of a $1.5 million capital grant in fiscal year 2023 budget.The funding will be used for the construction and engineering costs associated with building a new student residential building. The fiscal year 2024 capital budget included an additional $2.5 million for the campus project.\"It was an honor to host Gov. Moore at our campus in Ridgely. We had the opportunity to tour our facility, where the governor met students, teachers and our supported adults,\" Evans said.\"We thank the governor and his staff for taking the time to learn about what we do here at Benedictine in fulfilling our mission to help the individuals we support achieve their greatest potential and highest level of independence,\" he added.They took Moore into a classroom where two students were learning about pirates. The super-engaged teacher of functional academics was Leslie Nelson.The governor jumped right into the lesson and gave high fives for correct answers.One unscripted moment happened in a hallway when Moore approached two parents who had just left their son Jake off at Benedictine for his first time. Peggy was in tears, partly out of leaving her son and partly of gratitude to Benedictine for the \"golden ticket\" their family had received to enroll him.Moore consoled and celebrated with her and gave her a hug.Benedictine has students from 16 different counties and several states including Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia. Evans said most of the students from Maryland are publicly funded. Benedictine currently has room for 36 residential students on campus and is looking with the expansion to get to 48.\"A lot of what we get is what public schools can't handle. So we set up an environment so they can be safe as they are learning and we are helping them to manage those behaviors and learn new ways,\" Hickey said.\"That is really what our goal is. Last year we had 148 referrals, and we have taken 12.\" A tough issue is attracting the best teachers. One classroom had two students, one teacher and two assistants.It is intense and rewarding work that pays about as much as Applebee's. It is about as hard to get a placement as getting into an Ivy League college. One state-level fix is the service year option that could get younger workers involved with this meaningful work. Evans called this work life changing.Benedictine is a non-sectarian, non-religious nonprofit organization supporting close to 200 children and adults with developmental disabilities and autism to achieve their greatest potential and highest level of independence. Benedictine's year-round educational program is one of only 22 nationwide to earn a two-year accreditation from the National Commission for Accreditation of Special Education Services.Benedictine's Adult Services program offers employment and vocational services for transitional youth and adults, ages 22 to 70 and beyond, in the community and those who live in Benedictine's group homes in Caroline, Talbot and Anne Arundel counties. Benedictine is one of only four residential facilities for the developmentally disabled and autistic that can accept students with moderate to severe challenges.Benedictine is one of the Eastern Shore's largest employers with 350 employees. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY TOM MCCALL/TMCCALL@CHESPUB.COM\n \nGov.

    "content": "School lunches - yesterday and today\n\n August 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Marie Savage; The Country Cook | Page: A18 | Section: News \n \n 1204\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n School will be opening shortly and I decided to go back in time for that ever-important break in the school day - lunch. Everyone is \"starving\" by lunchtime especially the ones who had no breakfast.My mom had that big pot of oatmeal ready, and she made sure we had a bowl of it! I am exploring the 1940s when my older brothers and sister went to school. Mom always had at least three or more children in school and would pack their lunches.Lunches were packed in round tin pails with handles or the ever-popular generational brown bag. Their lunch would consist of a biscuit with a piece of meat or maybe a piece of cornbread with leftover meat from supper the night before.Water from school to drink, an apple or whatever was available and in season. When they got home from school there would be a snack consisting of fruit or leftovers from the night before.The 1940s-style cafeteria in the little Bishopville school was part of a six-room school consisting of four classrooms (two grades per room), two bathrooms (one male and one female), one multipurpose room - cafeteria-gym-auditorium-meeting room - and a storage room for everything from toilet tissue to chalk to cleaning supplies to canned goods! Then came the 1950s with changes to the school that included a large room converted to a cafeteria complete with a big cook stove, an actual cook, tables and chairs, but the room still converted to a gym, auditorium and meeting room.If you bought lunch, the food was placed on the ugliest dark brown, heavy plastic tray ever. No matter what food you were served that day there was a small dish of applesauce on the corner of the tray. The dessert was usually a small square of brownie, gingerbread, square of yellow sheet cake with frosting or a small bowl of Jello. The late Mrs. Lynch was our cook who lived locally and whose car was parked there every morning about 6 a.m. Mrs. Lynch and Mr. Hudson, the custodian, were employed there for many years. The only other part-timer was \"Albert,\" a local boy who helped peel vegetables, carry heavy pots, scrub down tables, whatever Mrs.Lynch needed help with, AND he ate lunch with us and pushed us on the swings! We all dearly loved the \"workers\" at our little country school!Attending this school from first grade through sixth, we packed lunches and occasionally bought lunch. Foods packed were usually leftovers from supper the night before.One popular sandwich was a meatloaf sandwich. It seemed no matter what the main sandwich was, the sides were always a fat dill pickle, a few chips, and a cookie with water. In the 1940s and '50s other popular packed lunches were potted meat, tuna fish, peanut butter and jelly, bologna and cheese sandwiches, any kind of leftover supper meat from the night before, and I cannot forget the popular Spam sandwich.On a cold wintry morning Mrs. Lynch would have several large pots of vegetable or bean soup cooking and the delicious aroma would travel all over the school. The only aroma that was better was the one of tomato soup and grilled cheese!Then came the late 1950s and the early 1960s! We left our little country school to go to the \"big school\" - high school - which for us was Stephen Decatur. Here we met up with many more \"city kids\" than ever. The country kids, the city kids all blended in together and compared our lifestyles. One thing we all had in common, we were starving at lunchtime! I must share this lunch story with you. Several girls and I became close friends and remained so for many years. \"Nellie\" was from Berlin, \"Sue\" was from Ocean City, \"Sandy\" was from St. Martins and then me from Bishopville.We sat at the same table every day and we usually packed lunch every day - usually consisting of leftovers from the night before. I had a meatloaf sandwich, Sandy had tuna fish, and Sue had lunch meat with cheese. We were busy chatting and eating when I looked over at Nellie, whose brown bag was stained on the outside. I asked Nellie \"what did you bring?\" Nellie said \"leftover fried beef tongue\" from last night - the three of us screamed, jumped up and ran gagging to the bathroom!Then came my children going to school in the 1970s and 1980s. School cafeterias had changed greatly by this time. In middle school there was a jukebox, round tables as well as the long style and a \"huge\" change in school food.Some lunches were spaghetti with meatballs, garlic bread and a salad. There were submarines with small bags of chips, and the ever popular \"a la carte\" foods. You could purchase candy bars, ice cream, individual sandwiches and add a bowl of soup. Lunch boxes turned into lunch bags or insulated bags.Packed lunches in the '80s and '90s included foods like beef jerky, cheese sticks, hot chips and pop-top cans of soups. Lunch had very few sandwiches as students would buy lunch on \"pizza days\" and \"taco days.\" Potato bars, taco bars, Lunchables, Chef Boyardee pop top cans, juice box drinks - all changed the landscape of lunch time.Schools started serving breakfast, lunch and afternoon snacks.Since my parents operated a store in town for a few years, we usually saw the families that would come in and \"buy on credit,\" which usually wasn't much. Flour, corn meal, bacon and maybe sugar when the crops were good. I was taught to help. I saw my mother for years on Sundays feed many hungry neighbors who maybe hadn't eaten for a few days. She'd pick tomatoes or corn from her garden and leave them on doorsteps. If we had it, our less fortunate neighbors also had it and vice versa. I miss those days.Now we are exploring school lunches from 2000 to 2023. Most schools are now offering two or three different lunch choices and that ever so popular a la carte menu.As I close this column today, I realize going back in time brings back so many memories of my school years! From the bus drivers - mostly men who lived locally, had local jobs, were farmers, members of our local fire department and who attended our small church. So, hiding mischief was a \"no go\" as one glance of their eyes meant \"momma and poppa\" run the local store and I will be stopping by there after the morning run! Our cafeteria \"ladies\" were mostly locals from our small town, and they cooked like \"mom.\" Our two teachers and one principal-teacher were from Ocean City and owned a hotel where several students' families worked. A community park is now in the spot where Bishopville Elementary School once stood. As I look at where the school once stood, I am flooded with memories.No matter what type of lunch bag or box you carried, no matter what kind of biscuit or bread you used, and no matter what kind of filling was on that sandwich, we were all the same children from a small town!Those sandwiches were all the same - peanut butter with jelly or jam or honey. Eskay bologna and cheese or Spam and mustard. Leftover meatloaf or a piece of leftover fried chicken. Tuna fish or a piece of bread wrapped around a cold piece of leftover fried tongue - that was for you Nellie!Have a wonderful 2023-2024 school year y'all! \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Students Paying Less for College Than 15 Years Ago",
    "date": "2023-08-30",
    "author": "George F. Will",
    "content": "Students paying less for college than 15 years ago\n\n August 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George F. Will | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 757\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - From sea to shining sea, the shining faces of young people are turning expectantly toward another year in the groves of academe. Heading for college, they leave behind parents who might understandably be bewildered about the price of higher education.(Higher than what?It's complicated, and a question for another day.)There is ample evidence that colleges mangle the truth about so many subjects (e.g., history, contemporary life, how literature should be studied, freedom of expression on campuses, etc.) that it should not surprise anyone that the counterintuitive reality about tuition is deliberately obscured - and cunningly complicated.Fortunately, Dan Currell has entertainingly dispelled the manufactured mists that engulf \"The Truth about College Costs,\" which is the title of his astringent essay in the summer issue of National Affairs. Formerly a senior adviser at the Education Department, Currell has glad tidings: \"Students are paying less for college than they did 15 years ago.\" This is, as Currell knows, \"deeply contrary to conventional wisdom,\" but the reason for it is hiding in plain sight: \"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, colleges discovered that the appearance of high tuition was good for marketing.\" Since then, they have toiled to keep \"nearly invisible\" the fact that 96 percent of students pay about $15,000 a year for tuition.Add $10,000 for room and board, and the $25,000 total is a far cry from the eye-watering numbers that colleges are actually pleased to have bandied about.A few highly selective colleges educate a \"small and highly unrepresentative\" fraction of students. \"The top 100 private schools enroll around 500,000 students,\" while the other 2,600 four-year schools enroll about 10.5 million.Most of the elite schools could fill their annual enrollments several times over with the children of the affluent who would gladly pay the advertised tuition - even much more. Most of these elite institutions have, however, large endowments that enable generous tuition assistance for the less affluent. For the other 2,500 institutions, a sleight of hand is the basic business practice.The Economist largely validates Currell's thesis. It reports that the average tuition paid by students at their home-state public colleges is about $10,000, and that private colleges discount tuition by more than 50 percent on average. \"The College Board, a non-profit, shows that whereas published tuition and fees for private nonprofit colleges increased from $29,000 in 2006-07 to $38,000 in 2021-22 (in 2021 dollars), the net price actually decreased from $17,000 to $15,000. The story is similar for public colleges. Published tuition and fees were nearly $8,000 in 2006-07 and rose to nearly $11,000 in 2021-22, but the net cost fell by $730.\" But, the Economist says, schools have \"an incentive to seem extortionate:\" \"Consumers tend to associate higher prices with higher quality.\" (Currell: \"Bowdoin's published tuition today is $4,000 higher than Harvard's.\") The Economist adds, \"students (and their boastful parents) are flattered by tuition markdowns pitched as merit scholarships rather than discounts.\" The discounts often are, Currell says, \"institutional scholarships\" with no money behind them. \"By 1999,\" he says, \"the fundamental dishonesty of college pricing had become clear\": \"That year, American private colleges purported to award scholarships worth more than all the tuition they collected - which is to say, their average discount had exceeded 50%.\" That explains this faux mystery: Colleges ostensibly cost $50,000 a year, \"but,\" Currell says drolly, \"they are somehow also running out of money.\" The not at all mysterious reality is, Currell says, that \"the apparent rise in tuition after the mid-1990s\" is \"almost entirely illusory.\" \"In fact,\" Currell says, \"if a typical college collected its sticker price in full, its leaders would hardly know what to do with all the money.\" For example, Beloit College, a Wisconsin liberal arts school with a $43 million budget, would have an extra $26 million.Colleges can minimize their discounts by instead steering parents toward having government provide the discount with subsidized student loans.Among the social costs of what Currell calls the \"fundamental dishonesty\" about college pricing is today's mountain of college debt: \"Many families simply believe there is a $200,000 tollbooth on the road to the American dream, so they sign the loan forms.\" Academia has appointed itself the nation's moral tutor whose duty is to make Americans remorseful about almost everything, including deceptive practices that the tutor insists characterize unsavory capitalism. So, it is fun to have Currell's demonstration that our supposed moral betters have practices that are, to use one of their favorite words, problematic.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nNew graduates line up before the start of a community college commencement in 2018 \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

People everywhere, smile, some tears, but I think it's a new beginning,\" Pepukayi said. \"It's another year to start again, or to continue the good things that we're doing. Just a full day of energy.\" \"It's very exciting, especially as a parent,\" Dodson said, having dropped her three kids off before greeting other students to their place of learning. \"I'm also very excited as a school board member to see Dr. Pepukayi's vision, because she's doing a great job.We're very happy with her as our superintendent, and she's got a lot of good plans for our school system.\" First grader Jackson Follett arrived for his first day ever at Easton Elementary School with a excitement and a dash of healthy and understandable nerves.Jackson's mom, Danielle, was not only dropping him off, but was similarly coming to her first day at Easton Elementary, where she will working as an instructional assistant. The Folletts recently moved to Easton, where Danielle grew up, and she said she is continuing her education at Chesapeake College.After the kids all arrived, the staff members filtered back inside, ready to continue the next part of the day's schedule in their mission of educating and preparing the students. \n \n Caption: MIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nA staff member and students walk into the first day of school at Easton Elementary on Monday, Aug. 28, with \"Welcome Back Tigers\" in the background.\n \nMIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTalbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi and Board of Education member Amy Dodson welcome students on the first day of school at Easton Elementary on Monday, Aug. 28.\n \nMIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nA crossing guard greets pint-sized pedestrians on the first day of school at Easton Elementary on Monday, Aug. 28. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Holt Scholarship Fund at Mid-Shore Community Foundation celebrated its 10th anniversary this year by awarding $560,000 in scholarships to deserving Caroline County students.Over the last 10 years, the fund has awarded $2.8 million.The story behind the fund is about a successful woman from Caroline County who wanted her assets to be used toward bettering her fellow man - specifically supporting the educational endeavors of students in need of financial support to achieve their goals.Roberta \"Bobbie\" Baxter Holt was a native of Federalsburg. She graduated from Federalsburg High School and then received her bachelor's degree in sociology at the University of Delaware, a master's degree in social work at the University of Minnesota, and a doctorate in social work from the Catholic University of America.She was a research associate in the laboratory of Brain Evolution and Behavior at the National Institutes of Mental Health and had a long successful career as a psychotherapist with a family-oriented practice in Chevy Chase, Maryland.She also served on the faculty of Georgetown University in what is now the Bowen Center for the Study of the Family. She lived in Chevy Chase, Maryland, and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.\"She remained connected to her Federalsburg roots. She exemplified her personal philosophy of doing something productive every day to further yourself or humankind.She was determined to use her success and the assets of her estate to encourage others to do the same. Her brother, Haines Holt, established this extraordinary scholarship program to fulfill her commitment to education,\" said Buck Duncan, president of MSCF.Education was something Bobbie valued.Haines said, \"As the executor of her estate, I knew she wanted the funds to help people in Caroline County further their education.\" Although Bobbie never had children of her own, she influenced many children, including the life of one of her closest friends who shared her memories of Bobbie, stating, \"She came from a small provincial town, went far, and yet remained humble She was a supportive friend to young people. My daughter asked, 'Did she have a glimmer of the impact she had on peopleft'\" Bobbie was exposed to the needs of the Caroline County community while working as a volunteer toward the end of her life with the Caroline County Department of Social Services.Mid-Shore Community Foundation awards scholarships to high school seniors in Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's, and Talbot Counties. In FY23, MSCF awarded 221 scholarships, totaling $1.7 Million.The majority of the Foundation's scholarships, including the Roberta B. Holt Scholarship, are awarded through a Pooled Scholarship Application - students complete one online application and the Foundation matches them to all scholarships for which they meet eligibility. The 2023/24 Pooled Scholarship Application will open on December 1, 2023.

    "content": "University of Maryland Eastern Shore increases enrollment once again\n\n September 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A12 | Section: News \n \n 712\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n PRINCESS ANNE - The University of Maryland Eastern Shore will have a third consecutive year of increased new student enrollment and is on pace to surpass the largest influx of freshmen and transfer students in eight years.In the fall of 2022, 733 new undergraduate students were enrolled at UMES, which was shy of the 1,011 students who came to Princess Anne at the start of the 2015 school year.\"Currently, we have 825 new students enrolled, and we continue to push the needle to welcome in as many students as we're capable of serving,\" said Latoya Jenkins, UMES's vice president of enrollment management and student experience.\"I think that ultimately we'll surpass the largest class we had in 2015, but we still have work to do to ultimately see where we will end up,\" she said.The increased enrollment numbers at UMES are following a national trend which has seen continual new student growth at Historically Black Colleges and Universities since 2020.The drive to increase enrollment has been one of the initiatives driven by President Heidi M. Anderson since the return to campus following the pandemic. Jenkins said President Anderson challenged them to not only to continue to increase enrollment, but also enhance retention efforts, which has seen a 10 percent uptick.As part of the mission to raise student enrollment, the admissions and recruitment department has worked on strategies to not only raise awareness of the UMES brand to students and parents, but strengthen connections with stakeholders according to Darryl Isom, director of admissions and recruitment.\"I've been here about two years, and when I initially came on board, the determination was that the UMES brand really needed to be defined,\" Isom said. \"We needed to get a unified message into the community, into our feeder schools, and into the nation of what we really are about, our unique programs, our family atmosphere, and how we have all the resources of a research institution but the feel of a very small liberal arts school and that has really resonated.\" Isom also attributes the gains to the outstanding work of his admissions and recruitment staff, which continues to expand.\"We're seeing the benefits of that where our name, our brand, our name recognition is really growing locally as we had to re-penetrate and reinforce our mission locally with our local market, nationally, and even internationally to a certain extent,\" he said. \"My team has gotten out there and really told the story of UMES and what a really wonderful institution this is. So that has been very instrumental in the pivot that we did initially in terms of our recruiting strategy.\" That recruiting strategy includes the use of a regional ad campaign through Baltimore-based tbc Inc., targeting the New York City, Philadelphia, Norfolk and Atlanta, Salisbury and the Baltimore/Washington D.C. markets. In addition to the campaign, UMES partnered with consulting firms such as Ruffalo Noel Levitz geared to helping UMES create best practices for enrollment management.Recruiting isn't the only focus. There is also an emphasis on registering transfer students, which include junior and community college graduates. So far, an estimated 200 transfer students are expected to make their way to Princess Anne.Jenkins said as a result of partnerships with institutions including Wor-Wic Community College, UMES has been able to share its stories and information about the rate of success students with two-year degrees have at the university.\"When students transfer from Wor-Wic to UMES, they do better and graduate in less time to complete their four-year degree,\" she said. \"That's not something UMES or Wor-Wic made up, that's baked in our data from the national clearinghouse.\" As the student population and campus community continues to grow and new academic courses are unveiled such as the new online and continuing education programs, Jenkins said one of the long-term goals is to return enrollment numbers back to pre-pandemic levels, something which is not out of the realm of possibility, but will involve continual progress.\"We have talked about charting the heights of our enrollment that was, in 2017, upwards of the times which we had around 4,000 students,\" she said. \"I think that coming out of a pandemic and where our institution is, we are poised to grow, but it will take us some time to get back to those numbers.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gambrill rushed to Woolford's office to report the attack, but the assistant principal sent Gambrill home without ensuring that she received medical treatment. Gambrill sustained a concussion from that incident, the plaintiffs asserted.The Gambrill family reported the attack to Collins, but said that Collins told them that substitute teachers are not trained well, cannot control the classroom and that \"boys will be boys,\" according to a statement of facts filed by the plaintiffs.A second violent incident occurred in a science class on Dec. 14, 2016, while students were under the supervision of another substitute teacher.Plaintiffs said Gambrill was attacked by another male student, who grabbed her neck and flipped her backward, causing her to strike her head. Gambrill suffered another concussion from the attack.The plaintiffs said the second substitute teacher witnessed the attack and allowed it to happen \"without any intervention.\" The same student who assaulted Gambrill on Dec. 14 struck her in the face on Dec. 19, 2016, while both were at the nurse's office, plaintiffs said.Gambrill attempted to defend herself by pushing the student away, but was never given an opportunity to tell her side of the story.Plaintiffs said that Woolford failed to investigate the incident and \"immediately\" handed Gambrill a two-day out-of-school suspension as punishment.Attorneys for the family said that the defendants \"exacted unjustified discipline\" on Gambrill that year through suspensions, denying her attendance on school trips and requiring her to sit alone at lunch. Woolford reportedly harassed Gambrill by sending her home to change clothes, according to the court filing.Plaintiffs assert that the defendants failed to properly address the family's concerns for Gambrill's safety and failed to properly supervise and train substitute teachers.In June 2019, a judge in Dorchester County Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts that remained, including the negligence claim.The Gambrill family appealed the circuit court's ruling on the negligence claim in July 2019. About two years later, the Appellate Court of Maryland affirmed the lower court's ruling.The Gambrill family filed a second appeal to the Supreme Court of Maryland shortly after. But last August, the state's highest court reversed both lower rulings and remanded the case back to Dorchester County for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.The trial is expected to conclude Friday, according to court records. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY CHRISTINA AU FDERHEIDE \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Board members asked questions about how the schools plan to track progress, address staffing vacancies and what things the board and community can do to help the schools reach their goals.Throughout the rest of the meeting, board members asked questions, initiated conversations and probed deeper about many of the meeting's agenda items.At the end of the meeting, board member Theresa Stafford gave her hopes for the school year.\"I hope that as we move forward as a board, the community does not have to guess where we are and where we're going,\" she said.\"This year we will be transparent in everything we do.\" Stafford said conversations are healthy and that hard conversations need to happen.\"One of the first things in moving forward,\" she said, \"(is) we have to be realistic.And we may not paint a rosy picture that everybody this year is going to sit here and smile and agree.\" Stafford said that, as board members, listening to the community and supporting teachers is vital.\"We are the voice of the people who elected us to make sure that we are doing the best we can for the kids we have and for the community that we serve,\" she said.Board member Chris Wheedleton said he's excited about making data-driven decisions this school year. He said there a plans for a new dashboard that will show whether progress on student outcomes is being made in the district.\"We're putting ourselves to account and making sure that we can really report where we're seeing progress,\" he said.Wheedleton also talked about the importance of having civil and constructive conversations as a board. He said that this can go handin-hand with data-driven decision making.\"I think that's an important message for our kids to hear as we go back into school as well - that civility and data can actually go together,\" he said. \"It's all about us looking at the data and then making really smart decisions about what we do.\" School Board President Susan Morgan said it's going to take collaboration to effect change.\"There's no reason that Dorchester County can't be the best county on the Eastern Shore for education,\" she said. \"To do that though, we need a little bit more help.We need help from parents, guardians, grandparents, anyone who has a child in our system.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nDorchester County Board of Education Member Theresa Stafford speaks during a Board of Education meeting Aug. 17 in Cambridge.\n \nMAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nDorchester County Board of Education Member Chris Wheedleton speaks during a Board of Education meeting Aug. 17 in Cambridge. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "author": "Local News Network University Of Maryland's Philip Merrill College Of Journalism",
    "content": "'Contracted Out' - An unprecedented look at Maryland public school spending\n\n September 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Local News Network University Of Maryland's Philip Merrill College Of Journalism | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1156\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Billions of local, state and federal tax dollars go to funding Maryland's public schools every year - and now, it will be easier for you to find out how your local school district spent that money.That's because the Local News Network at the University of Maryland has published an easily searchable database where you can look up your school district's vendor payments over the past four years.That database and an accompanying series of stories comprise \"Contracted Out,\" a project compiled over the past seven months by students and faculty at the UMD Philip Merrill College of Journalism. The \"Contracted Out\" database provides a comprehensive and unprecedented itemization of school contract spending statewide.\"If there is any corruption out there, it's through these contracts,\" said Marguerite Roza, director of Georgetown University's Edunomics Lab, a research institute that studies education funding data.\"Contracted Out\" gives local journalists and the general public something they've never had before: an easy way to review school district vendor payments.The \"Contracted Out\" database contains information from all 24 public school districts in Maryland, with the ability to break out individual districts. The database includes every vendor that was paid over $25,000 by each district between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years.The Local News Network turned more than 26,000 rows of raw data into news the public can use. School district payments for health insurance, buses, computers and meals - it's all there.Still, there are limits to the data.Vendor payments account for only a small portion of school funding in Maryland or any other state. Roza said the vast majority of school spending - 80% to 90% of it - goes to teacher and staff salaries, not vendors.The data used to construct the \"Contracted Out\" database - most of it obtained through the state's Open Data Portal - lacks detail. Most districts only have to report payments of more than $25,000, the name of the vendor and the ZIP code where the vendor is based. A quirk in state law requires only Baltimore County Public Schools to say why they spent what they spent.School districts have differing policies regarding which services they contract out and which they handle in-house. For example, some districts have their own bus fleets while others hire contractors to transport students.Districts also disagree on what constitutes a vendor payment. Most notably, some list state and federal taxes as vendor payments, but others exclude them from the data. For that reason, any district-by-district comparison of overall vendor payments would not be statistically valid.Even so, the data that's online serves a useful purpose, said Matthew Streett, assistant director in the state's Office of Legislative Audits.\"I look at it from a transparency and accountability standpoint,\" Streett said. \"The public wants to know where their taxpayer dollars are going when it comes to educating students.\" Streett's office routinely audits school district spending, as do district officials and inspector general offices in individual counties.Meanwhile, the Office of the State Inspector General for Education performs audits based on tips about possible wrongdoing.You can find details about some of the recent audits here.Those audits can spot big trouble. For example, an internal review of contracting in Montgomery County Public Schools last year found evidence of irregularities in the district's transportation department. A criminal investigation then led to a guilty plea to a felony theft charge by the department's former assistant director, as well as a guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge by the department's former director.But the checks and balances on school spending don't depend primarily on auditors and investigators.School boards review and authorize vendor payments, said Milton E. Nagel, executive director of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education.\"Maryland procurement laws apply to school districts,\" he said. \"School districts can't go out and stroke a million-dollar check to a vendor without going through a bid process.\" But Roza said school boards rarely go over vendor contracts line by line.\"They end up going into a consent agenda, and the whole board goes, 'Everybody want to approve the 91 contracts that we have coming before the board this month? All in favor? Aye,'\" she said.In most states, those contracts are published only in a school board's minutes, not online like in Maryland, Roza said.But the Local News Network found big problems with the school contracting data on the state's Open Data Portal.When work on the project began in January, huge chunks of data from four of the five largest school districts in the state were missing.Data was missing from several smaller districts, too - even though a 2019 act of the General Assembly requires districts to report vendor payments of over $25,000 with the Department of Budget and Management.Student journalists and Local News Network Director Jerry Zremski spent months prodding districts to comply with the law and provide the missing data.The last to do so, Baltimore City and Baltimore County, didn't do that until early June.Derek Willis, lecturer in computational and data journalism at Merrill College, then completed the work his students had begun: cleaning up the data so that every vendor was listed by the same name.A team of 38 student journalists reviewed the incomplete data before the spring semester ended and Zremski studied the late-arriving data.Their key findings will be included in the accompanying stories, but local journalists around the state and citizens may also want to take a close look at the data. As Roza noted, the people closest to the local school districts - reporters and citizens who live in those districts - will be the ones most likely to spot questionable vendor payments.In doing so, Roza said, people should remember one thing about school district vendor data: scandal can be rooted in them. She cited a case from Chicago, where the former CEO of the public school district ended up spending nearly three years in federal prison because she steered tens of millions in no-bid contracts to her friends.And Richard Henry, the state's inspector general for education, encouraged the public to contact his office if they see anything in the contracting data that seems suspicious.\"I always encourage individuals to give us a call, and if they want to remain anonymous, they can remain anonymous,\" Henry said.\"We continue to encourage outreach to all members of the education profession throughout the state and throughout the county governments to report any type of waste, fraud and abuse.\" Local News Network Director Jerry Zremski compiled this story based in part on the work of 38 Philip Merrill College of Journalism students who were enrolled in a mid-level reporting class in the spring semester.Kara Thompson of the Capital News Service Annapolis Bureau and Joel Lev-Tov, an independent study student with the Local News Network, contributed to this report. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nThe Talbot County Public Schools Education Foundation aims to close the \"digital divide\" that impacts hundreds of Talbot County students.\n \nAPG STAFF\n \nThis graph reflects the amount spent by the five Mid-Shore county school districts by vendor. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Henry, Maryland's inspector general for education, acknowledged the possibility that officials in other school districts could be misusing the school contracting system.\"You know, we don't find out all the time, but there will always be some individuals who will take advantage of flaws in the system, and you know, possibly profit from it or use it to their advantage,\" Henry said.County or district officials frequently audit local school districts in Maryland.On top of that, the state Office of Legislative Audits reviews the books of each school district once every six years, whereas the Maryland Office of the Inspector General for Education takes complaints from the public and investigates them.But audits, while helpful, can only identify problems. It is up to the districts to implement solutions - and often they don't. The Office of Legislative Audits released an audit of the Maryland State Department of Education in January. Auditors found 171 repeated findings that local school systems had yet to address from previous audits.Matthew Streett, assistant director of the Compliance and Performance Audit Division in the Office of Legislative Audits, said school districts should take audit findings seriously.\"I think it's important to safeguard the assets because ultimately, when you're talking about money that flows through the school system, it's all intended to help educate the students, and if money is being diverted, it's less money that's intended for the classroom and students,\" Streett said.Public school districts in Montgomery County, Baltimore City, Howard County, Charles County and Calvert County have all been audited in recent years. Concerns raised in those audits range from unauthorized transactions to insufficient documentation to justify major purchases.In addition, the audits found that nearly every school district failed to complete proper documentation for approval of intergovernmental purchasing agreements. In many cases, employees made purchases without documenting why they were necessary and beneficial to the district.Here's a detailed look at what auditors and investigators found in recent years in those individual school districts: MONTGOMERY COUNTYAuditors have found a number of issues with school district contracting in Montgomery County, but none more serious than the one that led to guilty pleas from two district transportation department officials this year.In May, Charles Ewald, the district's former assistant transportation director, pleaded guilty to one count of felony theft and one misdemeanor count of misconduct in office.Court records said Ewald used his position to request checks from an \"off-the-books\" account held by one of the district's longtime bus vendors, American Truck & Bus Inc. The money came from late fee and change fee reimbursements owed to the district - and, according to court documents, $352,568.68 of it went directly to Ewald's bank account. In addition, Ewald had the bus vendor issue about $16,000 in checks to other school district staff members.Todd Watkins, the former director of the transportation department, pleaded guilty in June to one count of misconduct in office, and not just because he failed to fulfill his role of overseeing the department's expenses. Watkins was the one who coordinated with American Truck & Bus to establish the \"offthe-books\" account, court records said.Watkins received more than $13,000 using the account and intentionally violated the district's reimbursement policy, but he provided documentation for those payments and was not charged with theft.A judge will sentence Ewald and Watkins in September, closing a criminal case that began with an internal review in 2021.Then last December, the Montgomery County Office of the Inspector General found that school district transportation department officials used school funds to pay for a NASCAR headset, drag racing tires, a sport loop band for an Apple Watch, a car roof rack for kayaks, Home Depot and Amazon gift cards, along with other personal items. The purchases totaled nearly $5,000.In response to the audit, Montgomery County Public Schools officials confirmed all the findings were factually accurate and outlined procedures they planned to implement to correct the problems.CALVERT COUNTYThe state Office of Legislative Audits reported in January 2022 that Calvert County Public Schools took shortcuts in the spending approval process and failed to monitor whether their vendors were billing them correctly.The lack of oversight on the district's financial systems allowed individual departments and schools to make purchases while skipping necessary procurement processes, auditors said.Auditors raised questions about the district's transportation costs. Compared to other comparable-sized districts, Calvert County schools paid 22 cents per mile more for transportation.In addition, the district paid over a half-million dollars in bus operations fees without providing any reasonable justification for these transportation costs.On other contracts, the district didn't check to see if the price written on the invoice from vendors matched the pricing agreed to in the contract. The audit found five payments in intergovernmental contract agreements that added up to $642,000 that were vaguely detailed or had different product descriptions.Calvert County Public Schools accepted the audit results and said it would address the issues. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nBuses prepare for departure from Easton Elementary after the first day of school in 2022. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That's because money is about values, relationships, choices and self-worth.And while teaching your kids important values to guide their lives is of the utmost importance, when all is said and done those values are more likely to be caught than taught.You have to live what you teach.If there is one thing that will ruin your kids' lives, it's greed. Teach them while they're young how to pull the drain plug on greed, and you will have prepared them in a very important way to not only survive, but to also thrive in the real world.The antidote for greed is giving away part of the three T's - your time, your talent and your treasure. Everyone, no matter how young or poor, possesses all three.Time: You get 24 hours every day, 10,080 minutes or 604,800 seconds every week.Talent: This is what you can do. Everyone has special talents, things they are good at doing.Treasure: This is what you have, your possessions. It's your money, and also your toys, clothes, collections - everything that you own.Are you bewildered? If you have never been a \"giver\" it may seem quite odd for me to suggest you should just give away any of your time or your stuff. But that is exactly what I mean.If you want to make sure you are never defeated by greed, learn to be a giver.When you give to others it helps you to be grateful for what you have. Giving is the way to stop feeling sorry for yourself. Instead of misery, you feel joy. In place of dissatisfaction you find contentment.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Representative from both organizations and the Town of Goldsboro set up by the old railroad station. In less than 2 hours, 110 backpacks filled with supplies like notebooks, rulers, pens and pencils, and other items necessary for successful academic learning, were distributed to children and families.This year the Town of Goldsboro got involved by donating money toward the supplies and providing crafts and activities for kids to do to get them in the back-to-school mindset.\"We wanted to get involved this year because we could see the real need in our community and are always looking for more ways to reach out to our residents and help them with resources,\" said Jeannette DeLude, town manager of Goldsboro.\"The town is so happy that CASA of Caroline and Caroline Pride have brought this event to our town. The North County area is often overlooked, and we, the town and its council, are thrilled that we can help families in need in this part of Caroline County and encourage everyone to also come out for our Fall Fest on Oct. 7 in the same location,\" she said.This is the third year these two agencies have brought school supplies to the northern part of the county.Amy Horne, executive director at CASA of Caroline, said, \"We know that the kids our program serves are involved with multiple systems - the court system, the child welfare system, the health care system, and the school system. As a result, returning to school can be difficult and unpredictable.Our goal is not only to advocate for kids in the courtroom but also in the classroom. By ensuring the children in our community have all the supplies they need to learn and perform in the classroom, we are setting them up for success.\" Having a backpack and school supplies on the first day of school is important for young scholars to feel like they fit in with their peers. Students who feel they fit in at school are more likely to participate in school activities, have friends, perform better academically and have good mental health.\"As a member of a vulnerable population that is targeted by bullies, I know what it's like to feel left out.I don't want any kid in Caroline County to start their school year feeling left out because they didn't have a backpack or any supplies on their first day of school,\" said Angel Perez, CEO of Caroline Pride.Ashley Powell from Greensboro Elementary helped pack the backpacks.Numerous businesses and individuals donated items and money to make the program a success.\"I'm so proud to be a part of this community that gives back to those in need,\" Perez said.\"Yes, it's a community effort, and we're all responsible for keeping our eyes on kids and making sure they have what they need to feel safe, set up for success, and to thrive,\" Horne said. \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nCASA of Caroline and Caroline Pride gave away more than a hundred backpack for a back to school effort in the northern part of Caroline County. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Counties ponder money for college building - Financial commitment worries many of the county officials\n\n September 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: A13 | Section: News \n \n 676\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Talbot and Queen Anne's counties came together virtually Monday to discuss a $79 million project to build a new Technical Center at Chesapeake College.Each county must decide whether or not it wants to submit a letter of intent to the Maryland Higher Education Commission to provide local funds for the facility before a Sept. 28 meeting at the Department of Budget and Management. The meeting, according to Chesapeake College President Cliff Coppersmith, is an opportunity to get the project \"to the next level\" by getting it put on a state list of capital projects.The state has agreed to pay for 75% of the capital project.With these letters of intent, each county would agree to providing local funds for the other 25%. In an email, Coppersmith said that once state funding has been allocated and approved, each supporting county would need to pass appropriations to fund the local share of the capital project.The facility would be more than 90,000 square feet. Of that total, 52,000 square feet would be assignable space. Currently, construction is set for 2026. The center will be located next to the Eastern Shore Higher Education Center.\"Our problem right now is we've got so much equipment crammed in these spaces, there's not a lot of room for students,\" Coppersmith said of the current Queen Anne's Technical Building during the meeting.According to meeting documents from a Queen Anne's County Commissioners meeting Sept. 12, the new facility \"will house programs such as electrical, welding, HVAC, culinary, skilled office/administrative support and marine and construction trades training.\" Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian chaired the meeting between counties Monday evening. Fithian said that while the new facility would be great to have on the Eastern Shore, Kent County does have concerns about the financial aspect of the project.Caroline County Commission Vice President Larry Porter said the cost of building the new facility is what strikes him most.\"I would really like to have a little bit more information about where that number is coming from,\" he said.Coppersmith said the estimated cost includes furnishing the building. He added that the equipment is not a part of that estimate.\"Existing equipment that's useable and still in date, we would just move into the new facility and obviously we would raise money - private funding, public grants, etc.- to upgrade our equipment once we get the building built and we're ready to move in,\" Coppersmith said.Queen Anne's County Commissioner Jack Wilson Jr. acknowledged that the price of the project is a concern, but said he feels confident they will be able to receive more money from the state for the project.Later in the meeting, Wilson said that the Queen Anne's County Commissioners had already voted last week in favor of providing letter of intent.Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said Dorchester County would have to vote against sending a letter of intent at this time. Pfeffer acknowledged that it is a \"great project\" but said that fiscal responsibilities in the county are keeping them from being able to send a letter of intent. Pfeffer said Dorchester County commissioners would be willing to send a letter of support for the project without a binding fiscal commitment.Fithian said each county is going to have to make its decision individually.\"We're all going to have to sit down with our finance office and really see what we can do,\" he said.During the meeting there were talks of possibly submitting a letter, signed by all five counties, detailing the benefits of having this new facility in order to obtain addition funding from the state.Toward the end of the meeting, Talbot County Council member Keasha Haythe said she will be voting in favor of Talbot County submitting a letter of intent.\"As a Chesapeake College alum, I believe it's very necessary and needed,\" she said. \"And considering how the labor force is doing a dive right now, this labor force is needed. We definitely have to be forward thinking to be able to accommodate the future needs of our children and those that are in high school currently.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Commission president: 'I'm on the fence with this' - Breeding balks at Caroline's share of $94M building replacement\n\n September 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: A2 | Section: News \n \n 917\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - With Caroline County's other spending priorities on the front burner, Chesapeake College's $79 million funding request to the five Mid-Shore counties to construct a new technology center was met with hesitation by the Caroline County Commissioners at their Sept. 19 meeting.But the deadline is quickly approaching to make a decision about an over $3.8 million request the county is being asked to fund as its share for a new - and the commissioners agree is necessary - technology building.A virtual meeting was held Sept. 18 between leaders of the college and of the five counties that support the community college in Wye Mills.Earlier in the month, Chesapeake College President Clifford Coppersmith made his case to the Caroline County Commission in Denton.The \"renovation project for the Queen Anne's Technical Center is well past its due date for either a heavy renovation or absolute replacement,\" Coppersmith said on Sept. 5.He asked for \"statements of support or letters of intent from each of (the) support counties.\" Those letters are due before Sept. 28. The project has been submitted to the Maryland State Department of Budget and Management, which will consider it, along with a list of other state projects, on Sept. 28.At their Sept. 19 meeting, the Caroline County Commissioners agreed to draft a letter of intent to support the project, as long as the intention is specifically worded as non-binding.The programs housed in the 2-story, 90,000 square-foot building will include electrical, welding, HVAC, culinary and marine and construction trades training.The state will pay for 75% of the project, with the remaining 25% to be funded by the five counties, and the percentages determined by each county's population. The state's contribution would be just over $59 million.At both the Sept. 5 and Sept. 19 meetings, Commission Vice President Larry Porter supported funding the project, but expressed concern about future unknown costs associated with the 2021 Blueprint for Maryland's Future.Also at the Sept. 5 meeting, Commissioner Frank Bartz supported the project. \"I support this, but Kirwan's going to be the big challenge down the road, but I think our community needs this. I think our young adults need this to offer them more opportunity.\" Kirwan is a nickname for the Blueprint.\"I really do, very seriously, understand the financial impact that this project will have on the region we serve,\" Coppersmith said on Sept. 5.As of Sept. 18, Talbot and Queen Anne's counties agreed to help finance the project. However, Dorchester County declined, and Kent and Caroline had not announced their decisions. A simple majority of counties is needed to approve funding the project.Caroline could join the Queen Anne's County's bond, but the county's interest on the bond over 20 years would increase the final cost to over $6 million.\"And that is on top of the HPAC (Health Professions and Athletics Center) building that we currently pay approximately $110,000 on, so that will put our payment for facilities at $420,000, roughly, until 2034 when the HPAC drops off,\" said Caroline County Finance Director Daniel Fox.Commission President Travis Breeding was not fully convinced at yesterday's meeting. \"This just kind of popped up two weeks ago,\" he said.\"I agree with the consensus of everyone on the call that the building is needed,\" Breeding said. \"But I'm not sure yet how it falls into my priority list. One of my major concerns is and I want to get a few more answers from the college before I vote on it.\" Breeding said he wanted to know \"is how much our local Career and Technology Education Program will be able to utilize the facility during the day.\" \"I am concerned that we have Federalsburg Elementary School, and part of that school was constructed in the 1930s,\" he said. \"We have Lockerman Middle School, Denton Elementary School (and) Ridgely Elementary, all constructed in the 70s as well, and we have a CCTC building at North Caroline High that was constructed in the 1960s. Not to mention, we have a detention center build looming on the horizon, whether we see this regional agreement through.\" \"So, I'm concerned with our ability to take on this much debt,\" Breeding said. \"I don't want to hamstring future boards with a $312,000 payment for the next 20 years, because that will be a line item that they will have no control over, and they will be forced to fund. And I'm concerned about Blueprint. I'm on the fence with this, and I'm going to do a lot more research into next week.\" Porter said he didn't support the HPAC building project, but he supports the new technology center build. \"I think while this opportunity is available, we should utilize it,\" he said. \"If these students are successful in receiving this training and these certifications, they would be able to stay in this county and not have to go somewhere else.\" Porter said he believed, based on Fox's figures, the county \"would be in a position where we would not have to borrow the entire amount.\" \"I'm also cautiously optimistic about the ability of Del. Ghrist to get some Blueprint credit for this,\" Porter said. \"I'm not counting on it, not because I don't think he can't do it - I just don't count on things that are not concrete.\" The commission will make a final decision at its 9 a.m. meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 26, in Room 106, 109 Market St., Denton. \n \n Caption: SCREENSHOT\n \nThe Caroline County Commissioners hosted a presentation by Chesapeake College President Clifford Coppersmith Sept. 5.

    "content": "Tyranny Of The Loud At Washington College\n\n September 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: David Reel | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 709\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With great shock and even greater sadness, I read media accounts of protestors disrupting a recent presentation at Washington College in Chestertown.The presentation featured Dr.Robert George, the McCormick professor of jurisprudence and director of the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions at Princeton University.While Professor George has deeply held conservative beliefs which he does not shy away from expressing, he is also a frequent conversation partner with Cornel West, a progressive professor and political activist. They have appeared together at colleges and universities around the country, arguing for civil dialogue and a broad conception of campus freedom of speech as essential to the truth-seeking mission of academic institutions.Of his longtime friend West has said: \"Robby and I struggle over many issues, but at the deepest human level, it's hard to find anyone with his kind of integrity and genuine concern for others.\"Progressive Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan has said this about Professor George: \"He is one of the nation's most respected legal theorists and the respect he has gained is due to his sheer brilliance, the analytic power of his arguments, the range of his knowledge, a deeply principled conviction and a profound and enduring integrity.\"No stranger to threats of bodily harm, Professor George was once targeted with death threats for views onabortion.So how was Professor George treated during his presentation at Washington College? Extremely poorly is an understatement.The protesters at his presentation did not quietly carry signs and engage in civil dialogue with Professor George following his remarks. Instead, media at the event reported the following: \"The protesters marched in, with campus security allowing them passage.Shouting from the protesters started right away, breaking up the professor's talk.\"The media reported the protesters waved flags, waved signs, blew whistles, played music and danced. They did not stand down until Professor George's presentation ended prematurely, and he [George] was escorted from the room.After this shameful treatment Professor George observed that in all his years visiting numerous colleges and universities including Berkeley, Yale and Harvard (hardly bastions of conservatism), he never had this happen before.After this event, he observed that \"when intimidation works, they'll continue to do it.\"Indeed, they will. Intimidation at this event did work, and there is no reason to believe the protestors will not do it again with anyone who does not embrace their views or asks them to consider other views.That being the case the following questions need to be addressed by the leadership of Washington College.What has been or will be the college's response to the protestors willful disregard for the following Washington College core values?\"We share these values of our founding patron, George Washington: integrity, determination, curiosity, civility, leadership, and moral courage. We develop in our students' habits of analytic thought and clear communication, aesthetic insight, ethical sensitivity and civic responsibility.What has been or will be the college's response to the following comment by one protestor at the event after an email was sent to all students reminding them that it would be a violation of the Student Honor Code to disrupt a speaker?\"Are you going to tell me that WAC (Washington College) can expel every single one of us?Absolutely (expletive) not!\" Why did campus security decide not to intervene with timely and appropriate steps to deal with the protesters well before their disruptive behavior resulted in a premature end of the event?Post event a college spokesperson said, \"The protesters took issue with homophobic and transphobic statements that Professor George has made in the past.\"Is the spokesperson implying that Washington College agrees with the protester's interpretations of and opinions on statements made by Professor George in the past? How committed is Washington College to free speech, civil discourse and ensuring students are exposed to a wide range of views that may challenge how they think and what they think?One can hope that going forward Washington College will walk their talk on their core principles and student honor code to help ensure this recent tyranny of the loud will never happen again. \n \n Caption: WILL BONTRA GER\n \nRobert P.

    "content": "'Fantastic job this summer' - Summer school program to expand next year\n\n September 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 15 | Section: News \n \n 919\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - Based on the success of the 2023 summer education program and continued grant funding, Caroline County Public Schools' leaders are aiming to teach 400 more students next year.Presenting statistics and anecdotal comments about the program at the Sept. 5 meeting of the Board of Education, Lindsey McCormick, director of College and Career Readiness, gave \"huge shout-outs and kudos\" to the 75 certified teachers, 15 instructional assistants and seven site coordinators who \"chose to give up portions of their summer and continue to work with our students.\" Instructional assistants also received additional training this year.Caroline County School Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons praised McCormick's leadership.\"Lindsey has done a fantastic job.Her team has done a fantastic job this summer, he said. \"This (report) is an absolute testament to that.\"McCormick said 100 Caroline County Recreation and Parks staff helped with the 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. elementary summer camp called Jurassic Jamboree, which attracted 50 more students this year than in 2022.\"They're a tremendous partner,\" she said.The summer lessons and activities were designed for elementary, middle and high school students, with special programs for students with disabilities and multilingual learners.McCormick said the five-week time frame for summer programming was essentially the same as last year's, running from June 23 to July 27. Altogether, 916 students participated.Elementary students numbered 747 and attended sessions at four elementary schools (Federalsburg was closed for renovations). The average attendance was 14 days of the 19-day program.Participating in the elementary programming were 70 multilingual learners, 49 of whom attend Greensboro Elementary School.In the morning, students participated in both Reading Eggs and Moving with Math or Agile Mind; the Agile Mind math program was introduced for fifth grade students. When the teachers left, students had lunch, and in the afternoon, Recreation and Parks staff led enrichment activities.Secondary students attended only morning sessions. McCormick said one of the goals was to \"boost our middle school program.\"\"We raised our numbers to 40 students, and I was thrilled with that,\" she said. She praised after-school coordinator Deja Thompson for implementing what McCormick envisioned.\"Our middle school students had 45 minutes a day where they could rotate through, by choice, some CTE (Career and Technology Education) mini-sessions,\" McCormick said, adding that \"one of the large pushes\" in the Blueprint For Maryland's Future is more career exploration starting in middle school through high school.McCormick added comments from both teachers and parents to her PowerPoint presentation. One parent noted, \"My seventh grade son didn't want to 'give up' his summer but over the course of five weeks, he only missed three days. He was extremely excited about the CCTC programs he was able to see.\"\"I thought it was just great that our students had the opportunity to be exposed to some of our different CTE programs,\" she said. \"The CTE teachers themselves came to the middle schools to do that.\"Middle school students attended a tri-county, career enrichment day in Dorchester County that McCormick called \"amazing.\"Simmons explained the that Dorchester program is funded by the Mid-Shore Regional Council and is led by People for Change, \"an organization out of Prince George's County of largely minority business owners and professionals who run STEM sessions.\"High school students were offered summer \"credit recovery\" courses, and 131 participated and passed the courses, 92 from North Caroline and 39 from Colonel Richardson.\"It was less students this year, which you could say is a good thing because if you are doing credit recovery, you want less students,\" McCormick said. Students can take credit recovery courses during the school year, as well as repeat courses to earn credits needed for graduation.The program for students with disabilities from elementary through high school increased by 30, with 127 students participating, 102 at the elementary level, and 25 secondary students.CCPS Food Service provided breakfast and lunch for all students, as well as lunch for elementary students, or nearly 15,000 meals. Health rooms were staffed with nurses and health assistants, and School Based Wellness Centers were open.McCormick expects next year's program to be the same duration.\"Nineteen days is amazing.It's not too short, and it's not too long,\" she said.Because some classrooms had waitlists, McCormick said her \"goal is to increase summer programming by 400 students, so I have to have about 1,200 to 1,300 students next summer.\"A 21st Century Grant is pending to help fund the program.This year's program was funded by the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) Fund, food services and in-kind in use of buildings, according to CCPS Communications Officer Sandi Barry.\"We have this funding for one more year, and we want to make sure we maximize it.,\" Simmons said. \"We will continue to look for grant opportunities working with our partners, with Recreation Parks, with the YMCA, if possible.\"\"We will continue working with our partners, but we're going to maximize everything we can to make it make it work, make it sustainable, and then have the great data to then go to the grant sources to keep the funding coming in,\" Simmons said. \n \n Caption: A big bounce house and slippery slide cool off Preston Elementary School students who attend the 19-day summer program.\n \nA little game of checkers is a great way to connect during summer camp at Greensboro Elementary School.\n \nLindsey McCormick, CCPS director of College and Career Readiness, presents results of the Summer School program.\n \nThese two friendly Greensboro Elementary School Hornets are not in a stinging mood during summer camp. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Raskin leads recognition of Banned Books Week\n\n September 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josie Jack; Capital News Service | Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 466\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Mary-land, and Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, introduced a bill Wednesday calling for the national recognition of Banned Books Week, which is Oct. 1-7, and the condemnation of banning books in school libraries.The bill recommends that local governments and schools \"protect the rights of students to learn and the ability of educators and librarians to teach\" and calls for upholding the First Amendment but does not include a unified national protocol for dealing with book bans.\"You know, the proper response to hating a book in a free society is you don't read the book,\" Raskin said at a Capitol Hill press conference Wednesday.The bill, which has 40 co-sponsors in the House and 15 in the Senate, echoes bills the lawmakers introduced in the last session of Congress but neither measure passed.Instances of book banning increased by 33% from the 2021-2022 school year to the 2022-2023 school year, according to the nonprofit PEN America. Books such as \"The Bluest Eye\" by Toni Morrison and \"Gender Queer: A Memoir\" by Maia Kobabe repeatedly have been targeted by critics. Many titles that receive so-called requests for review involve themes of race, sexuality and sexual abuse.Between July 1, 2022, and June 30, there were 3,362 instances of book banning in public libraries and in schools, according to PEN America.Florida accounted for 40% of the book bans. Top states where book bans were instituted were Texas, Utah, Missouri and Pennsylvania.The Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month held a hearing on book bans, where senators and five witnesses discussed balancing the freedom of speech of parents and taxpayers with those of students, teachers and librarians. The hearing examined book ban policies at the state and local level.The debate did not include the introduction of federal policies on book bans nor a tangible, federal solution. Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, asked witnesses Cameron Samuels, a student at Brandeis University and co-founder of Students Engaged in Advancing Texas, and Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias to provide a clear solution; neither did.\"The discussion we've been having for me, it's a little too conceptual, or I don't know, metaphysical,\" Kennedy said.The federal government has not passed legislation to create a unified procedure on book bans. Book ban and review policies and decisions are currently made at the local government level.On June 12, Illinois passed a law that makes libraries that ban books ineligible for state-funded grants. It is the first state in the country to take such action and could pave the way for future federal legislation.\"It's my hope that other states, that others may look toward Illinois and see the value in adopting our legislation as a model to stop banning booksin its tracks and to protect the right to read freely without fear of retribution,\" Giannou-lias said at the legislation's signing. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Counties ponder money for college building - Financial commitment worries many of the county officials\n\n October 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 16 | Section: News \n \n 675\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Talbot and Queen Anne's counties came together virtually recently to discuss a $79 million project to build a new Technical Center at Chesapeake College?Each county must decide whether or not it wants to submit a letter of intent to the Maryland Higher Education Commission to provide local funds for the facility before a Sept. 28 meeting at the Department of Budget and Management. The meeting, according to Chesapeake College President Cliff Coppersmith, is an opportunity to get the project \"to the next level\" by getting it put on a state list of capital projects.The state has agreed to pay for 75% of the capital project. With these letters of intent, each county would agree to providing local funds for the other 25%. In an email, Coppersmith said that once state funding has been allocated and approved, each supporting county would need to pass appropriations to fund the local share of the capital project.The facility would be more than 90,000 square feet. Of that total, 52,000 square feet would be assignable space. Currently, construction is set for 2026. The center will be located next to the Eastern Shore Higher Education Center.\"Our problem right now is we've got so much equipment crammed in these spaces, there's not a lot of room for students,\" Coppersmith said of the current Queen Anne's Technical Building during the meeting.According to meeting documents from a Queen Anne's County Commissioners meeting Sept. 12, the new facility \"will house programs such as electrical, welding, HVAC, culinary, skilled office/administrative support and marine and construction trades training.\"Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian chaired the meeting between counties Monday evening. Fithian said that while the new facility would be great to have on the Eastern Shore, Kent County does have concerns about the financial aspect of the project.Caroline County Commission Vice President Larry Porter said the cost of building the new facility is what strikes him most.\"I would really like to have a little bit more information about where that number is coming from,\" he said.Coppersmith said the estimated cost includes furnishing the building. He added that the equipment is not a part of that estimate.\"Existing equipment that's useable and still in date, we would just move into the new building and obviously we would raise money - private funding, public grants, etc. - to upgrade our equipment once we get the building built and we're ready to move in,\" Coppersmith said.Queen Anne's County Commissioner Jack Wilson Jr. acknowledged that the price of the project is a concern, but said he feels confident they will be able to receive more money from the state for the project.Later in the meeting, Wilson said that the Queen Anne's County Commissioners had already voted last week in favor of providing letter of intent.Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said Dorchester County would have to vote against sending a letter of intent at this time. Pfeffer acknowledged that it is a \"great project\" but said that fiscal responsibilities in the county are keeping them from being able to send a letter of intent. Pfeffer said Dorchester County commissioners would be willing to send a letter of support for the project without a binding fiscal commitment.Fithian said each county is going to have to make its decision individually.\"We're all going to have to sit down with our finance office and really see what we can do,\" he said.During the meeting there were talks of possibly submitting a letter, signed by all five counties, detailing the benefits of having this new facility in order to obtain addition funding from the state.Toward the end of the meeting, Talbot County Council member Keasha Haythe said she will be voting in favor ofTalbot County submitting a letter of intent.\"As a Chesapeake College alum, I believe it's very necessary and needed,\" she said. \"And considering how the labor force is doing a dive right now, this labor force is needed. We definitely have to be forward thinking to be able to accommodate the future needs of our children and those that are in high school currently.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Counties sue social media over mental health in schools - Talbot among 10 counties claiming classroom distraction\n\n October 5, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Christina Walker; Capital News Service | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1088\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A \"boring and pointless\" education.That's what students at Henry E. Lackey High School in Indian Head, in Charles County, tell their English teacher Nicholas Gray they're receiving while they distract themselves with TikTok videos, \"snaps\" on Snapchat and endless scrolls through Instagram during class.\"It is difficult to convince [students] that learning is more impactful and important than the brand new video that will entertain them,\" Gray said.With that thought in mind, Charles County this month joined nine other Maryland school districts in a lawsuit against the world's social media giants: Google, Meta, ByteDance and Snap Inc. Other school districts in the state that have joined the court action are Anne Arundel, Baltimore City, Carroll, Cecil, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George's and Talbot.\"Hopefully this lawsuit provides pressure for some action in terms of how to better create products that are geared to children,\" said Maria Navarro, superintendent of Charles County Public Schools.CLASSROOM DISTRACTIONThe lawsuit accused several social media platforms of targeting and manipulating youth so they stay engaged for excessive amounts of time - and that's exactly what educators see in Charles County classrooms.\"(Social media is) a huge distraction in our schools and in our classrooms,\" said Cheryl Davis, principal of Henry E. Lackey High School.The teachers do their part to plan effective, instructional uses for technology in the classroom, Davis said, but personal devices get in the way.Gray said he prohibits the use of cell phones during instructional times and tries to create engaging lessons so that students will not be tempted to use their devices or go on social media.However, he said, the biggest problem plaguing his students is self control and their failure to regulate personal behavior.\"Students are lacking the ability to express their emotions in a positive way,\" Davis said. \"We see a lot more negative expressions.\"Students have gotten more angry and aggressive, Davis said. In a developmental part of their lives, they often fail to pause for a moment and look for resources or constructive ways to express their emotions.\"There is no respite,\" Gray said. \"Students leave for the day and the talking/anger continues onto Instagram or Snapchat, and then the students come to school upset over what is on social media.\"Several Charles County educators said more physical altercations have occurred because of social media conflicts.\"Snapchat scares me,\" said Brian Street, a father of two Piccowaxen middle schoolers.\"I've seen several fights at school on Snapchat.\"On top of that, two staff members at St. Charles High School were injured Thursday after they intervened in a physical altercation between students that started over a social media post, according to a letter that Principal Tammika Little sent out to parents.\"Please monitor your child's electronic devices and social media accounts,\" Little said.MENTAL HEALTHNot surprisingly, school officials in Charles County and elsewhere are alarmed at how social media affects child development and mental health. That concern is also reflected in the lawsuit, which alleges that companies are aware of the negative impacts the platforms have on children's mental health, but they choose to prioritize profit.Students go through developmental changes from elementary school to middle school, where their focus shifts from their parents to their peer group. Navarro said this is when children start pushing their own boundaries and understanding how to become an adult.As students become more self-sufficient, they begin building confidence - but social media usage during this stage can interrupt a child's growth, Navarro said.\"A fake reality, at those pivotal developmental ages, has more of an impact on behavioral health,\" Navarro said. \"It also isolates you.\"Navarro said social media augments the insecurities children face at pivotal ages, and research seems to prove that point. Researchers at Facebook found that Instagram, in 2021, made one in three girls feel worse about their bodies, according to the Wall Street Journal.Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic further isolated children and left many in a more fragile mental state.According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2021, suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 14.Charles County educators said social media contributes to the mental health crises that some young people endure. Inappropriate social media interactions continue to create disruptions in the buildings all over the county because children these ages are not developmentally ready for the responsibility, Davis said.\"Students lack the maturity to be able to handle social media,\" Davis said.That being the case, Davis said schools must make mental health a priority or else their true purpose will not be achieved.\"We are here to educate students,\" Davis said. \"If students are not in the right mindset, then it's much more difficult for them to access education.\"Searching for solutions While voicing support for the lawsuit, Charles County educators are looking elsewhere for more prompt solutions to the problems social media causes in the classroom.Davis pushed for parents to be a part of the solution.\"You pay for the phone, you own the phone, put some apps on there that allow you to control access,\" Davis said.Parents should be monitoring their kids' devices to make sure they're safe, Davis said, and it is not just her who feels this way.\"It's not a school thing, it's a parent thing,\" Street said.He said that while he does monitor his kids' social media usage, it is a parents' decision on how active they want to be in controlling it.Navarro said Charles County Public Schools has many resources for parents to learn how to be tech savvy so they know how to keep their children safe. In addition to limiting screen time, she said parents should be encouraging their kids to physically play, talk and participate in sports and extracurricular activities with other kids.Navarro said when to allow children to have devices is a parent's choice.\"My job is to inform and educate them about the implications of those decisions,\" Navarro said. She said she wants students to reach their full potential, but right now social media makes it harder for them to do that.That's where the lawsuit could help.Navarro said that if the district gets any compensation from this lawsuit, the school system intends to expand resources for the growing needs of behavioral health.And even in these early stages, Navarro said, the lawsuit serves an important purpose.\"It sends a message,\" she said.The message: that everyone - from social media companies to educators to parents to students - must be alert to the harm that social media can do to young people. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Level one is a \"beginning learner,\" level two is a \"developing learner,\" and level four is a \"distinguished learner.\"Students who fall into levels 3 and 4 are considered proficient in the subject. In Dorchester County, the percent of students that fall into level 4 for the English language arts and math categories are between 0 and 5%.For the level three proficient learner category in English language arts, compared to Spring 2022 data:\u25aa Third graders increased to 31% from 26.4%.\u25aa Fourth graders increased to 32% from 27.6%.\u25aa Fifth graders increased to 33% from 26.8%\u25aa Sixth graders increased to 33% from 22.2% - a 10.8% increase.\u25aa Seventh graders decreased to 20% from 24.1%.\u25aa Eighth graders decreased to 27% from 29.2%.Along with seventh and eighth graders, there was a drop in the percent of proficient learners for the English 10 assessment compared to the previous year. The percentage dropped from 36.4% to 35%.Colman said the state average growth for English language arts was 2.9 percentage points.Dorchester County's average growth was 4.1 percentage points, she said.\"So we grew significantly, or doubled, the amount that the rest of the state did,\" she said. \"It put us at the eleventh spot [in the state] as far as growth is concerned.\"Laura Aberg, DCPS supervisor of reading and English language arts for K through 12, spoke after Colman presented on the English language arts data.\"I'm excited to see all the growth for our younger students,\" she said.\"Our secondary students, we need to do some work to get back to the levels of growth that we like to see.\"Aberg said the district has implemented more diagnostics at the beginning of the year to identify those \"reading gaps\" so they can be addressed sooner for secondary students. She also talked about getting ready to enroll students in grades six through eight, as well as tenth graders, in MCAP tutorials.Aberg said she hopes to see even greater growth for younger students in the future since the district has implemented a foundational reading program that aligns with the science of reading, or the research behind how students learn to read.Board Member Theresa Stafford asked Aberg what the district did differently last year that might be attributed to the growth in proficiency for elementary students.Aberg mentioned multiple changes including the use of DIBELS test data to \"help drive instruction\" and getting teachers trained in the science of reading.MATHWhen it came to MCAP math assessments, grade seven and Algebra I saw significant increases in proficiency. The percentage of seventh graders that were considered proficient learners increased to 11% from less than 5% the year before. The percentage of Algebra I students that were considered proficient learners increased to 10% from less than 5% the year before.For grade six, there was a decrease in proficient learners, compared the year before, from 10% to less than 5%.For the other math assessments in the county, there was a mix of slight increases, slight decreases and constants in the percentage of proficient learners compared to the previous year. These include:\u25aa Third graders decreased to 20% from 20.3%\u25aa Fourth graders increased to 15% from 14.6%\u25aa Fifth graders increased to 14% from 12.2%\u25aa Eighth graders stayed at less than 5%\u25aa Geometry students stayed at 0%\u25aa Algebra II students decreased to 0% from less than 5%Colman said that while the state average growth for math was 2.5 percentage points, Dorchester County grew 2.0 percentage points.DCPS is focusing on improving math scores for third graders, sixth graders and Algebra I students this year, she said.\"Those were kind of the focus areas as far as the data,\" Colman said.She said there is a focus on third grade because it is the first group of students to take the MCAP assessments and there is a need for those students to gain a better understanding of the assessment.At the middle school level, Colman said the math coach is working with teachers and modeling lessons. The math coach is also working and planning with Algebra I teachers.\"So she's kind of targeted certain grade levels to try to impact some of this data,\" Colman said.After Colman's presentation on the math data, Board Member Chris Wheedleton talked about the importance of recognizing the data, good and bad, and talking about how the data can be improved for next year.\"I'm really pleased to see what you all are doing with this, how you've organized it,\" he said. \"But then, it's really about the action.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Carey Wright appointed interim state superintendent\n\n October 6, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 540\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Maryland State Board of Education voted unanimously on Wednesday evening to appoint Carey Wright as the interim State Superintendent of Schools for the remainder of the current term through June 30, 2024. Wright will begin her service as state superintendent by Oct. 23, 2023, pending the completion of onboarding logistics.Most recently, Wright served for nine years as the state superintendent of schools in Mississippi.\"I am honored to be appointed to this position and am excited to work on behalf of the teachers, leaders and students of Maryland. Maryland is well-positioned to provide a world-class education system for all its students and to ensure each student's success,\" Wright said. \"I am confident that by establishing strong relationships and partnerships across the state we will witness strong, equitable educational outcomes for our students. I welcome the opportunity to be an active participant in this endeavor.\"Under Wright's leadership, Mississippi's Quality Counts grade for education improved from an F to a C, improving its ranking from 50th to 35th. Her work reform efforts to improve literacy instruction for children Pre-K through third grade produced significant improvements in literacy rates in Mississippi, with the largest gains in fourth grade literacy on the National Assessment for Educational Progress.\"I am thrilled to welcome Dr. Carey Wright as Maryland's Interim State Superintendent. She is an exceptional leader who will guide Maryland's education system into its new chapter,\" Gov. Wes Moore said. \"Dr. Wright brings exemplary expertise to this role and I am confident that she will be a dedicated leader committed to transparency, accountability, and partnership to improve education outcomes in every corner of Maryland, just as this state deserves.\"Wright has long been an enthusiastic advocate for early childhood education and in Mississippi implemented the first publicly funded Early Learning Collaborative program, which earned the state recognition from the National Institute for Early Education Research as one of only seven states in the nation that meet all or most quality standards for early childhood education.Wright brings to the position decades of service as a Maryland educator with stints in Prince George's, Howard, and Montgomery County Public Schools as a teacher, principal, director of special education, and associate superintendent. Prior to serving as superintendent in Mississippi, Wright served as the chief academic officer in DC Public Schools. Wright obtained her bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park.\"Dr. Wright is a Maryland educator and a national leader of education reform. She has the experience and expertise to lead Maryland through implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and through our state's commitment to educational equity and improving outcomes for all students,\" State Board President Clarence Crawford said. \"We are confident in her ability to lead our school system through this transition period, to be focused on transparency and accountability, and to continue building towards the improvements in results in our schools that we all know are necessary.\"Wright will receive a salary at an annual rate of $350,000, which will be prorated to the amount of time she serves from now through June 30, 2024. The joint State Board and MSDE Transition Team will support Wright as she is onboarded, and the national search for a permanent state superintendent of schools will continue in the coming months. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'We will celebrate some of the books that have been challenged' - Library director 'shocked' by efforts nationwide to remove controversial books\n\n October 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Laura Tayman | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 791\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Kent County Library's Executive Director Arnessa Dowell participated in \"7 Questions to Ask the Library's Executive Director,\" while traveling to the branches of North County, Rock Hall and Chestertown and sharing her ideas with county citizens and answering questions they had. Kent County News had the opportunity to ask her questions as well.Dowell was hired in early 2021, when the Kent County Library, like everything else across the country, was trying to adapt to the new norm of living with Covid.Q: What has been your biggest challenge as Executive Director?A: \"I got acclimated to everything very quickly,\" said Dowell. \"I oversaw the return of the senior team, putting library staff in place, and finally opening the branches back up.\" Dowell thanks the community for their support and was pleased that the library has since increased its growth.\"We've definitely seen an increase in library patrons, with over half the residents now owning a library card,\" she said.As the world began to get back to the new normal, Dowell and her team shifted focus to upgrading technology and making more of it available to county residents. Today, she and the library's board of directors are now working on improving their current program offerings; developing solutions to the issues raised by patrons in a recent survey; and focusing on how the library is identified in the community today.Q: What are you focusing on currently?A: \"I want residents to feel we are inclusive,\" said Dowell, \"like our libraries are really for everyone.\" New programming, a new website, and more technology for increased access to information for residents are planned for 2024. There are also ongoing discussions about future plans for the Rock Hall branch location.Q: Why did you become a librarian and why did you come to Kent County?A: Dowell says she was born in Mississippi, but grew up in Germany with her military family.Most of Dowell's extended family lived in Maryland, and she moved back and started working at Goucher's and then Towson's libraries. When her mother became ill, it was her librarian friends that got her through it. \"They were wonderful and really made me want to work in that profession,\" said Dowell.Her commitment to increasing the opportunities for residents of a rural area is why she took the Executive Director position in Kent County. She cited examples that have been put in place to support that goal, like the Kent County free laptop program and expanding the e-library offerings.Q: What has been your greatest success so far at Kent County Library?A: Dowell was very excited about the results of this year's summer reading program. Over the course of nine weeks, registered summer readers embraced the \"All Together Now\" theme at 75 summer library events.\"Last summer, readers logged over 700,000 minutes, so this summer we set our sights even higher at 850,000 minutes,\" said Dowell. \"The final count for this summer was over 900,000 minutes read!\" Q: What is coming up in the fall for Kent County Library?A: Dowell said all county libraries of Maryland have partnered with Maryland Humanities in the \"One Maryland One Book\" program that aims to bring communities together through the shared experience of reading, discussing, and exploring the themes in a single book. This fall's chosen features author Tommy Orange's work \"There There.\" Released in 2018, the book tells the stories of twelve Native Americans as they converge toward the Big Oakland Powwow. Critics have called it \"a riveting portrait of the urban Indian experience.\" I'm excited to share that the Kent County Library will hold a special presentation with Chief Donna Wolf Mother Abbott, the first Female Chief of the Nause-Waiwash Band of Indians,\" said Dowell, \"She will be speaking about the past, present, and future of the Nause-Waiwash on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\" Q: What is your feeling about the movement to ban books in other areas of the country?A: \"I am just shocked,\" said Dowell. In fact, Kent County Library will be participating in the American Libraries Association's Banned Books Week this fall. \"We will celebrate some of the books that have been challenged that are still on our shelves. Books help people learn and open a door to creativity,\" Dowell said. \"I believe that everybody deserves a voice, and I feel like representation matters.\" Q: What is your favorite book?A: Dowell said the answer was a simple one-\"Oh, the Places You'll Go\" by Dr. Seuss. \"It's really the theme of a library's purpose,\" said Dowell. \"A really good book or technology at your fingertips can take you anywhere in the world.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nArnessa Dowell, executive director of Kent County Library, visited all branches last week to provide information for and to get input from library patrons. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Open to students across the Shore, including Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot, working individually or in groups, Junior Division (grades six-eight) and Senior Division (grades nine-12) students select a topic related to an annual theme. Information on the competitive event is distributed to students by their history teachers.The 2024 NHD theme is \"Turning Points in History.\" There are five different types of projects that students complete: documentaries, exhibits, performances, and websites that can be done as a group or individually or papers that may only be done individually.Research is key, so the two teachers partnered with the public libraries in the participating Upper Shore counties of Queen Anne's, Kent, Talbot, and Cecil.\"Schools have limited research options,\" said Hayman, \"so we turned to the county libraries who have more resources.\" During the fall season, as students begin picking a theme and looking for information, the teachers make themselves available at libraries across the region on specific dates so that librarians and History Day staff can provide assistance with finding research options, accessing online databases, or browsing materials.Hayman said the students learn valuable skills \"like how to analyze information, to make sure sources are reliable, and to form their own opinion.\" Last weekend, Hayman and Anders visited Queen Anne's Library on Kent Island. Next up is the Talbot County Free Library in Easton on Oct. 21 from 9 a.m. 1 p.m.; Queen Anne's County Library in Centreville from 9 a.m. 1 p.m. on Nov. 4; and the Learning Resource Center at Chesapeake College on Nov. 12 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.The actual contest is March 23, 2024, at Chesapeake College. Judges from the Upper-Shore community include teachers, professors, and museum staff. Students who place are then able to participate in the state finals on May 4 at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.The hard work of Hayman and Anders has paid off. \"We saw that at the beginning the winners were always from the western shore,\" said Anders.\"Now we send more students to the state event than everyone but Baltimore County.\" Hayman said the program helps make history more real and interesting to students.\"You don't usually have students thrilled to be in history class,\" said Hayman. \"Students who participate sometimes find their true passion.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nThomas Hayman and Andy Anders, both history teachers at Centreville Middle School, visit Queen Anne's County Library Kent Island branch on their first stop helping students from the Upper Shore with their History Day project research. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Washington College receives $54.7 Million from Hodson Trust - Guarantees $30k+ scholarships for students with a 3.3+ GPA\n\n October 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 10 | Section: News \n \n 492\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN - Washington College announced the largest gift in the College's 240-year history: a $54.7 million gift from The Hodson Trust to provide financial support for students. The Hodson gift will grow the College's scholarship endowment to approximately $170 million and its overall endowment to $325 million, strengthening the College's ability to make a college education more affordable to students from all backgrounds.\"This generous gift from The Hodson Trust is truly transformative for Washington College,\" said President Mike Sosulski. \"Access to an outstanding educational experience is a pressing issue for many families today. The Trust's support of our students' financial needs expands our ability to ensure access to a wide range of potential students, particularly those who are first-generation or come from underserved communities.\" As a result of the Hodson gift, Washington College will guarantee a minimum scholarship of $30,000 per year ($120,000 over four years) to any incoming student with at least a 3.3 grade point average who applies by Dec. 1. Students may qualify for more aid based on their academic performance. The Hodson Trust Washington Scholars endowment, which provides full tuition, fees and the cost of room and board for students with significant financial need, will also benefit from this gift.\"We are excited to be able to offer this scholarship opportunity to deserving students,\" said Vice President for Enrollment Johnnie Johnson. \"It will allow us to continue to grow the diversity of our campus community and enhance the intellectual environment of the College. These scholarship funds will help us recruit more of the best and brightest students to Washington College from Maryland, the mid-Atlantic region, and beyond.\" Support for financial aid opens new opportunities for students and their families who think an education at a private college is out of reach.Because private colleges like Washington provide significant student financial aid when compared to public universities, the cost of a private education becomes more affordable. For the current academic year, Washington College provided $40.6 million in total financial aid with the average student aid totaling $45,745, compared to the University of Maryland, whose published average student aid is $9,074.The gift is part of the dissolution of The Hodson Trust. Established in 1920 by Colonel Clarence Hodson, the Trust has been a longtime supporter of Washington College and its largest benefactor, having now donated more than $150 million to the College since 1935.For almost 90 years, The Hodson Trust has contributed to Washington College in a number of ways, including establishing or contributing to endowments that support student scholarships; undergraduate research and internship stipends; faculty chairs, salary enhancement, and professional development funds; and the College's signature academic centers. In addition, The Hodson Trust contributed to the construction of Hodson Hall, Hodson Boathouse, the John Toll Science Center, and the Lelia Hynson Boating Park.The Hodson family has a long and illustrious legacy at Washington College.Colonel Hodson, his daughter, Lelia Hodson Hynson, and granddaughter, Sally Hynson Hopkins, served on the Washington College Board of Visitors and Governors. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chapel District Elementary renovation design plans move to state for review\n\n October 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 568\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - The Talbot County Board of Education approved the design development submission for the Chapel District Elementary School renovation and addition at a Board of Education meeting Wednesday evening.The design development plan needs to be submitted to the state for review by Nov. 1. TCPS Director of Operations Kevin Shafer said this submission is the next milestone in the design process.Before the board voted unanimously to submit the design development plan, Shafer and Adam McDonald, project manager and architect from design firm Hord Coplan Macht, gave a presentation to update the board on plans for the project, including the schedule and estimated project costs.McDonald explained that the project includes a full renovation of the existing building and 16,600 square feet of additions.Three total additions at different corners of the building will add additional learning space.\"The additions are also going to help us enhance the overall design of the building,\" McDonald said.Since the board's last update on project plans, McDonald said they have made changes to the addition on the north corner of the building to \"work better with the existing utilities\" during construction.A traffic pattern has been formalized, and a first submission has been made to the State Highway Administration to create an additional curb cut to separate the parent entry loop from the bus drop.\"To help alleviate some of the traffic concerns that come with a shared entrance,\" McDonald said.The design plans for outside also include an extension to the parking lot to provide more space for parents dropping off students.Inside the building, McDonald said that most spaces will remain in the same areas as they are pre-renovation.The main change, he said, is that the media center will move to the front of the building and the art classroom will take over where the current media center is.Currently, bidding for the project is expected to take place in April and May of 2024. Construction would begin in June of 2024 and is estimated to take about two years.The estimated cost of construction and site work is $25.18 million. State and county funding for this will come out of FY2025 and FY2026 budgets. With additional expenditures, for things like design costs, the project is expected to cost $29.97 million.Shafer said this estimated cost is $1 million less than the state projection for the project.\"So I feel like we're within where we want to be,\" he said, adding that this is still just a projection and the real numbers will come when they bid the project out.After the presentation, board members asked questions.Board Member Deborah Bridges asked about the plan for the school's roof.\"The slanted roofs really have me worried,\" she said, expressing concern about drainage.Shafer said the pitched roof is not near the courtyard.\"The architect will make sure that any kind of drainage that's coming off the roof, whether it's roof drain or exterior drain, is properly sized to accommodate that water shed,\" he said. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nAdam McDonald, project manager and architect from design firm Hord Coplan Macht, updates the Talbot County Board of Education on design plans for the Chapel District Elementary School renovation and addition project at a Board of Education meeting Oct. 18.\n \nCOURTESY OF TALBOT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS\n \nA rendering of what the front of Chapel District Elementary School would look like based on renovation and addition project plans. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "It's in the family - Anna Howie speaks on joining Board of Education\n\n October 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 551\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Education is in Anna Howie's blood.Specifically, Talbot County education is in Anna Howie's blood.Her grandfather and mother taught in the district.Her mother was even her sixth grade language arts teacher at Easton Middle School.When Howie, the newest member of the Talbot County Board of Education, went to college, she wanted to be an engineer.However, a career in education just kept chasing her.In college, she became involved with something called 'The Algebra Project,' where she taught students algebra concepts.For a college internship, she worked with students at a middle school.At a college ministry meeting, Howie remembers the speaker saying, \"someone in here, you're an engineering student.And you know God told you you're supposed to be a teacher.'\" Although she graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in engineering, she unsurprisingly found teaching eventually. Her first job in education was teaching at a middle school.Now, Howie is the curriculum supervisor of career and technical education for Dorchester County Public Schools as well as the interim principal at Mace's Lane Middle School.Monday, she was sworn in to the Board of Education after being appointed to the District 5 seat by Gov. Wes Moore. The appointment comes after the resignation of Susan Delean-Botkin, the previous District 5 board member.W hen she learned of the appointment, Howie told her husband first. He was so excited he switched a flight he had for a conference so he could watch her get sworn in on Monday.Howie herself was excited and honored.\"A little scared at the same time, because this is a huge undertaking and it's extremely important,\" she said.Howie talked about the importance of being able to support students' social and emotional and mental health, especially after COVID-19.\"Schools are safe places for a lot of our students,\" she said. \"If I'm hungry, if I'm angry, if I don't know where I'm going to go to sleep tonight, I can't learn.\" Social and emotional learning is one of the Board's priorities this school year. Its other priorities are increasing academic achievement and teacher retention.\"There are teacher shortages everywhere right now, and it's so important that we retain the teachers,\" she said.\"Because when you have to continually hire new teachers, there is that onboarding process and there is that learning curve.\" Joining the board, Howie is continuing her mother and grandfather's legacy in Talbot County Public Schools.When Howie was 18, her mother died from breast cancer. She remembers the funeral being \"packed\" with former students and teachers from the district.\"There are teachers in this school district that knew my mom when she was here and they come up to me all the time and they're like, 'Your mother would be so proud,'\" Howie said, tearing up.With two meetings under her belt so far - a work session on Monday and a regular meeting on Wednesday - Howie is feeling welcomed by her fellow board members.She appreciates the organization of the meetings.\"Everything went very smooth,\" she said.Although she's been on the board for less than a week, Howie has already been thinking about whether she will run for the position when her seat is up next year. She doesn't have an answer yet, though.\"I have definitely, definitely put a lot of thought into that,\" she said. \"This is such a wonderful opportunity.\" \n \n Caption: ANNA HOWIE \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Sessions were offered for a myriad of STEM related topics, including 3D printing and the makerverse, Python coding, and lego robotics GeoCaching, a CDL simulator, a tour of the Health Professions laboratory and an Art and Sciences tour were also offered. The event has seen steady growth since its inception in 2017.Part of the Maryland STEM Festival 2023, sponsored by University of Maryland Extension, 4-H, and Family & Consumer Sciences, Navonne Owen, UME/4-H educator for Caroline County, heads up the event, along with a crew of dedicated educators from the Mid-Shore and the college.Owen estimates this year's attendance topped approximately 250 students and adults. She was happy to say, \"Many of the attendees come year after year, especially the younger folks who have an interest in STEM related topics.\" \"We hope to offer topics here to augment what students are exposed to in school, or topics which might ignite an interest - maybe prompting students to go out and discover more about a topic on their own,\" she said.When asked about the role Chesapeake College was playing in the event, Owen was quick to say \"Chesapeake College has really grown a lot in recent years. It's a hidden diamond here on the Shore - a resource which is sometimes overlooked. There are so many options here now for local students, with cost effective options for completing various fields of study.\" Maryland 4-H has long been a champion of STEM education, offering comprehensive support to engage young people in these critical fields.The program's commitment to fostering STEM skills and interests is evident in a variety of initiatives and activities designed to inspire curiosity, innovation and lifelong learning.To this extent, 4-H offers a wealth of STEM-focused clubs and projects, providing youth with opportunities to explore their interests in subjects like robotics, computer programming, environmental science and more.These clubs allow for hands-on, experiential learning that goes beyond the classroom.4-H hosts STEM camps and workshops that immerse young participants in the world of STEM through engaging and interactive activities.These programs not only educate but also excite and encouraging youth to pursue further studies and careers in STEM.With the help of educators like Owen, 4-H organizes and supports various STEM competitions and events, such as science fairs, robotics challenges, and engineering contests. These competitions promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork.For more information on similar events or for the 2024 STEM Festival, contact the University of Maryland Extension for Caroline County 4-H Office at 410-479-4030 or by emailing Navonne Owen at nowen@umd.edu. \n \n Caption: ERIC SYLVIA\n \nEmory Woods examines a slide through a microscope while mom Stephanie and Vicki Burchfield of the Caroline County Public Library look on. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The date is significant because fighting between the Allied countries and Germany ended on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, marking the end of World War I.\"Stop and think about this day, Veterans Day, celebrating all the service and all the sacrifice of the U.S. Military Veterans,\" Feehley said to the students. \"Veterans sacrificed so that you and I have the freedoms we enjoy today.\" Each of the seven fifth-grade classes at the school provided one question for the veterans to answer.Brian S. asked \"what advice would you give an individual who was considering entering the military?\" Jasiah P. asked \"what is the most positive thing that happened to you because you served in the armed forces?\" \"The military gave us the chance to do something we had never done or would never do, like go to the Philippines, or for me, to learn about C-4 and other demolitions, fly in planes and helicopters, or be on a ship.\" said Mike Detmer, a former Marine and member the Dorchester County Council.\"It also gives you a chance to grow close to people. When you go through training and hardship or danger with other people, just like when you're on a football or soccer team, you feel a closeness with them. I have brothers who I love a lot, but I feel extremely close to my Marine brothers.\" \"When you have served in the military, you know that you've accomplished something,\" Detmer said, \"and you are serving something much bigger than yourself.You can see how proud all of these gentlemen are about what they've done. But it's not as much pride in what they personally have done, as it is pride in what they have been a part of. That is why I would encourage you to think about it.\" At the end of the assembly, the students presented cards to the veterans, which will be delivered to patients in a Maryland VA hospital during the holidays.\"Students in fifth grade across Talbot County write letters to veterans as part of their fifth grade service learning project,\" said Jeff Bell, Easton Elementary fifth grade teacher. \"It is only appropriate that we get those letters to veterans at this time of the year.\" \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF TALBOT COUNTY SCHOOLS\n \nStudents in fifth grade across Talbot County write letters to veterans as part of their fifth grade service learning project.

Board President Emily Jackson introduced the motion at Board of Education meeting Wednesday.\"I would like to create a committee focused on special education,\" she said. \"As we all know, looking at Blueprint, the way that we are doing our budget and our funding is going to change.\"The Blueprint for Maryland's Future is a statewide plan to increase public education funding, improve student outcomes and improve the quality of public education. Jackson said this change in the way the budget is done means that there would not be a lot of specific line items \"directly applicable to special education\" in the budget.\"Combine that with the fact that our special education population has been growing rapidly,\" Jackson said to explain why she sees a need for this committee.Jackson said she would like the committee to do a holistic deep dive into what TCPS is currently doing regarding special education as well as what they could be doing. She said she would like the committee to look into modernizing the district's practices and come up with a full proposal for modernizing and funding special education in the county.\"I think that we all have talked a lot about how we need to approach special ed,\" she said.Jackson said she would like this committee to spend the year gathering information and come back next year, before budget season, with a proposal that includes what it would cost to modernize special education programming and how the district could fund it. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTalbot County Board of Education President Emily Jackson speaks about the need for a Special Education Committee at a Board of Education meeting Nov. 15. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Girl Scouts care for furry friends\n\n November 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tamara Forte; Special To The Kent County News Star Democrat | Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 536\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN - Excitement filled the Animal Care Shelter for Kent County in Chestertown on Nov. 11, as Claire Anderson-Schultz, Amelia Beach, Clara Gerber and Ayesha Tapia brought in lots of handmade supplies and needed items to the shelter. These four sixth graders earned their Bronze Award for Girl Scouts by setting their sights on helping the cats and dogs at the shelter.To earn their Bronze Awards, the girls from Troop 899 in Centreville had to complete 20 hours of service in a service project. Sharing a love for animals, it was easy to decide that the project would help animals in need. Claire's mom shared that Claire has been visiting animal shelters for years with her grandfather to spend time cuddling the animals after school.This past summer, the girls toured the facility to learn about what the shelter did and what it needed. From June to September, the girls worked independently and as a team to meet these needs. After reaching out and doing research, the girls learned the ACSKC had recently moved into a new building and had many needs.These needs included: a new cat tree, cat and dog toys, pet food and treats, new storage benches, and cleaning items. The girls explained the shelter had to throw out a beautiful, carpeted cat tree due to a sickness that had hit the shelter. The girls quickly began their mission to make a cat tree that was easy to clean and maintain.During these 20 hours or more of time, the girls strategized in meetings (in person and on Zoom) on how to meet these needs and then worked together to create and build the items needed. The cat tree was thoughtfully made, and with a little help from their parents, the girls found a plan that would use easy-to-clean PVC pipes. After making sure the pipes fit, they glued them together and painted them gold. The girls also made Velcro patches of fabric from reused clothing. \"These fabric patches were made from my grandpa's old jackets and now they can be velcroed off and on for easy washing\" explained Amelia.Shelter worker, Paige Tucker, said they currently have 109 dogs and cats at the animal shelter. Right now, there are 32 animals in need of homes. Allison Otadan, Shelter Media Coordinator, shared the shelter is \"so grateful for the efforts of the girls\" for the new cat trees and other pet items. She is excited for the new benches, as the current benches are all scratched up. At this shelter, there are special rooms for the animals to freely roam, but that also causes some of the items to get worn down and scratched. In addition to the cat tree and wooden benches, the girls sewed catnip toys, hand tied snuffle mats (where pet treats can be hidden and found), and collected lots of donations from their whole troop, grades kindergarten through fifth grade.If you would also like to help the shelter, they are currently in need of kitten food, cat food, dog food, and cat/dog treats. There is a complete Wish List on their website that includes the specific brands needed at https://acskc.org/ \n \n Caption: TAMARA FORTE\n \nThe girls get to play with the cats that need homes at the shelter. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He reached out to Leslie Sherman, the W. Alton Jones Professor of Chemistry and Environmental Science for Washington College.\"Advanced Placement courses are college-level work for high school students,\" said Geoffroy. \"I wanted my students to have the experience of using up-to-date technology and learn the processes of lab procedures, like independent work and safety.\" After donning goggles and lab coats, students began working with a freshman Chemistry class (led by the college's Chemistry lecturer Betsy Moyer-Taylor, the mother of one of the participating students, and assistant professor Jeremy Bard). Students were grouped with college students to complete the lab assignment of changing copper into various forms.A special visitor dropped by in the morning, Frank Keegan, Professor of Chemistry, Emeritus at Washington College who taught chemistry for over 40 years. Ceegan had a special visit with high school student Lucy Taylor, daughter of Moyer-Taylor, one of his former students, noting there were three generations of chemists there that day.\"I thought everything was pretty cool,\" said high school student Katie Harvey. \"The equipment here is way more advanced.\" Students were working with multiple modern \"hoods\" or ventilated enclosures throughout the room used to trap and exhaust vapors and gases, something that most high school classrooms today cannot afford to provide.High schooler Raven Fairbanks said that she felt comfortable with the process. \"We are following the same procedures we do in class.\" College student Terrance Vincent said he liked working with the younger students. \"It's keeping me honest,\" he said. \"I have to make sure everything is being done correctly.\" A brief Q & A with three upper level Chemistry majors followed with a tour of some of the fancier equipment in their facilities.\"My students loved hearing from the college students, and especially seeing that they were all double-majors. After our previous 'careers in chemistry' activity, I think it helped them to see the 'bridge' between themselves and those possible careers,\" Geoffroy said.Much of the discussion focused on the college students' workload (one was a student-athlete), as well as internships, jobs after college, and how their personal connections with their professors and advisors have helped them get those opportunities.Students were then treated to some liquid nitrogen demos from Sherman, applying some of the topics they had learned already.\"The big hits though were making (and eating) liquid nitrogen ice cream, and experimenting with different slime recipes,\" Geoffroy said.The group ended the trip with free t-shirts and lunch in the college's dining hall.Geoffroy said, \"We had many discussions during and after the trip about college in general, and it sounds like Washington College did a great job selling itself to some of our students.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nQueen Anne's County High School students Lucy Taylor and Hailey Gill and Washington College chemistry student Tarance Vincent watch for chemical reactions in a joint lab last week. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We want every kid to experience these things that will help them to make prudent economic career decisions.\" Orr said the group of four is currently working on bylaws. The purpose of the foundation \"shall be to enhance, inspire and support educational opportunities in the area of financial literacy for all students attending Caroline County public schools,\" he said.On Nov. 16, Rowe said, \"The four of us decided that, at least at this point, it would be more impactful to focus our efforts on a specific area like financial literacy, as opposed to everything, because we just don't have a lot of money.If we get more money, then we can expand the mission, but for right now we're going to hold pat with financial literacy.\" Rowe said the founders \"will be setting up a meeting soon get our bylaws adopted and make decisions as to who could serve with us.If anyone knows of anyone in the community that would be good for this organization, we would love to have a conversation.\" \"Times are changing, and this financial literacy piece is going to become so important and we're going to grow this fund,\" said Cole, chief financial officer of WIN Transport, Inc. in Federalsburg.\"Financial literacy obviously is very powerful,\" Simmons said.\"Caroline County is still one of the only systems in the state that requires all of our high schoolers to complete a full credit of a finance course before graduation, and I'm glad we have that, but at the same time, one only has to look at the current economic situation we're in to realize that one credit during your high school experience in one county on Maryland's Eastern Shore is not solving a fiscal issue that's in front of us everywhere.But financial literacy is a massive undertaking and needed.\" Simmons explained that CCPS was the first to sign a memorandum of understanding with Junior Achievement of the Eastern Shore regarding providing students opportunities at the organization's 25,000 square-foot regional facility under construction in Salisbury.\"It's a great center, but it's also a great program that they put together, working with businesses and communities across the Eastern Shore (and it's) great, strong curriculum coming in,\" Simmons said. The curriculum aligns with the Maryland State Department of Education's requirements.He said the foundation would be in a good position to help with costs associated with students getting to the facility.\"We are the furthest distance from the center and we have the highest degree of poverty,\" Simmons said. \"We're the (school) system that has the most need with the least amount of funds to spend to get our kids there, and we have the greatest distance to drive to get there.\" He added that the Blueprint, which requires career exploration as well as dual enrollment, also requires counties to fund compliance with the legislation.\"We're required to pay for everybody's dual enrollment who are enrolled in our high schools,\" Simmons said. \"The math in Blueprint doesn't add up. They did not take financial literacy.\" \"That's where Blueprint stands right now, and we'll do our part,\" he said. He added that the foundation could \"help support other things that we're trying to do.\" \n \n Caption: SCREENSHOT\n \nDenton businessmen Bob Willey, at the lectern, and Tolbert Rowe on Nov. 7 explain how the Caroline County Education Foundation will fund financial literacy efforts for students. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hale and the class were excited to make this idea a reality.Since then, AMP cabinets with dartboard with darts included have been one of AMP's most popular products, selling out even before they were presented.Each time AMP students manufacture a product, they follow the same template.It begins with research, mood-boarding and a product pitch. With dartboards, students research the history, rules and professional leagues in the game of darts. Then each student must come up with a design for the project, followed by drafting their design and placing it on a Mood Board.This Mood Board becomes a visual they can refer to as they present their product pitch.Business partners, school officials, parents and former students are then invited to watch the students' product pitches Oct. 26.One by one, students manage the difficult task of individually pitching the details and merits of their designs to the class and guests in attendance.At the end of the presentations, everyone votes and a design is chosen.The next step in the process is called \"napkin sketching,\" which is a sketch of the product views and dimensions.These sketches are then taken to the computer aided drafting lab, where more accurate prints are made. From those prints, numeric commands are created that will drive a computer numeric control machine, which is a robot programmed to cut pieces out of stock material.Once complete, an audience is once again assembled for student presentations of the finished products, which are also offered for sale. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF CCPS\n \nAdvanced Manufacturing Program students at Caroline Career and Technology Center presented design ideas for their current project, a dartboard cabinet, on Oct. 26.

Com | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 718\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN - This past September, Ashley Singer was holding a tutoring session with a student when they both began to sense a mechanical burning smell.After exiting the building and calling 911, they waited as local responders arrived.Crews quickly gained control of the smoke situation, but the damage had been done.Singer, Executive Director of Open Doors Partners in Education, said it was a saddening setback. \"Though we had insurance, there was an estimated $40,000 loss of materials due to exposure to toxic smoke.\"Enter Associate Director Julie Blyman who had served as a crisis manager at a school.\"It was really catastrophic,\" said Blyman, \"but then we got so much support from the community.\"Singer and Blyman met when they were at the Radcliffe Creek School. The school provided them literacy training and both found early on that tutoring was what they were meant to do. Their Open Doors Partners in Education is a literacy focused organization, founded in 2020 as a direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting learning loss in local schools.As graduates of Kent County Public Schools and residents of the county, they were alarmed to watch students who were already struggling fall even further behind.\"We felt the need to do something to help and the decision was made to create a literacy focused nonprofit organization\" said Singer. \"We initially wanted to help students in first and second grade, a time when intervention can be most efficient and successful,\" said Singer, \"but as word spread through the county, students of all ages, pre-k through 9th grade, were found on our roster.\"To date, the organization has assisted over 100 students in the Orton-Gillingham literacy method, a direct, multi-sensory, structured, sequential, diagnostic and prescriptive way to teach literacy when reading, writing, and spelling that does not come easily to individuals, such as those with dyslexia.When the fire happened, the two were amazed by the support of local community organizations, including Washington College, the YMCA, and Stam's downtown.It took only one day for them to take an offer from Emmanuel Episcopal Church to use their Sunday school classrooms.Knowing that they needed a more permanent location, the group worked with Sam Shoge of Rivers & Roads Construction to find an appropriate location. They toured office space in the Lynchburg building and worked with KRM Development Corp. to get the space ready as soon as possible.Open Doors depends on grant funding to exist and has worked with Kit Cares, Inc., a charity navigator and a fiscal sponsor for their 501\u00a93 organization. The funding provides the organization the ability to offer free services to Kent County students.\"By partnering with local schools, we can provide intensive 1:1 structured literacy instruction at no cost to the families,\" said Singer.\"We hope to reach those students who might otherwise fall through the cracks.\"The organization is also working with a nonprofit consultant on a strategic five-year plan. \"We would love to be working more with Kent Co. and Queen Anne's County Public Schools,\" said Singer. They would also like to enhance their bilingual program. \"Research says the Orton-Gillingham literacy method is the best literacy training program for bi-lingual students,\" she said.Since the fire, the organization is in need of replenishing their paperback book library for students ages 5-16. The organization also has a wish list on Amazon.com.Why are Singer and Blyman so committed to their mission? Singer said, \"It is the lightbulb moment when students discover why they want to read, when they realize that a book is an adventure, and they realize they can have many more.\"Blyman said it is all about why students come to the office for a session. \"To know that they are coming here willingly after a hard day of school, that is really inspiring,\" said Blyman. \"And it's very rewarding when we see that parents are so relieved that their children are ok to come here and know they will get the help they need.\"The Open Doors Partners in Education will have a ribbon cutting at their new location, 116-D South Lynchburg Street in Chestertown, on Dec. 1 at 5 p.m.For more information on Open Doors, go to www. opendoorsed.org. \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nAshley Singer, executive director, and Julie Blyman, associate director of Open Doors Partners in Education have opened their new location in Chestertown after a fire displaced them from their original office. \n \n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

From military and law enforcement to county government and local businesses who are needing workers with specific skills, all were on hand to answer questions and discuss options for the future.One of the presenters was Connie Dean, the Career Technology Liaison for the Queen Anne's County Economic & Tourism Development department. Dean is assisting the two schools with finding businesses who are interested in the apprenticeship program.\"Students are first given skills that would be required to work in a certain business field,\" said Dean. Then the students work 450 hours at a partnering business to earn their official apprenticeship recognition.\"I try to tell businesses internships are a bigger commitment, when the apprenticeship program would be appropriate for future workers in their field,\" she said.Currently, there are three Kent Island students who were trained in the culinary department at Chesapeake College this semester.Aly Swann said she learned about the basics like cutting meat, how to work with knives and other kitchen tools, and how to make sauces. \"I know now 100% that this is what I want to do for a living,\" she said.James Smith said the school was really helpful in letting him work some during the school day. \"I appreciate that I got a pathway for my career. I have learned skills I will use for a long time,\" said Smith.Last Tuesday, was military and law enforcement day for the Queen Anne's apprentice week, with recruiters from all armed forces branches, answering questions about basic training, money for college, and traveling the globe.Troopers Christopher Bekefiand Doug Prince provided information on the Maryland State Police Cadet program, where students aged 17-19 are assigned to perform duties that do not require police authority (example helping with crowds at large public events). Cadets are also assigned to work under the supervision of a Trooper at a truck inspection station or on patrol.They also have an explorer program for students aged 14-18, where they are introduced to various divisions and tactics like crime scene investigations, traffic stops, and forensics.Adam Tolley, supervisor of Career and Technology Education for Queen Anne's Public Schools, was pleased to see so many students engaging with a variety of workforce representatives. \"This is a very organized way to provide students who are beginning to think about real career options,\" he said.County Commissioner Philip Dumenil was present to view the new apprentice week program first hand at Queen Anne's High School. \"I like new opportunities for exposure to these kind of programs,\" said Dumenil. \"Lots of money can still be made in the trade fields. Not every kid wants to go to college.\" Queen Anne's student Austin Hahn, just a sophomore, has already chosen a career for his future, and that, said Ricketts, makes him a perfect apprentice candidate.Hahn has chosen to pursue a career in marine mechanics and pipe welding and wishes to move to the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana or Texas where he has family. \"My grandfather taught me a lot about it,\" said Hahn. \"He said it would be the best money I could ever make. When he passed away, I knew I would definitely do it.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nNew Career Coach Betsy Ricketts stands beside the poster for Queen Anne's County High School's first apprenticeship week schedule. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "MCAP results show signs of recovery from pandemic learning loss - Science scores still show decline\n\n November 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Aya Hussein; Capital News Service | Page: 27 | Section: News \n \n 840\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n COLLEGE PARK - The results for the 2023 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program tests for grades 3 to 8 show that student proficiency in English Language Arts has surpassed the level it was at before the pandemic.Math scores have improved, but have yet to fully rebound from the pandemic, while science scores have declined, according to the Maryland State Department of Education.MCAP tests are administered annually in public schools to assist educators in understanding student progression so that they can better tailor their methods of instruction, according to MSDE.Students in grades 3 to 8 take tests in English and math, while students in grades 5 and 8 are given an additional science test.ENGLISH PROFICIENCY SURPASSES 2019According to data from MSDE, average English proficiency dropped from 44% in 2019 to 31% in 2021.Proficiency increased significantly in 2022 and by a smaller degree in 2023, with results showing an average passing rate of 47%, according to MSDE.Improvements can be seen across Maryland, as every county except Somerset had an increase in English proficiency between 2022 and 2023.MATH PROFICIENCY STILL BELOW PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELSThe 24% average passing rate for math in 2023 is still lower than the 31% in 2019, indicating that math scores have still not fully recovered from pandemic learning loss.Despite average passing rates in math still not being as high as in 2019, they have gone up since dropping to 15% in 2021. Proficiency increased by 6 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and 3 percentage points from 2022 to 2023.Not every county had an improvement, as there are four counties that saw a decline in average math proficiency from 2022 to 2023: Baltimore, Kent, Somerset and Talbot.Baltimore County Public Schools Board of Education Member at Large Tiara Booker-Dwyer said that an explanation for the slower improvement in math scores is that the format of math questions in these tests have become more layered, which makes it difficult for parents, teachers and administrators trained in the traditional format to help students get accustomed.HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED STUDENTS LAG BEHINDDespite making improvements over the last two years, average scores for historically underserved students in English and math still lag behind. The most recent scores of Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino and American Indian/Alaska Native students are still below those of white and Asian students.Booker-Dwyer said that it is important to build the cultural competency of educators so that they can connect better with students.\"When you look at the curriculum that was developed, it speaks to a certain demographic.There are certain people who just 'I'm not going to connect with this,' so it's going to go in one ear and out the other. Or when they try to connect to it, people recognize that it's inauthentic,\" Booker-Dwyer said.Booker-Dwyer states that another solution is encouraging more historically underserved students to take honors and AP classes, as well as providing resources to schools to give them these opportunities.\"What the research shows is that if you're placed in an advanced academic class or gifted class, even if you're earning C's in there, you're better off long term than if you're just in the standard class,\" Booker-Dwyer said.\"Sometimes it's just exposure to certain things, just being in a classroom, around students who are performing at a certain level will kind of unintentionally make you perform at a higher level,\" she said.GRADE 8 SCIENCE PROFICIENCY HITS FIVEYEAR LOWScience scores continue to lag, especially for grade 8.In grade 5, science proficiency in the last five years peaked in 2021 at 41%, a 12-percentage point increase from 2019. In 2022, the passing rate dropped to 31% before rising again to 35% in 2023, according to MSDE.Grade 8 scores have been on a steady decline since 2021, with the passing rate dropping from 35% in 2022 to 26% in 2023, the lowest it's been in the last five years.With the exception of Dorchester, every county had at least a 10% decline in grade 8 science proficiency from 2022 to 2023. Six counties had over a 30% decrease from 2022: Kent, Charles, Prince George's, Washington, Allegany and Queen Anne's.MSDE states that this decline is likely due to the grade 8 students being in grade 6 during the 2020-2021 school year, which was predominantly online. As a result, students missed key science instruction during their first year of middle school.\"The results on the grade 8 assessment make clear the impact of grade 6 and 7 disruptions on a cumulative grade 8 assessment,\" MSDE said in the press release.Booker-Dwyer stated that rollout for the new Next Generation Science Standards for K-12 education, which has lessons in engineering, technology, earth and space sciences in addition to traditional sciences, was delayed by the pandemic.She remains optimistic that scores will improve as curriculum continues to change.\"I do believe it will get better as people are getting more and more comfortable with the science standards and more teachers are getting trained and the resources are getting better, as far as the instructional material,\" Booker-Dwyer said. \"But initially it was tough.\" The 2024 MCAP tests are set to begin in the spring. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now, they are peeling the skin off Caroline County grown sweet potatoes to create more sweet potato pies to keep up with holiday demand.\"We are processing some baskets of sweet potatoes today. We also have some pumpkins getting ready for our Christmas Bake Sale.We do biscuits again and fresh apple cakes and carrot cakes and pumpkin maple torts and an array of cookies. We have between 75 and 100 kids involved,\" said Linda Brown, who teaches the class and has been teaching culinary arts for over four decades.For some of these students, she taught their parents.Francis Blazejak, a retired police officer, delivers a delicious, smaller varietal of potatoes. He donates all the potatoes not fit for sale to the Easton High culinary program.They are steamed and peeled and processed to a smooth paste in a blender.\"This morning there were three dirty boxes of potatoes as if they were just dug out of the ground.The kids washed them and dumped them into a big sink and got them into the steamer,\" Brown said.The culinary instructor said there is no room in her kitchen for laziness. Everybody was quiet and focused on their task as radio station WCEI plays Christmas ditties in the background. There was an earthy, sweet scent in the air, and everyone's fingers were dyed orange.\"We put between five and six apples in each pie, depending on the size of the apple,\" Brown said. \"You can think of how many apples we peel. I go to PA and get my apples because they are right off the tree, and I use a variety, so it has some golden delicious and some tart granny smiths.\" She loves working with the students, seeing them take pride in sliding out a sheet tray of six pies and knowing they have 94 more to go.Although this effort is geared towards the holiday season, Brown sees a larger picture of success.Many of her students go on to culinary schools. Some of her students have gone on to work at the Inn at Perry Cabin is St.Michaels.\"We are preparing them for working in a restaurant or going to college in culinary,\" Brown said.\"Chesapeake, Anne Arundal, but most of our kids go to CIA (Culinary Institute of America) or Johnson and Wales. It sets you up for school or to be industry ready.Our program is way more flexible, so we a get much more flexible student population.\" \"They establish a lot of pride and get some interest in doing it right,\" she said.This is her 48th year of teaching.Her right hand man is her former student Joseph Candel, who went to the Baltimore International School. He has worked in kitchens in Ireland.Candel was working as a sous chef in Cambrige and had only been there for ten months when he got a call. It was former EHS Principal Tim Thurber who told him a spot had opened up a couple of days before school started.\"This was a great opportunity.I had to do some soul searching, you know, I have taken every opportunity that I can, to better myself. That was 18 years ago,\" said Candel. He still thinks he made a great decision.Candel and Brown share a philosophy, \"Mise en place,\" which is French for everything in its place.Like in carpentry, they believe in measuring twice and cutting once.Harlin Bartolon is a sophomore at EHS and is fully invested in working in the food industry.\"I have learned how to properly measure stuff, how to cut properly and how to do the stuff right in the kitchen. I want to go to Johnson and Wales University in Rhode Island,\" Bartolon said.\"They have more opportunities to do stuff internationally. They can get you jobs all over the world - like internships.\" He peeled a lot of sweet potatoes, and there was a mountain of orange flesh at his station. He seemed relaxed and focused as the skin fell away.\"It is easy if you use the back of the knife to peel. I hope we inspire kids to cook. Inspire them to do better in life,\" Bartolon said.\"The community really likes to buy the pies to support the program.The money that we take in on bake sales, that is the money that pays for our supplies. We charge $8 for a pie, $5 for a dozen biscuits and $4 for cookies,\" Brown said.The bakers take orders by phone at 410-822-6965. They can't handle much more demand, Brown said, so there have been no holiday ads on Facebook.They make fresh pies on Mondays and Tuesday. Their last holiday deadline is Dec. 14 for Dec. 19 delivery. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nLinda Brown, EHS culinary teacher, shows off one of culinary student's pies.

We're fully aware that that's going to be a very big lift for us.\" Beachy said that for the two years following 2024, \"without another funding stream becoming available, we will drop back down to three elementary schools with a total of 400 students.\" In other business, the commissioners approved a $1,011,834 contract with Nashville-based Wellpath LLC to provide medical services for inmates at the county jail.Two surplus vehicles will be offered for sale, deemed by the County Commissioners to be \"no longer needed, outdated, unsafe, or (their) condition has deteriorated to the point that maintenance costs exceeds its practical value.\" A 2012 Dodge ambulance with 211,797 miles and a 2014 Dodge Ram with 218,742 miles will be auctioned locally.Ryan White has left his position as director of the Department of Public Works, and that position may be reconfigured before it is advertised.Commission Vice President Larry Porter expressed some concern about \"the scope of what is going to be able to be done by public works.\" \"At some point, in my opinion, (it's) going to have to be reduced. There's going to have to be more things contracted out,\" Porter said.Commission President Travis Breeding said, \"I've been giving this position a lot of thought, and I think it would be helpful to have someone there who is wellversed in the design process, permitting process, bid process.I almost feel like it's a two-person role.\" The next Caroline County Commission meeting will be held 9 a.m. Tuesday, Dec.5, in Room 106, Caroline County Courthouse, 109 Market St., Denton.Meetings are held 9 a.m.Tuesdays except the fifth Tuesday of the month, unless announced otherwise.

    "content": "School principals prepare for the Blueprint For Maryland's Future\n\n November 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Cait Kelley And Caley Fox Shannon | Page: 12 | Section: News \n \n 777\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OCEAN CITY - As Maryland rolls out the 2021 landmark education reform law called the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, many school administrators are unsure what the plan means for their schools.At the annual School Leaders Conference held Nov. 2-4 in Ocean City, state officials and school principals reviewed the details of the Blueprint and discussed how it will be implemented in each school district.The wave of impending policy changes are meant to address the challenges facing educators and students across the state.The Blueprint is grounded in the analysis of a group of independent policy experts formed by the state in 2016 to establish a baseline for education reform.The group was commonly referred to as the Kirwan Commission after its chair, William E. Kirwan, chancellor emeritus of the University System of Maryland.By 2019, the Kirwan Commission had come to some sobering conclusions about Maryland's education system.Half of all teachers leave the profession within the first five years. Only two out of every five kindergarteners arrive in the classroom ready to learn. And just a third of students leave high school being \"college and career ready\" in English and math.\"That was pre-pandemic.So generally speaking, it's gotten worse,\" said Rachel Hise, a policy specialist who worked for the state in tandem with the Kirwan Commission.Explaining the commission's findings to school leaders in Ocean City, she said the independent body concluded that \"ultimately, the status quo is unsustainable.\"The Maryland General Assembly passed the Blueprint for Maryland's Future in February 2021, overriding a veto by then-Gov.Larry Hogan, a Republican who had cost concerns about the plan.The Blueprint allocates $3.8 billion to schools over the next 10 years.Hise is now executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board. She said the policy changes will make sure students are ready to learn in kindergarten and ready to succeed when they graduate high school.Because public schools lack the capacity to fulfill this mandate alone, the state will fund programming via private pre-K providers as well.\"The goal is a socioeconomically integrated pre-K system that is publicly funded, but that is provided by both public schools and private providers,\" Hise told administrators in Ocean City.The Blueprint will also mean big changes in high schools.\"What the Blueprint really envisions is we want kids to be college and career ready by 10th grade, so that the second two years of high school students can focus on the pathway that they're interested in pursuing,\" Hise said.The Blueprint aims to meet this goal through curriculum changes in English and math in addition to apprenticeships and technical education programs.Implementing the Blueprint at the school level falls squarely on school administrators, said Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\"There was no doubt that the Blueprint would be a part of this conference, and the understanding of the Blueprint is actually key,\" she said in an interview.After learning more about the Blueprint at the conference, some principals said they are hopeful that the reforms will address their schools' priorities.Teachers are struggling to make do with salaries in the current economy, said Principal Ryan Daniel of Fort Foote Elementary in Prince George's County.\"I know a lot of my teachers have to have after-school jobs or second jobs to compensate for their salary,\" she said.The Blueprint will raise the minimum salary for teachers to $60,000 across the state by 2026. And if teachers obtain National Board Certification, the Blueprint allows them to earn up to an additional $17,000 per year.Other schools have yet to feel the concrete impact of the Blueprint.\"Honestly, I'm still reading and learning, and I think that they're doing a really slow roll out intentionally for us, which is good,\" said Jamie Miller, the principal at Broadneck Elementary in Arnold. \"We have people at the board level who are becoming sort of experts and then they're going to disseminate to us.\"Miller expressed a mix of excitement about the expansion of pre-K and trepidation about her school's capacity to meet the need.In March 2023, every school district submitted a detailed plan to the Accountability and Implementation Board for rolling out the Blueprint in their schools.\"The plans are fine, but they really are a baseline,\" Hise said. \"There's a need for more innovative thinking.\"The Accountability and Implementation Board expects updated plans from every district in March 2024, and has offered every district a $100,000 grant to hire a strategic planning expert. All but Frederick and Worcester counties took the state up on that deal. \n \n Caption: Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board, presents on Maryland's plan to improve early childhood education. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Ccps Sophomores Explore Career Options At Rotary Fair\n\n December 6, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 14 | Section: News \n \n 562\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - Caroline County Public Schools sophomores explored career options at the Denton Rotary's 2023 Youth Career Exploration Fair Nov. 21 at the General James F. Fretterd Community Center.A number of Caroline County Public School sophomores had the opportunity to visit with representatives from a variety of businesses and attend workshops to help them explore career possibilities before they graduate from high school.Hosted by the Rotary Club of Denton, the 10th Grade Career Exploration Fair was sponsored by Smiles by Holsinger, Shore United Bank, Summit Community Bank and Sisk Fulfillment.The Denton Rotary has been providing this yearly event to 10th grade students since 2013; however, the COVID pandemic temporarily suspended it.\"The purpose of the event is to spark an interest and open up career possibilities to our 10th graders so they can be career ready when they graduate,\" said Sue Simmons, a Denton Rotarian and the event chair.This year was the highest attendance ever, with 97 students from Colonial Richardson High School, North County High School and the Caroline Career and Technology Center, who were split up into groups for the day. Nearly 30 small and large businesses set up vendor exhibits.Each group was assigned to a table with a business mentor - an adult to help match them with possible careers that are compatible with their interests or expose them to new ideas and opportunities to consider.Students were encouraged to explore careers that match their personal interests, such as working outside, being a problem solver, caring for others or owning their own business.Each student also attended two of the four workshops that were offered. Workshops included \"Unlocking Your Potential at Chesapeake College\" by Marci Leach, director of program development at Chesapeake Community College, and J.P. Kelly, business and industry navigator at Chesapeake Community College; \"Mental Health Means Inner Wealth\" by Sara Porter-Lepore, LCSW-C, and Cara Calloway, mental health coordinator for CCPS; \"How To Rock a Job Interview\" by Deborah Boulden, youth outreach coordinator for the Upper Shore Workforce Investment Board; and \"Way to Be: Exploring Career Interests\" by Abigail Trice, Next Generation Scholars coordinator for Caroline County.Participating students also had the opportunity to meet students from other schools, as each group was pre-assigned to their tables by Lindsey McCormick, CCPS director of college and career.Ten juniors who attended the fair last year returned as mentors to help guide the sophomores through the day.A bonus to the program was a special visit from Devon Beck, an NCHS graduate, songwriter, hip hop artist, podcaster and Talbot County Public Schools Equity Facilitator. Beck shared with the students his own story and provided a positive message about being true to themselves and finding a career that is meaningful to them.The Rotary Club of Denton thanked Dr. Derek Simmons, McCormick and Robert Gowen from the CCPS Board of Education; Eric Cook, Ann Ferkler, and Brad Plutschak from CCPS; as well as table mentors Danielle Forrest of Shore United, Linda Prochaska of Appleseed Books, Victor Reynolds of CASA of Caroline, Richard Warfield of the Caroline Review, Esther Curtis of SUN Behavioral Health), Desiree Jefferson and America McKinney of His Hope Ministries, Kristi English of APG Media Chesapeake, Angel Perez of the Caroline Culinary Arts Center, Kat Stork of Shore Strategies LLC, and Sarah Kilmon of Talbot County Communications. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF DENTON ROTARY\n \nCaroline County sophomore explore career options with local businesses and organizations Nov. 21. \n \n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Superintendent Outlines Budget Priorities, Timeline",
    "date": "2023-12-13",

    "content": "Superintendent Outlines Budget Priorities, Timeline\n\n December 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; Cconnolly@Chespub.Com | Page: 15 | Section: News \n \n 785\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - The conundrum of uncertain Blueprint demands coupled with a projected decrease in pandemic-related grant funding for Caroline County Public Schools is proving to be a challenge for Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons, school administrators and district staff as they build a budget for fiscal year 2025.And because the dilemma impacts the traditional budgeting timeline employed in previous years, at the Dec. 5 meeting of the Caroline County Board of Education, the Superintendent Simmons received more time to develop a more realistic budget.\nThe Board of Education approved Simmons's request to revise the traditional timeline and move his final budget proposal from February to April.\n\"We do not have a good idea of what state revenues look like until the General Assembly gets done doing their work, which is April,\" Simmons said.\nWhile some demands of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a set of policies and spending for education in the state's public schools, are clear, others are still being modified. The \"uncertainties\" of the unfunded legislative mandate have created budgetary challenges for school administrators across the state.\nOne of the demands for school districts is funding dual enrollment for high school students who wish to take college courses. Blueprint's College and Career Readiness standards require school districts to pay for any student who meets the minimum requirements for dual enrollment. At roughly $1,000 per student per semester, CCPS spent $130,000 in 2023 for juniors and seniors to take courses at Chesapeake College. While \"it's great for the kids,\" Simmons said, the Blueprint requirement presents a budget challenge.\nAnother \"cost of doing Blueprint business\" is meeting the mandated starting teacher salary of $60,000 by fiscal year 2027.\nGrant funding \"is kind of how Caroline County has survived,\" Simmons said.\nBut some of that funding will decrease or cease altogether in 2024.\nBoth American Rescue Plan and Maryland Leads grant funding will sunset in Sept. 2024. In addition, the funding formula for Blueprint shows a 1.7% increase in state funding from last year, the lowest per year increase in the formula, Simmons said.\nThe CCPS budget, typical of school systems across the state is 80% people, Simmons said.\n\"The rule of thumb is anywhere between 80% to 90% of your budget is people, and when you take people out and you take out paying for your electric and your fuel and heating your buildings and running your buses and those sorts of things, you're probably left with somewhere between the neighborhood of 5% to 7% every year that truly is discretionary,\" Simmons said.\nAnd while \"about 14% of our money comes from the county government, the rest of it comes from state and federal, which is also why those numbers are important,\" he said.\nMost categories in Blueprint require financing at the school level, adding additional elements of complexity and compliance, and requiring full time accounting level position, Simmons said.\nBesides Blueprint's requirements, budget pressures also include the rate of inflation at over 3.5%, multiyear contracts that will come up for renewal in 2024 that will likely be higher than the rate of inflation and global issues impacting the cost of goods, including fuel.\nHowever, the budgeting challenge is not \"all doom and gloom,\" Simmons said.\nCaroline County has schools that qualify for \"concentration of poverty\" grant funding. While the funding is restricted to individual schools and can't support programs or positions at the district level, it helps take some pressure off the district to fund, for example, an afterschool program or reading intervention at a specific school.\nFederalsburg and Greensboro elementary schools already qualify; Colonel Richardson Middle School received its first concentration of poverty grant in 2023.\n\"It's likely we will see multiple other schools added as the Free and Reduced Meals rates maintain or increase,\" Simmons said. Because the concentration of poverty funding formula relies on Free and Reduced Meals data, Simmons said, \"I feel very confident all nine of our schools will get there.\"\nAs for the budgeting process, Simmons and his team will continue to work on the budget, try to find funding sources and work with the County finance office into 2024. Negotiating with the teachers' association will play a role, as well as a joint budget meeting with the Caroline County Commissioners.\n\"We also have a very good working relationship with the county commissioners,\" Simmons said. \"We are not one of those counties that walks over to the county commissioners and drops an additional increase of $3, 4 or 5 million on them.\" The final CCPS budget is due to the county commissioners by the end of June.\nPriorities in the fiscal year 2025 CCPS budget are competitive salaries and benefits for all employees, maintaining reasonable staffing levels across the district, maintaining high yield positions and programs that were included in pandemic-related grants and implementing the Blueprint as required. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "TCPS Gives Update On Its Priorities At Board Meeting\n\n December 15, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; Mtrovato@Chespub. Com | Page: 2 | Section: News \n \n 937\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - At a Talbot County Board of Education meeting Wednesday, administrators gave an update on the school system's priorities.Talbot County Public Schools' three priorities, identified in the spring, are academic equity and achievement, fostering an engaging environment and hiring and retaining highly qualified and diverse staff.\nSince sharing the priorities with the entire school system in August, Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said they have been working to \"infuse\" the priorities everywhere.\n\"In my roundtables, out in the community, in schools,\" she said. \"We're constantly talking about those three priorities.\"\nAt the meeting, strategies and metrics associated with each priority were shared.\nACADEMIC EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT When it comes to academic equity and achievement, TCPS has six strategies, including implementing additional interventions for students in and outside the classroom, hiring additional math coaches and implementing more assessments to measure growth.\nAssistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction Helga Einhorn said that since improving math was identified as a priority by the board, the district has added the NWEA MAP Growth Assessment for mathematics.\n\"Prior to this year, we did not have a standardized assessment that would allow us to collect this type of data as we had with reading,\" Einhorn said. \"We felt it was important, if we were going to make changes throughout the year, to progress monitor our students throughout the year.\"\nStudents in kindergarten through fifth grade took the beginning of the year MAP Growth Assessment for mathematics.\nEinhorn said teachers were impressed with how well students performed.\nOverall, 14% of those students were in the 80th percentile or higher, 19% were between the 61st and 80th percentile, 18% were between the 41st and 60th percentile, 21% were between the 21st and 40th percentile and 25% were between the 1st and 20th percentile.\nAlong with measuring growth through testing throughout the year, Einhorn said teachers are working very closely with the K-6 Math Curriculum Supervisor Daisy Bradwell.\n\"They are doing a deep dive into the curriculum,\" Einhorn said, adding that Bradwell is working with teachers to identify what things might be missing from the curriculum.\nFOSTERING AN ENGAGING ENVIRONMENT Director of Student Services Darlene Spurrier started off her presentation by listing different strategies the district is employing to achieve fostering an engaging environment.\nThese strategies include school-based mental health services and substance abuse intervention and prevention; restorative practices training; and individual school wellness plans and wellness coaches.\n\"Many of (these strategies) are ongoing and will not ever really move to completed because they're things that we're just going to continue to do,\" she said.\nWhen it came to data, Spurrier shared the results of three climate surveys - an internal survey from this year and the Maryland School Climate Surveys from last year and the year before that. Each of the surveys measure student and educator attitudes on four domains: community, environment, relationships and safety.\nComparing the student survey TCPS took this year to the state's survey from last year, within those four domains, students considered physical safety, physical environment and participation and engagement significantly better this year than the previous two years.\nComparing the teacher survey TCPS took this year to the state's survey from last year, teachers also ranked participation and engagement and physical safety significantly higher. They also ranked substance abuse higher than last year, meaning it is less of a concern in schools this year. Teachers ranked bullying lower on the scale this year compared to last year, meaning it is more of a concern.\nHIGHLY QUALIFIED AND DIVERSE STAFF Assistant Superintendent for Administrative and Support Services Lynne Duncan presented data on new hires, recruitment and TCPS's Grow Your Own Teachers Scholarship Program.\nBefore she spoke, Pepukayi said that retaining, not just recruiting, is important to the district.\n\"With the shortages across our nation in education, we want to make sure the people who are here, we're tending to,\" she said.\nAccording to Duncan's presentation, last school year, 197 out of 234 people, or 84%, accepted offers of employment.\nThis year, 90 out of 126 people, or 71%, accepted offers of employment.\nDuncan said that, to date, four of those new hires this year have left employment.\nIn terms of demographics of new teaching staff this year, 32 teachers are white and two are Hawaiian.\nTCPS attended seven recruitment fairs last school year. Duncan said it yielded one support staff employee.\nThe district plans to attend a total of eight recruiting events this school year. So far, it has visited three.\nOf the five people enrolled in the district's Grow Your Own Teachers Scholarship Program last year, four have been hired. The program gives TCPS students enrolled in college a scholarship if they agree to teach in the district after they graduate. Duncan said that of the nine remaining students enrolled in the program, one will graduate this month, one will graduate in June of 2024, three will graduate in 2026 and four will graduate in 2027.\nAt the end of the meeting, board member Jymil Thompson said he could see that the administrative team has clear vision, alignment and transparency.\n\"I think you all do a fabulous, fabulous job of that,\" he said. \"I want to see where the district's going to be in a couple years because I think it's definitely trickling in the right direction. So I'm anxious to be a part of that.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TRO VATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi speaks at a Board of Education meeting Dec. 13 in Easton.\n\n MAGGIE TRO VATO/MTRO VATO@CHESPUB.COM\n\n Talbot County Board of Education President Emily Jackson (pictured) and Vice President Candace Henry were reelected as president and vice president during a board meeting Dec. 13. \"It's a pleasure to serve in this role, and I'm excited to do it again for another year,\" Jackson said at the meeting. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Each bag came with the book, \"The Giraffe Who Found Its Spots,\" by Adisan Books, and a plush giraffe to nuzzle over the holidays.\nParents and friends interacted with professionals in the field over pizza, cookies and tiny juice boxes.\nElizabeth Tussing the Family Resource Center's parent coordinator and organizer said, \"This year we have Santa, and it's good because kids can receive individualized time with him. It's not a long line so they don't feel the pressure.\" Also in attendance were staff from all three Judy Centers in Kent County: Rock Hall, Chestertown and the newest, Galena.\nProfessionals from the Family Resource Center and Special Education Citizens Advisory Committee, (SECAC) were there, helping with the event and being a positive presence.\nFor those in the community interested, SECAC meets on the fourth Wednesday of each month at the Kent County Middle School.\nOn Jan. 24, starting at 5 p.m, Parents Place of Maryland will teach on the transition process for student's Individualized Educational Plans. \n \n Caption: WILL BONTRAGER\n\n Dad and mom, Michael and Aimee Boumiea cheer on their sons Benjamin as he creates his Christmas cookie and Emmett (not pictured).\n\n WILL BONTRAGER\n\n Supervisor of Special Education Wendy Keen and Coordinator of Special Education Erica Costa-Gooding match Emmett Boumiea's cheerful smile.\n\n WILL BONTRAGER\n\n Everybody can gather around Santa, even adults, especially dedicated ones like these educational professionals.

    "content": "Student published before graduation\n\n January 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 5A | Section: News \n \n 710\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Washington College junior Natalie Martinaitis has published her first book, \"The Post-PSO Project\".The novella takes readers to the far reaches of space, in a world where psychological experiments on children have been carried out simultaneously on Earth and Mars by the People Stimulus Organization (PSO).\nThe story follows Amelia, one of 10 children invited to join Capt. Karen McCall's mission to the Red Planet to explore outside the PSO site by attending Camp Red Sands, where they will build a model of the planet's surface.\nAmelia seeks to discover what lies outside the camp's perimeter.\nBut what lies beyond could end them all.\nPublished by World Castle Publishing, the book has been available since Dec. 11 as a paperback and Kindle eBook.\n\"The Post-PSO Project\" resulted from a novella writing class project at Washington College.\n\"I loved that I could write a book for a class,\" Martinaitis said. \"It was certainly challenging to get in 10 pages a week.\" The story takes place in a world Martinaitis crafted for two previous, much longer works, both of which have yet to find a publisher. Martinaitis first came up with the idea of the PSO world when a friend showed her a Pinterest post that read something along the lines of \"what if humanity had to judge each other after watching these movies: 'The Silence of the Lambs,' 'The Sixth Sense,' 'Titanic?'\" Contemplating that thought led her to draft a play which, she states quite frankly, she hated. However, she fell in love with one of the characters she had created, named Elliot Green - a gentle, passionate and kind soul, traumatized by forced experiments conducted by the PSO.\n\"I decided to write Elliot a book of his own, which I titled 'Elliot's Story.' It reached 800 pages,\" Martinaitis said.\nCalling it her magnum opus, she submitted the tome to more than 15 literary agents and was rejected every time. Undeterred and still inspired, she soon began another novel in the same world, about the antagonist from the first, Martin Woods. That book, \"Demons,\" is nearly finished.\n\"I thought these would be the only books within the world of PSO,\" Martinaitis said. \"But it turned out I was wrong. I had two dreams which featured the Mars landscape, and I knew they would have to become stories.\" Thus, The Post-PSO Project was born.\nHailing from nearby Columbia, Maryland, Martinaitis has been plugging away at making her dream of becoming a published author a reality, while also working to obtain her bachelor's degree and serving as the editor-in-chief of the Washington College Review.\nWhile most authors do not succeed in publishing a work until well into their 30s, Martinaitis shows no signs of slowing down in her success.\nShe's aiming to win the coveted Washington College Sophie Kerr Prize next year, the largest undergraduate literary award in the country.\nWhen asked about her plans after graduation, Martinaitis said she dreams of being a full-time writer.\n\"Natalie is a serious student in the best sense - she has a serious hunger for knowledge, a serious enthusiasm for conversation with her fellow students and a serious commitment for improving her writing and engagement with literature,\" said Washington College Department of English Chair Courtney Rydel.\nThat seriousness has paid off, and Martinaitis gives credit to the workshops and classes she has taken at Washington College and to Roy Kesey, associate director for the Washington College Rose O'Neill Literary House and lecturer in English and creative writing, for assisting with editing the novella and giving pointers on how to write a query letter to publishers.\nNow Martinaitis is turning her eyes to what's next for the literary world she has created.\n\"I hope that my books 'Elliot's Story' and 'Demons' will find their forever homes,\" she said. \"However, I also have interest in the editing world, so I may first begin in children's and YA editing.\" The College has a long history of literary excellence and has molded and promoted countless new and emerging writers, editors, and publishers.\nOn campus, Washington College's Rose O'Neill Literary House offers literary-minded students programming across disciplines, professional mentorship, guidance, and spaces to study and to hold class. Those interested in a degree or minor in English, creative writing, journalism or editing and publishing from Washington College's Department of English can learn more at washcoll.edu/academic departments/english. \n \n Caption: WASHINGTON COLLEGE\n\n Natalie Martinaitis \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Problems persist in juvenile services schooling\n\n January 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Steph Quinn; Capital News Service | Page: 10 | Section: News \n \n 569\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n SABILLASVILLE - The graduate's mom, peers and teachers knew he was going to reach his goal, though his principal, Todd Rasher, said the other students incarcerated at the Victor Cullen Center in rural northern Frederick County didn't see \"all the footwork\" it took to earn his GED.\"This diploma ain't really too much because I knew that I was going to get it,\" the 17-year-old said to his graduation audience on Oct. 18, wearing a cap and gown, kente stole and black wristband adorned with, \"Don't give up.\" The graduate, whose identity CNS is shielding because he is a minor, was charged as an adult before his case was transferred to juvenile court.\nRasher said he passed the tests necessary to earn his GED on the first try, inspiring his fellow students to take the tests themselves.\nNot all incarcerated young people are able to continue their education, much less attain a degree. Two years after the Maryland General Assembly transferred responsibility for incarcerated students' education from the state Education Department to an independent school board within the Juvenile Services Department, students confined in Maryland's secure youth facilities continue to face multiple long-standing challenges, according to experts and state audit reports.\nTeacher vacancy rates of 30% in the most populous Juvenile Services schools have led to reliance on streaming instruction in subjects such as math and science.\nDavid Domenici, director of education and senior adviser to the Juvenile Services secretary, said streaming instruction is \"not ideal\" for the \"vast majority\" of students but better than packets of photocopied activities.\nJuvenile Services teacher vacancies have persisted through tensions between Maryland's education and Juvenile Services agencies over the past decade about who bears responsibility for educating incarcerated young people and how best to do so. Those vacancies continue through teachers' lack of summer and winter breaks and low pay relative to teachers employed by local school districts.\nBills seeking pay parity and summer breaks for juvenile services teachers failed in 2016, 2019 and 2020, often pitting experts from Education and Juvenile Services against each other. The General Assembly established a statewide education board within Juvenile Services in 2021 in response to monitors' and advocacy groups' repeated findings of high staff turnover and vacancies, inadequate services for learning disabled students and a lack of support for students returning to community schools.\nBut the law did not require pay parity or align facilities' teaching calendar more closely with local schools.\nBut lost instructional time is greatest due to a lack of residential advisers, according to audits of Juvenile Services schools by the state Office of the Inspector General.\nDepartmental policy requires that residential staff escort students from their living units to classrooms while maintaining a minimum staff-to-youth ratio. When there aren't enough residential staff, students don't move.\nStudents were late to class 203 times across Juvenile Services facilities due to residential staff shortages between April and June alone, according to the audits. Teachers had to teach class inside the living units 43 times in the 90-day inspection period.\nGetting students in the classroom, even if they are late, Domenici said, is better than class on the living units.\nThe department is working toward a goal of 90% on-time attendance in school by shifting all onsite adults to escort students to school, he said. \n \n Caption: DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE SERVICES/ERIC SOLOMON\n\n Principal Todd Rasher congratulates a graduate at the Victor Cullen Center, a youth committed placement center run by Maryland's Juvenile Services Department in Sabillasville, on Oct. 18, 2023. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Radcliffe Creek School awarded 'social-emotional' learning grant\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Local News \n \n 534\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Radcliffe Creek School (RCS) was recently awarded a grant from the Queen Anne's County Mental Health Committee (QACMHC) to expand its social-emotional learning curriculum. The new funding will broaden the robust curriculum already in place for younger students, bringing social-emotional resources to older students and their parents, as well as to the local community.Social-emotional skills serve as a guide for people to understand social situations and relationships: these abilities are central to navigating the world successfully in everyday life. Debbie Cohee-Wright, a special education learning specialist at RCS explained, \"If a child has a mental health issue of any kind, such as trauma, depression or anxiety, their ability to learn and access information is compromised. For a student to be available for learning, they must first feel emotionally safe. Making connections with teachers and peers and building trust with others must happen before the focus on academics can take place.\"\nCurrently, the school's social-emotional learning program encompasses two curriculums targeted to younger students who are identified as needing support to strengthen these skills. The program, administered by Intervention Transition Skills Coach Bryn Ponti, utilizes fun, engaging activities that integrate kid- friendly themes: kids imagine themselves as detectives who look for clues in their environment or as superheroes who earn superpowers, all while learning about executive functioning, perspective taking and self-regulation.\nHead of School Peter Thayer said, \"At RCS, we always try to meet students where they are in their learning, and here, that includes their social-emotional wellbeing. This grant from QACMHC will make a considerable difference in the lives of our older students and their families, many of whom are neurodivergent and need extra support in this area.\"\nThe funding provided by QACMHC will bring two additional curriculums\u2014Brain Talk and Conscious Discipline\u2014to the school, expanding its social-emotional programming to older students and their families.\nBrain Talk is a curriculum designed to teach students about the different areas of their brains, educating children about their executive function capabilities and how they impact responses to situations.\nConscious Discipline is a course designed for teachers, parents and guardians, providing adults with tools to show children better ways to self-regulate and build resilience.\n\"These grants are made possible by community support of our fundraisers and through generous donations from local businesses and individuals,\" QACMHC President Kelly Phipps said. \"We appreciate the outpouring of support whenever we have a fundraiser or ask for donations.\"\nIn addition to the new resources this grant will provide to Radcliffe Creek School's teachers, students and their families, the QACMHC grant will allow RCS to bring social-emotional programming to the local community as well. Planning is already underway to host an event for the public, bringing this important topic to local parents, teachers and residents in 2024. \"We are so grateful to QACMHC for their support of our school's social-emotional learning program. These funds will directly impact our students' mental health by supporting children both in the classroom and at home, leading to a more positive school environment, a greater sense of empowerment among our teachers and parents, and an increased sense of confidence in our children. We are excited to bring these resources to the Radcliffe Creek School community and beyond in 2024,\" remarked Director of Advancement Carolyn Thompson. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Diving Deep' with dyslexia: Local special education teacher works to raise awareness\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TAMARA FORTE Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 1217\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE \u2014 What do Robin Williams, Jay Leno, Albert Einstein, Alexander Graham Bell, Magic Johnson, Jennifer Aniston, Gwen Stefani, Abraham Lincoln, and Arnold Schwarzenegger all have in common? They all have dyslexia.Lindsey Parte, a mother of two boys and Special Education teacher, has reignited the Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter that fizzled out during the Covid pandemic.\nParte shares that she has been \"diving deep into advocating and teaching herself (about dyslexia)\" for the last three years.\nWhen Parte's older son, Lincoln, was six years old, he struggled with both speech and reading. Parte said a red flag to her son's learning struggle was \"knowing how smart he was but not understanding why reading was so hard.\"\nParte explains that her two-year younger son was making gains on her older son. In contrast, reading was coming with ease to her younger son.\nOn the first day of second grade, Lincoln (her older son) came home and said, \"I can't do this. I can't read. I hate school.\" Lincoln was frustrated with learning and wanted to quit.\nIt was heartbreaking for Parte as a mother and as a special education teacher herself as no one wants to see their child struggle, especially with learning. Parte explained, reading is the gateway to learning and lifelong success, and as such, learning to read successfully is vital to all.\nTwo years after Parte first suspected Lincoln was dyslexic, Lincoln got his formal diagnosis. Parte explained that getting the diagnosis meant freedom for her and her son.\nShe recounts, \"I will never forget the utter sigh of relief when we told him he has dyslexia. It all made sense to him from that moment on. Within a week, he was already talking about it in class and advocating for himself. And most importantly, we got our boy back. His light turned back on.\"\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, dyslexia is \"a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). Also called a reading disability, dyslexia is a result of individual differences in areas of the brain that process language.\"\nAn MRI shows the physical differences in the brain composition of a dyslexic thinker versus a non-dyslexic thinker. Dyslexia is so common that one in five people are a dyslexic learners.\nWhat is it like to have dyslexia? How can I help and support a dyslexic learner? What are the early indicators of dyslexia? These questions and many others will be answered at 6:30 p.m., Feb. 20, at the \"Experience Dyslexia: A Dyslexia Simulation\" workshop at the Queen Anne's County Library Kent Island Branch location.\nThe free event, hosted by Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter, aims to raise dyslexia awareness, empower families to support their children, encourage educational interventions, and ultimately influence policy makers to support Maryland students with dyslexia.\nAll are welcome. The event will offer six stations to help understand the dyslexic learner: Learn to Read, Listen to Me, Write with Mirrors, Name the Letter, Write or Left, and Unfair Hearing Test.\nParte says,\"The two biggest takeaways I have learned over the last year of my deep dive into my son's brain and the way he learns are early identification is crucial (as young as five-years-old); and the dyslexic brain requires instruction to be explicit, systematic, cumulative and multisensory.\n\"It should integrate the teaching of listening, speaking, reading, spelling, vocabulary, fluency, handwriting and written expression. There should be an emphasis on the structure of language: phonology, orthography, morphology, syntax and semantics. Training teachers and educating parents is also of the utmost importance,\" she continued.\nSince then, Lincoln has helped his mom set up and lead workshops. In October, to celebrate Dyslexia Awareness Month, this mother and son duo led the Halloween-themed workshop entitled \"There is nothing scarier than not being able to read.\"\nParte believes in dyslexia awareness and education with her whole being, which is why she fundraised, on her own, to purchase the upcoming workshop materials.\nAfter more than three years of advocating, Parte promotes all adults to learn as much as they can by listening to podcasts, attending free trainings, reading books and fact sheets, and much more.\nMoving forward, what steps can we take?\n\"Release the stigma. Embrace the label,\" Parte said. \"The label means freedom. It gives a child the right to read. The right to appropriate instruction which in turns means success in reading and regaining self confidence. We got our child back the moment we told him he had dyslexia. The label opens a world of resources for your child to feel good about themselves. Priority is a child's mental and social wellbeing.\"\nDyslexic Learners have many strengths and show a lot of leadership skills. Some other positive skills of dyslexic learners include: problem-solving, big picture thinking, creativity, empathetic, and entrepreneurial skills.\nParte shared things parents can do to help their struggling reader if they suspect their child has dyslexia:\nTesting is everything. You will be surprised how relieved your child is with a \"diagnosis\".\nFinding the right intervention specialist (tutors in reading are not the same as someone trained and certified in structured reading interventions like Orton Gillingham). Tutoring at least three times a week is most effective. The key to remediation is \"go as fast as you can and as slow as you need to\". Early intervention is crucial especially to maintain your child's confidence in school.\nDeep dive in your own research. It will help with advocacy, ensuring the right assessments are being used, and knowing the right questions to vet organizations and other folks who claim to want to help your student.\nRead to your child not so they learn to read but so that they develop their reading comprehension and vocabulary while they are learning to read with appropriate interventions.\nIf your child receives the diagnosis of dyslexia, tell them, she encourages. Share all the amazing qualities a dyslexic thinker has and famous people who have dyslexia. Show them a photograph of a dyslexic brain vs typical brain.\nKnowledge and support in this process are so important. You don't have to go through this emotional journey alone. Connect with your local Decoding Dyslexia chapter.\nParte explains, \"Most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an important role.\nThough there's no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention result in the best outcome. Sometimes dyslexia goes undiagnosed for years and isn't recognized until adulthood, but it's never too late to seek help.\"\nCommunity support, awareness, education, and training will help all our learners learn in the best ways to be successful, happy learners. Together, we can impact our future and the future of our children. If you cannot attend the workshop at the library but are interested in gaining resources and learning more, you can email decodingdyslexiaES@gmail.com for more information and for a Welcome Newsletter with a list of more resources.\nCurrently, Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter is a grassroots movement (not a nonprofit), which means it has no funding and is paid for all out-of-pocket. It is run by parents who are also working professionals.\n\"The fight continues,\" Parte said, \"Until every single child (and their families) don't have to go through this hell and back to learn how to read.\"\nTo support and make a donation to Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter, you can also email Parte at the email above. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some of his doppelg\u00e4ngers even brought their own fake metal detectors \u2014 a hobby of Bailey's.\nAfter eight years teaching at DCTC, Bailey is hanging up his trowel and picking up his metal detector.\n\"You know, I love metal detecting, so I'll probably go find the Holy Grail or something,\" he said about what he will do in his retirement.\nWhen Bailey came in for his last day of teaching, right before winter break began, it took a little while for him to figure out what his coworkers had done.\n\"I'm like, 'Wait a minute, something don't look right,'\" he said. \"Then, when I saw the metal detectors, I was like, 'Ohh, they got me good!'\"\nDCTC Principal Ashley Robinson came up with the idea.\n\"I was just trying to really think about how we could celebrate his time here in a way that he would enjoy and that he would feel appreciated,\" she said. \"So I really thought the best way to do that would be with humor, since that's something he really enjoys.\"\nIn order to keep it a surprise, Robinson said she made it a part of the school's holiday spirit week.\n\"So he thought everyone was just dressing in comfy sweatshirts,\" she said. \"And I let everyone else know we were really just dressing like Mr. Bailey.\"\nBailey, who was surprised by his coworkers' plan, thought it was funny.\n\"It was so great because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said. \"I would have never expected that.\"\nBailey said he knew Robinson had something to do with it.\n\"She comes up with such cool stuff,\" he said, adding that she gave him a plaque with a trowel on it to commemorate his time teaching at DCTC.\nHe said there's a reason he would wear the similar outfit that his coworkers knew so well to work everyday.\n\"Working in the masonry, you can't really go in there with real good clothes on,\" he said. \"You gotta wear your oldest stuff. Like, inside my car, all you see is dust.\"\nRobinson said Bailey, like the rest of DCTC's staff members, epitomizes the importance of CTE education.\n\"The majority of the teachers here have worked in industry in their field, they have those life experiences and then they chose to come back and give back and work with kids to set them up to be successful,\" she said. \"We were happy to have (Bailey) and happy that he was able to do this.\"\nBailey has had a few different careers over the years. He owned a masonry business, was a prison guard and spent four years in the Marine Corps. But teaching is in Bailey's blood. His father taught at James M. Bennett High School in Salisbury.\n\"He was football coach, track coach,\" Bailey said. \"And we lived right across the street from Bennett, so I was at school every day. I knew it from top to bottom.\"\nHe has memories of cigarette smoke \"flying out of the teachers' lounge\" and teachers coming over to his family's house to play cards with his father.\n\"I mean, that was the good old days,\" he said.\nLooking toward his retirement, Bailey has plans to further explore the hobby his DCTC coworkers know he loves.\nBailey said the Career and Technology Center staff knew about his metal detecting because he would send them photos of some of his finds.\nOver the last five years, Bailey said he has gotten more and more into metal detecting. His neighbors, known as The Hoover Boys on YouTube, post metal detecting videos. They have over 100,000 YouTube subscribers. When they moved next door, Bailey said they started giving him their hand-me-downs.\nOver the years, Bailey has found all sorts of things \u2014 from shoe buckle frames to Civil War bullets to cannonballs. Two of his major finds were a rare George Washington inaugural button and a pine tree shilling.\nAlthough he has plans to do more detecting, Bailey said he'll miss his students.\n\"A lot of them played sports, and I'd hook them up with a sub,\" he said. \"It was always a sub, a red Gatorade, orange Doritos.\"\nAs he moves on to his next chapter, Bailey now has fond memories of his own teaching experience to look back on.\n\"Oh I loved it,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The announcement came at this month's Board of Education meeting. Board President Joe Goetz and Vice President Francoise Sullivan were re-elected to their positions during the Jan. 8 meeting as well.Couch said it has been an honor to collaborate with the exceptional team of administrators, teachers, staff and board members.\n\"Our collective commitment to the students and families of this county has been profound,\" Couch said. \"Throughout my tenure, we achieved significant milestones, a testament to our collective dedication to excellence in education. This commitment consistently drove us to adapt and innovate, ensuring our students receive the best education possible.\"\nUpon the delivery of Couch's announcement, Goetz, described the meeting as a \"heavy night\" with the weight of the superintendent's decision in the air.\n\"But you're not gone,\" Goetz told Dr. Couch. \"And we'll have time to celebrate and we'll have time to reflect on where we've been and where we're going.\"\nGoetz said everyone is a link in the chain driving KCPS, with many having come before them and more to follow. He said they will all do the best they can to continue providing students with a top-quality education.\n\"Working with you has been an absolute joy,\" Goetz said to Couch. \"There's been a lot of ups and downs, but we'll celebrate all that as we move forward.\"\nAs a first step in the KCPS leadership transition, the Board of Education is holding a special meeting at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 23 to discuss the search for the next superintendent. The meeting will be held at the KCPS Administrative Building, 5608 Boundary Ave., Rock Hall.\nCouch is retiring in the back half of her third four-year term as the superintendent of KCPS. Her most recent contract renewal was approved in the spring of 2021 for four years.\nShe first came on board at KCPS on July 1, 2013, having led a candidate field of nearly 20 applicants.\nCouch was named the Maryland Superintendent of the Year in 2021. She made her mark on KCPS early, launching a technological revolution by bringing computers and smartboards into classrooms, greatly expanding teachers' and students' access to educational resources.\nShe built a collaborative environment in schools through fostering professional learning communities, which brought teachers together to share best practices to help reach all students.\nShe also made KCPS one of the first school systems in Maryland to adopt universal all-day prekindergarten, giving children an important head start on their education. \"Amidst numerous budgetary challenges, including declining enrollment and limited resources,\nwe remained committed to prioritizing organizational improvements and addressing the diverse needs of our students and staff,\" Couch said.\nShe improved the school buildings themselves through targeted renovations, enhanced safety features like security vestibules and launching the planning process for a new middle school.\n\"During my tenure, we also executed a comprehensive six-year Facilities Strategic Plan,\nrevitalizing educational facilities untouched for over 25 years,\" she said. \"Moreover, we successfully fulfilled preliminary state requirements for the construction of a new middle school while advocating for legislation to increase state funding participation for the project.\"\nSullivan, praised Couch's professionalism in the face of myriad challenges including tight budgets, declining student enrollment and the COVID pandemic. \"You have helped our schools accomplish so much in the time that you've been here and it hasn't been easy,\" Sullivan told Couch. \"You have always been professional and represented our schools really well, and I can only imagine how tough that probably was for some things.\"\nHailing from New Mexico, Dr. Couch previously served from 2001 to 2013 as the superintendent of the Moriarty-Edgewood School District, about an hour east of Albuquerque. In 2010, she was honored as the New Mexico Superintendent of the Year.\nCouch moved to Kent County with a reputation for having turned that rural school district into one of the top-achieving in the state through a focus of continuous school improvement and the incorporation of research-based education programming.\nShe has likewise implemented similar strategies at KCPS, increasing the visibility and participation in the Career and Technical Education (CTE) program at Kent County High School, encouraging the growth of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs and training elementary school teachers in the renowned Orton-Gillingham method of English language arts instruction.\nTrish McGee, the longest serving among the current Board of Education members, was first elected the year after Couch's hiring. McGee covered the search process that saw Dr. Couch come onboard as the associate editor of the Kent County News.\nSpeaking at the Jan. 8 Board meeting, McGee said Couch paid out of her own pocket for travel from New Mexico to Kent County for one of her first interview visits. McGee said that showed just how prepared Couch was willing to go the distance to address the challenges faced by KCPS.\n\"I think every decision she ever made personally and professionally was really about how to move our school district forward,\" McGee said. \"And I can't think of a greater legacy than something like that.\"\nCouch's tenure at KCPS caps off a career in education that began in 1980 when she became a kindergarten teacher in the Las Cruces Public Schools in southern New Mexico. She was then employed by the Alamogordo Public Schools and rose through the ranks in that district from teacher to principal and, ultimately associate superintendent.\nAlong the way, she earned her master's degree and later received her doctorate in educational administration from New Mexico State University.\nCouch said she is confident that KCPS will continue to nurture and inspire every child who walks through its doors and she eagerly anticipates hearing all those future success stories.\n\"As I begin a new chapter, I know that our work has laid a strong foundation for continued student success,\" Couch said. \"The legacy of our efforts is not in the programs we've started or the facilities we've renovated, but in the lives of the students we've touched.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Blueprint Pillar Chairs Share Caroline's Progress",
    "date": "2024-01-17",
    "author": "Connie Connolly",
    "content": "DENTON \u2014 At the Jan. 9 meeting of the Caroline County Board of Education, several supervisors provided updates on progress towards meeting requirements of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a set of policies and dedicated funding seeking to transform several aspects of the state's public education system by 2026.Assistant Superintendent Dr. Tara Downes said the district has been receiving additional guidance from the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) and Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB) since spring 2023.\nAs a result, required tasks have been \"chunked out\" over a more manageable timeline, and the pillar chairs are \"actually ahead of schedule\" with some aspects of the plan.\n\"The pillar chairs have been phenomenal in being proactive when it comes to the work,\" Downes said.\nAccording to its website, \"The Blueprint for Maryland's Future was passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 to transform public education in the state into a world-class education system. The Blueprint will increase education funding by $3.8 billion each year over the next 10 years, enrich student experiences and accelerate student outcomes, as well as improve the quality of education for all children in Maryland, especially those who have been historically underserved.\"\n\"The Blueprint really involves everything that we're doing on a daily basis,\" said Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons.\nAccording to the Blueprint website, \"The bold work of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future is organized into five distinct pillars.\" Each pillar has a set of objectives to help administrators and educators align instruction and community support to them and determine needed resources.\nPillar 1: Early Childhood Education\nThe main focus of Pillar 1 is the expansion of pre-kindergarten for three-year-olds and four-year-olds, said CCPS Supervisor of Instruction Elizabeth Saylor, who serves as Pillar 1 chair.\nOf the 375 pre-K students enrolled as of Sept. 30, 58 are in pre-K three and 317 are in pre-K four. The main focus currently are Tier One families who are \"up to 300% of the federal poverty level, or 319 students. As of Jan. 9, 395 students were enrolled in pre-K,\" Saylor said.\nA challenge is the need for private daycare providers, who must follow Blueprint's criteria. Providing more qualified and more certified staff is another challenge both for Pillar 1 compliance and workforce development, an objective of Pillar 2.\n\"Making sure families and students are ready for kindergarten\" is ultimately the focus of the pillar, Saylor said.\nPillar 2: High Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders\nCCPS Supervisor of Human Resources Dr. Rob Willoughby addressed four objectives of Pillar 2, which focuses on the recruitment of high quality and diverse teachers and leaders.\nChesapeake College has been \"a fantastic partner with us through the Maryland Leads\" grant initiative, he said. The district recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Mount St. Mary's University, which offers a fully online bachelor's degree in elementary education.\nWilloughby's group is looking at other ways of providing staff and enhancing qualifications, including encouraging National Board Certified Teacher credentialing.\nForty-eight teachers are currently in the process of pursuing that certification. \"That is 10% of our teaching staff pursuing a really rigorous national certification,\" he said.\nA Pillar 2 challenge includes a starting teacher salary of $60,000 by Blueprint's July 1, 2026, deadline.\n\"Our starting teacher salary this year $53,167, and \u2026 we're about $6,800 to the end,\" Willoughby said. \"If you divide that over the three fiscal years we have, that means it needs to go up at least $2,278 (per year).\"\nPillar 3: College and Career Readiness\nBlueprint's third pillar focuses on students' college and career readiness.\nCollege and Career Readiness Director Lindsey McCormick explained the progress being made towards complying with Pillar 3 of the Blueprint as the district works under interim standards. Students are assessed at the end of their 10th grade year and can choose a career pathway. The district offers 16 Career and Technology Education (CTE) pathways.\nIn addition to pursuing a college track and taking advanced placement courses, students can receive career counseling. Students in AP courses are now required to sit for the exams in the spring; the tests are paid for by the district.\n\"I am very pleased to say that this year through our MOU with the (Upper Shore) Workforce Investment Board, we have added one high school and one middle school career coach that are in the buildings five days a week working with students,\" McCormick said.\nShe said the district is growing the youth apprenticeship program and modeling it for businesses.\nIf students are not college and career ready, the district is working on a pilot program to provide supports, including online study, to help them meet state standards, McCormick said. Chesapeake College supplied data from the past three years that showed students' learning online was just as successful as classroom learning.\nPillar 4: More Resources to Ensure that All Students are Successful\nPillar 4 of Blueprint seeks to provide students with more resources that could help them succeed.\nSupervisor of Instruction Christal Harkowa, one of the co-chairs for Pillar 4, updated the school board on multilingual learners.\nThe district has hired two multilingual learner family coordinators to work with Spanish- and Haitian Creole-speaking constituents.\n\"We have really been able to improve our communication with our families,\" Harkowa said. \"They are very dedicated; they stay after (school), they attend all kinds of after school events, parent conferences when we need them for 504 or IEP (Individualized Education Program) meetings to make sure our parents understand what the needs of their students are and to be able to advocate and ask questions.\"\nShe said her goal by the end of this school year is to \"identify MLL families for parent leadership opportunities.\"\nTo support MLLs in instruction and language acquisition, the district is providing ongoing professional development for teachers and instructional assistants while \"being respectful of their planning time,\" Harkowa said. Another focus is helping students develop English proficiency in elementary school.\nSupervisor of Special Education Erica McDonald discussed the objective of closing the achievement gap for students with disabilities.\nThe leadership team created a mission statement at the beginning of the current school year, provided Goalbook toolkit training and additional training to help teachers and co-teachers meet objectives and monitor \"disproportionate identification and disciplinary practices.\"\n\"Our special education teacher specialists have really taken on the role of educational diagnosticians,\" she said.\nA Blueprint objective is to \"establish or enhance Community Schools in areas of concentrated poverty.\" Three CCPS schools \u2014 Federalsbury Elementary, Greensboro Elementary and Colonel Richardson Middle School \u2014 meet the criteria and have district coordinators assigned to them.\nSupervisor of Student Services Nicole Fisher reported the Pillar 4 team is committed to evidence-based practices, but challenges facing the district are providing adequate behavioral health staffing and transportation.\nSimmons said \"As Blueprint ratchets up, all nine of our schools are going to qualify for Concentration of Poverty funding due to the FARMS (Free and Reduced-Price Meals) rates in all of our schools \u2026 in about another two or three years.\"\nPillar 5: Governance and Accountability\n\"Pillar 5 is what pulls together all of the other pillars,\" Simmons said, explaining that the pillar focuses on governance and accountability.\nTwo main areas of focus are the \"stakeholder engagement plan\" and Blueprint funding and resources which require \"money following the students.\"\n\"Pillars 1 through 4 have done an incredible job of reaching out to community members, and they've got strong, robust teams that are getting lots of feedback,\" Simmons said, elaborating on the stakeholder engagement objective.\n\"There are shifts \u2014 monumental shifts in some areas \u2014 for the way that we're doing (Blueprint),\" he said. \"But eventually we'll stop talking about Blueprint, and we'll just be talking about what it is that we're doing that connects to the strategic plan, because the overlap will be there when it's closer to full implementation.\"\nThe complete report is linked in the Jan. 9 meeting agenda, where you can also watch the complete school board meeting at carolineschools.new.swagit.com/videos/294177\nThe MSDE Blueprint Implementation Plan is available at bit.ly/BlueprintPlanMSDE. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Moore says budget will balance, protect school funding\n\n January 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KIERSTEN HACKER Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 930\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Gov. Wes Moore unveiled a budget proposal on Wednesday that would balance the books and protect the state's ambitious reform plan for Maryland public schools, without raising taxes in the fiscal year that begins in July.The $63.1 billion plan would balance the books where officials had projected a shortfall, in part by returning some programs to spending levels closer to those of the pre-pandemic era. The plan proposes leveraging state debt and dipping into rainy day funds.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's sweeping education plan of 2021, will be fully funded, state budget officials said Wednesday. Moore, a Democrat, said his administration crafted the budget plan in partnership with lawmakers, community leaders and other \"village elders.\"\n\"We wanted to make sure that this proposed budget had everyone's fingerprints on it,\" Moore said in his public announcement of the new plan. \"Because this budget is not just a reflection of an administration. This budget is a reflection of our shared aspiration.\"\nThose aspirations will now go to the Maryland General Assembly for debate. Lawmakers have set a target of early April for passing a budget, and the state Constitution requires that it be balanced.\nBut the joint Republican Caucus will look closely at where funding transfers in the proposed budget are coming from, House Minority Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany, told Capital News Service.\nWhile he said he is pleased that the Moore administration kept total spending similar to that of years past, he expressed concerns about the possibility of fees for certain businesses or tax hikes down the road. Buckel said he'll keep worrying about that possibility until the legislature adjourns.\n\"All in all, it's a mixed bag, I think, and we'll look forward to working with the governor and working with the Democratic leadership here to try to make the budget as good as possible,\" Buckel said.\nSenate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey suggested he worries about the possibility of fee increases down the road.\n\"While it is a relief that the governor's budget spends less than last year and does not raise taxes, the number of fee increases proposed by his administration through legislation and the regulatory process is concerning,\" said Hershey, a Republican representing Kent, Cecil, Queen Anne's and Caroline, in an email release. He and other Republicans contend fee hikes are coming through the administrative pipeline.\n\"Taxes aren't the only way to raise revenue,\" Hershey said, \"and state government should not be in the business of nickel and diming Maryland's families and small businesses.\"\nThe only fee increases currently in the budget plan are in the Department of the Environment, and those would generate roughly $3.5 million in revenue, according to a spokesman for the governor's office.\nWorking together to approve a balanced budget had been shaping up as no easy task. The state's spending had been projected to outpace revenues starting in the coming fiscal year, according to a recent report from the Department of Legislative Services.\nBut Moore has now proposed a plan that would instead balance the 2025 budget, saying it is a step in the right direction toward addressing the state's structural deficit in the years beyond that.\nHis budget flips the expected cash shortfall of $1.1 billion to a positive cash balance of $103 million in fiscal 2025, according to Helene Grady, Maryland's secretary of budget and management.\nMoore said his budget prioritizes public safety, affordable housing, child care, education and public service. It also raises pay for state employees.\n\"We know that budgets, they're moral documents,\" Moore said. \"Where we choose to invest actually defines our values. And it dictates the course of our future.\"\nState budget officials said they avoided wide-ranging cuts across the board, hiring freezes or salary freezes. Rather, state agency heads went through an intense process and found areas to trim, and several agency budgets will be lower this year than they were the year before.\nMoore said he proposed a record $127 million for local police agencies, citing the importance of supporting law enforcement and getting \"more boots on the ground\" to solve crimes and keep repeat offenders off the streets. Other investments would go toward the prevention of gun violence and support for crime victims.\nWhile addressing public safety, Moore acknowledged the debates about juvenile justice likely to come during the legislative session, announcing an increase in funding to the Department of Juvenile Services. He didn't specifically discuss any cuts made to juvenile services programs.\nAffordable housing and child care would receive significant funding under the proposal. Those are two areas Moore claimed are the biggest strains on Maryland residents. Access to housing and child care allow for increased participation in the workforce as Maryland tries to grow its economy, he argued.\n\"Access to child care doesn't just affect your child and your family,\" Moore said. \"It changes the trajectory of our state's fiscal health.\"\nOptions for job training in innovative industries and public service were a priority. Through Moore's budget, the state is on track to increase the number of Service Year Option and Maryland Corps participants to 500, as required by law.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future will be fully funded in the coming fiscal year, budget officials said, but its money problems are far from resolved. Prior to the beginning of the legislative session, the Department of Legislative Services report projected the state would exhaust the Blueprint balance in fiscal 2027.\n\"It's not inaccurate to say, 'Hey, we funded the Blueprint, or at least the state's portion of the Blueprint, for today,'\" Buckel said. \"But I also think it's completely honest to say the blueprint looming large over the next four or five years, blows billion-dollar holes into our state budget.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So, we are approaching a high, which is where we want to be.\"\nCommissioner Frank Bartz asked about maintaining support services salaries, something that he said is not addressed in the Blueprint.\n\"A lot of people in the county work for support services,\" he said. \"I just want to make sure that they're taken care of.\"\n\"You're spot on,\" Simmons said. \"The Blueprint addresses teachers only and leaves out two-thirds of our workgroup, and (it) does not take into consideration any support staff or administration. Required increases to salaries are \u2026 for the most part, to classroom-based teachers with kids on the workload.\"\nSimmons said the Supportive Services Association is a negotiated employee group.\n\"Their contract was ratified to be closed from 2012 until next year, so that has been a closed contract with a required 1% in step every year, and then it's 1% in addition to whatever the teachers get. Their contract comes open next year for us to negotiate.\"\nSimmons said the \"biggest challenge that we're going to see this year\" is the Blueprint formula's increase of 1.7% over last year's budget \"when inflation is currently still running over 3%, and that factors in no increases in health insurance, which is probably 5% to 7% right now, we're hearing.\"\nThat percentage does not factor in any pay increase. Blueprint requires first-year classroom teachers to be earning $60,000 by fiscal year 2027.\n\"After this year, the budget increases roughly 5%,\" Simmons said. \"We're sitting in a different position in our county than some of our colleagues are in others. \u2026 A lot of the larger systems are looking at significant cuts of teaching positions because (of) that 1.7% increase. It's a regressive budget no matter how you cut it, when it's only that much of an increase, and the cost of living is definitely a lot higher.\"\nWhen COVID funding and (Maryland) Leads funding \"dries up in September at the same time as we're getting a 1.7% increase, that's the perfect storm,\" Simmons said. \"And again, we'll weather it for our staff. We'll figure it out. I really, truly believe we will. It's just going to be a really tough year.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Proimos spent her final semesters at school creating a web-based graphic novel about traveling in the footsteps of Frederick Douglass.This novel, aimed at young adults, is a playful and curious take on a serious subject. The author wrote it in conjunction with her thesis while completing her bachelor's degree in English.\nIn it, there are mixed photographs, fine art, cartoons and mixed media together.\nAfter receiving a $3,000 Sophie Kerr Promise Grant, Proimos and her dog, Zelda, traveled from Easton's farm fields, to the city of Baltimore, to Douglass' gravesite in Rochester, New York. It was travel in search of the famed abolitionist's life story.\n\"This book follows his actual narrative from when Douglass was born to when he escaped to freedom. This tells his biographical story,\" Promios said about her graphic novel, which she wrote with information gleaned from her travels.\nShe marvels at his place in history and her own.\n\"I wonder how many spots Zelda and I stood exactly where Douglass had stood. Each place we went uncovered new information and new stories about Douglass and the early formation of American history. We were able to immerse ourselves in the scenery and make new discoveries through museums, national forest exhibits, books, murals and all kinds of unexpected representations.\"\nThe writer said that she moved to Easton while completing her studies and found herself living right next to history.\n\"When I moved to Easton, they were having a huge debate about a Confederate monument that was still outside of the courthouse. As the community was having this debate, a mural was painted by Michael Rosato. His was the first mural to go up. As I was finishing my thesis statement, Adam Himhoff's mural went up. I was kind of living in the middle of Douglass history that was still going on,\" she said.\nShe said she wrote her thesis on the multi-dimensional nature of Douglas. The book \"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass\" strikes her as more than just a book and was the spine of her paper.\n\"I explored a lot of representations, like statues and graphic representations, because that was important to his image as he was the most photographed man of the 19th century. He was way ahead of his time. He was like the American dream of the underdog,\" she said.\nThe graphic novel contains lots of photographs of primary historical sites and whimsical drawings by Proimos.\n\"I can read the graphic novel with my 9-year-old. She is not going to get everything. It is meant to go with the 'Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass.' But there are cartoony elements in there that are fun and light hearted. It shows you that Frederick Douglass is a relatable person,\" she said.\nTo read her graphic novel, go to: frederickdouglasseaston.blogspot.com \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore's proposed fiscal year 2025 budget calls for the reduction of $22 million in Cade formula funding to community colleges in the state.\nThe Cade formula essentially ties state funding for community colleges to state funding for designated University System of Maryland institutions, according to the Maryland Association of Community Colleges.\nMoore's proposal would reduce the Cade formula from 29% to 26.5%.\nThat percentage \u2014 the amount of funding community colleges receive from the state \u2014 is based on the funding given to public four-year institutions per full-time equivalent student.\nAt the Eastern Shore Delegation meeting, legislators were joined by the presidents of colleges that are located on the Eastern Shore, as well as MACC Executive Director Brad Phillips.\nPhillips called rebasing the Cade formula a \"budget word\" for inequity.\n\"Look at it this way,\" he said. \"If you're giving a student a dollar to go to a University System of Maryland or a four-year public institution, the policy goal is that 29 cents goes to community colleges. ... (with the reduction,) you're cutting community colleges out. You're still providing a dollar to our four-year friends.\"\nWor-Wic Community College President Deborah Casey told the delegation she had spent hours preparing a budget with an 11% cut.\n\"That's $1.5 million for Wor-Wic Community College,\" she said of the budget cut. \"That doesn't work for us.\"\nCasey said that she can't build infrastructure and carry Wor-Wic in the best direction with a budget reduction of this magnitude.\n\"And you're expecting and asking us, and holding us accountable to making sure we're meeting many needs of this community,\" she said. \"Please help us get that full funding.\"\nPhillips said Maryland's community colleges are up 8.3% in enrollment this year.\n\"So this is a cut that would actually stretch less funding to more students,\" he said.\nDuring the meeting, both Casey and Chesapeake College President Cliff Coppersmith mentioned increases in enrollment at their schools.\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) said this increased enrollment is one reason why this formula change is concerning.\nDel. Jefferson Ghrist (R-36, Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline), who made the motion to send the letter, said the Maryland Department of Legislative Services had given the House Appropriations Committee, which he is a member of, a list of possible cuts that could be made in order to restore the Cade formula to 29%.\n\"There's a lot of places that we can go to find money to restore that,\" he said.\nGhrist said getting the Cade formula restored in a supplemental budget, however, would make the job of the House Appropriations Committee easier.\n\"That way it'll be done before we start really getting down to work on the budget,\" he said. \"That would make our jobs a heck of a lot easier on the committee.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's about trying to find a plan that allows that school to continue.\"\nThe situation became sticky last week when a letter about the closing of the school was prematurely sent to the school, which is in the same complex of buildings where the commissioners meet weekly.\n\"That was our mistake,\" Commissioner President Randy Guy said.\nThe school was paying county government $12,000 a year in rent.\nThe commissioners voted Tuesday to end the lease, but Commissioner Eric Colvin was against closing the school.\n\"I've heard the incredible impact the school has had in helping students turn their lives around,\" he said. \"My opposition in ending this lease is that I did not feel as if there were enough alternatives evaluated. I felt that we could have worked with the school a little bit more to try and find a solution and I'm still opposed to it.\"\nA handful of supporters of the school, including alumni, attended the meeting, though no one spoke to the commissioners. When asked, the group said Headmistress Sarah Green was not in attendance.\nOlivia Flynn, one of the supporters, said on Tuesday the school had positively impacted her.\nHer first year at the school she received 52 infractions in one quarter \u2014 three are enough to warrant discipline \u2014 but that number dwindled rapidly over the next few years and she said graduated as a top student leader in 2018.\n\"It's a process and its a fellowship with the teachers and a mentorship built with the administrators,\" Flynn said in an interview with Southern Maryland News after Tuesday's meeting. \"It helped me deal with conflict, it also helped me build good relationships with people and helped me prepare for life.\"\nFlynn returned to the school which served grades 6 through 12, in 2022 as a history, English and algebra teacher.\nCounty Attorney Buffy Giddens went over a timeline of events, beginning with the school being given a fresh 10-year lease in 2013.\nOn Feb. 28, 2023, the county received an email request from Green to renew the lease as well as fix the AC unit, which was estimated to be about $100,000.\nIn May, an assessment looked at 27 systems, which discovered a host of needed repairs and maintenance.

It's about trying to find a plan that allows that school to continue.\"\nThe situation became sticky last week when a letter about the closing of the school was prematurely sent to the school, which is in the same complex of buildings where the commissioners meet weekly.\n\"That was our mistake,\" Commissioner President Randy Guy said.\nThe school was paying county government $12,000 a year in rent.\nThe commissioners voted Tuesday to end the lease, but Commissioner Eric Colvin was against closing the school.\n\"I've heard the incredible impact the school has had in helping students turn their lives around,\" he said. \"My opposition in ending this lease is that I did not feel as if there were enough alternatives evaluated. I felt that we could have worked with the school a little bit more to try and find a solution and I'm still opposed to it.\"\nA handful of supporters of the school, including alumni, attended the meeting, though no one spoke to the commissioners. When asked, the group said Headmistress Sarah Green was not in attendance.\nOlivia Flynn, one of the supporters, said on Tuesday the school had positively impacted her.\nHer first year at the school she received 52 infractions in one quarter \u2014 three are enough to warrant discipline \u2014 but that number dwindled rapidly over the next few years and she said graduated as a top student leader in 2018.\n\"It's a process and its a fellowship with the teachers and a mentorship built with the administrators,\" Flynn said in an interview with Southern Maryland News after Tuesday's meeting. \"It helped me deal with conflict, it also helped me build good relationships with people and helped me prepare for life.\"\nFlynn returned to the school which served grades 6 through 12, in 2022 as a history, English and algebra teacher.\nCounty Attorney Buffy Giddens went over a timeline of events, beginning with the school being given a fresh 10-year lease in 2013.\nOn Feb. 28, 2023, the county received an email request from Green to renew the lease as well as fix the AC unit, which was estimated to be about $100,000.\nIn May, an assessment looked at 27 systems, which discovered a host of needed repairs and maintenance. The estimate was $575,000 with the school on the hook for about $250,000.\nFlynn said \"no one else in the school was informed\" of the needed upgrades, despite the school's extensive alumni and parent network.\nThree months later, the commissioners advised Green of the maintenance issues identified in the facilities assessment and requested a financial sustainability plan by the end of 2023.\n\"We wanted to give them a chance to rectify the situation,\" Hewitt said. \"We told them, 'We need to hear from you, we need to hear your plan,' but we didn't hear anything for a couple of months.\"\nGreen was unable to be reached for comment this week by Southern Maryland News.\nHewitt said the school retained an attorney in October.\n\"My first thought was, 'Why are you wasting money on an attorney?

If I was a kid, this place would be like a playground to me \u2014 all the water you wanted, and access to do all kinds of fun things on the water, and all this rural, beautiful countryside. But I didn't see any kids,\" said Stanley.\nShe found a group of kids sitting on the steps of the Community Center. Parks and Recreation had the kids playing board games under the porch. She came back to find them in the afternoon, but they were all gone. They had left out of boredom.\n\"Oxford has fewer families with children living in it (now). The original camp really did serve the community. Families living here, grandparents and children of people who worked here. We had plenty of children then. We have had to open to a larger community. It changes the dynamics a lot. There was that spirit that you got there on your own and got home on your own,\" she said.\nThe camp served 50 kids a week and grew to 250 for the summer. Biking and nature gave way to swimming lessons and canoeing.\n\"That was the idea. Let's do a summer program. We approached the Community Center, who was beginning. I approached them and they said, 'We would love you to use the Community Center, but you have to be independent of us,' which was a good decision on their part. It forced us to think about what kind of an organization we wanted to be,\" Stanley said.\nStanley, who had previously run education programs with kids at the South Street Seaport in New York City, worked at American Youth Hostels leading bike trips. She had traveled abroad with kids in Canada, Europe and South America.\nOxford Kids Camp came to life in 1982. It has a board and is a nonprofit organization.\n\"The community really embraced us. Here we were riding around town and people were cautious. If it was a through, it would be different, but we are a dead end, a peninsula. It was ideal,\" she said.\nElizabeth Wainright, who taught at New York's prestigious grade school for boys, Buckley, has been part of the camp since she was a girl.\nWainright has been named as Stanley's replacement at the kids camp.\n\"Elizabeth was a camper at age five. I can still visualize her. She laughed so hard at the bad boys. She was also a trickster. At one of our campouts, we woke up to toilet paper all over. If I can dream about the perfect person, she would be it. She will keep me in the loop. We haven't figured that out yet, but I am thrilled to be turning over the reins,\" Stanley said.\nWainright said, \"Both OKC (Oxford Kids Camp) and Miss Jenny had given me experiences as a camper, counselor and co-director that have been among my favorite and most formative. It is hard to imagine camp without Jenny at the helm. She will still be involved significantly, but I am honored to take the tiller for the next leg of the course.\"\nLooking back at what really worked, Stanley said, \"The biking was really popular. It was freedom, and even through you are in a line, you are going places that they don't usually get to go to. They love it. There is a lot of laughs and silliness in camp. They knew they were welcome. They could be free and they were free to play hard.\"\nFor more information about Oxford Kids Camp, visit oxfordkidscamp.org/. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Sense of urgency needed on school absenteeism\n\n February 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 634\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Representatives from the Maryland State Department of Education, Maryland Association of Boards of Education and Public School Superintendents' Association of Maryland met recently with members of the Ways and Means Committee in the Maryland House of Delegates.At that meeting, all three advocacy groups expressed their support for fully funding the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, also known as the Kirwan Report.\nAlong with the Blueprint for Maryland's Future there is another issue that has had and will have a significant impact on public education in Maryland.\nThat issue is chronic absenteeism.\nThe Maryland Department of Education defines chronic absenteeism as missing more than 20 days in a school year, no matter the reason.\nWYPR, the public broadcasting corporation's flagship radio station in Baltimore, recently introduced a news report on this issue with the following lead in:\n\"Chronic absenteeism 'real concern' Maryland lawmakers and educators aim to address.\"\nWYPR cited Maryland Board of Education data indicating that over one-third of Maryland K-12 students missed 10% or more school days last year, with 54.1% of Baltimore City students and 34.7% of Baltimore County students hitting that mark.\nThe consequences of chronic absenteeism are serious and long lasting.\nMaryland Board of Education President Clarence Crawford has observed that \"chronic absenteeism can adversely impact a child for a lifetime.\" He noted research has shown that \"chronic absenteeism impacts test scores, grades and children's ability to be able to graduate.\" He also noted \"chronic absenteeism increases the likelihood of engagement with the criminal justice system.\"\nEspecially disheartening in the Maryland Board of Education data that nearly 35% of children in kindergarten statewide are chronically absent.\nSue Fothergill, a senior fellow at Attendance Works (a national nonprofit dedicated to raising awareness about the negative impacts of absenteeism), says: \"In early grades, some of our families think, 'Well, it's just kindergarten, or it's just first grade, children can miss a few days here and there, it's not that big of a deal.' The reality though, is that those are the most important formative years, not just for learning to read, but learning social emotional skills and establishing habits that help those young people throughout their careers. When a child is chronically absent in kindergarten, they are less likely to be proficient in reading by third grade as at that point, teachers often switch to content-focused learning. It becomes much harder to catch a child up and be able to learn how to read as they matriculate through their years, because they've missed those formative years.\"\nGov. Wes Moore and state lawmakers are aware of and have already demonstrated a level of concern and action on this problem.\nAt a recent \"Improving Student Achievement\" event in Washington, D.C., Moore said, \"We know that there are real obstacles we still have to address.\"\nIn the Statehouse and the state Senate, legislation has been introduced to establish a task force to study chronic absenteeism in Maryland's public schools.\nThe legislation as introduced, requires the task force to report its findings and recommendations to the governor and General Assembly by Dec. 1.\nGoing forward, local and state funding levels for the Blueprint for Maryland's Future will continue to generate enormous amounts of dialogue and deliberation at local governments throughout Maryland and in the General Assembly. That is to be expected as the Blueprint is a multi-year initiative that mandates a projected $3.8 billion increase above current levels of local and state funding for public education in Maryland.\nA critical element of success in public education requires more than mandated increases of local and state funding.\nIt requires more than awareness of, concern about, and discussions on the issue of chronic absenteeism.\nWhat is needed is a sense of urgency on action to address chronic absenteeism in every public school in Maryland.\nDavid Reel is a consultant who provides counsel and services on strategy, advocacy and media on public affairs issues. He lives in Easton. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "House GOP introduces bill to repeal Biden college plan\n\n February 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MATHEW SCHUMER Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 549\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON \u2014 The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has advanced a Republican-sponsored bill that includes measures repealing key aspects of the Biden administration's plans to make college more affordable.The College Cost Reduction Act, introduced by the panel's chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-North Carolina), passed on a party-line 22-19 vote.\nThe measure presents numerous programs intended to strengthen the integrity of higher education institutions across the country, but also would gut much of President Joe Biden's efforts to help students afford college. Democrats on the committee offered a series of amendments to the bill aimed at blocking the GOP repeals, but all were defeated.\n\"Unfortunately, President Biden has decided time and time again that the executive branch should also hold the legislative pen,\" Foxx said, \"Congress has the task of creating laws that reflect the interests of the people. It is not the role of the executive pen.\"\nLast August, the Biden administration launched the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) program, aiming to cancel debt to borrowers who originally owed $12,000 or less in loans and had repaid at least ten years of those loans.\nThe program is slated to begin in February, with 6.9 million Americans already enrolled, according to the White House.\nBiden's original plan, as laid out in his 2022 executive order to cancel up to $430 billion in student loans, was blocked by the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision last June. The court determined that the secretary of education lacked the power to issue debt relief on the scale described in the administration's plan.\nLast September, Foxx introduced a resolution with Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Michigan, to nullify the SAVE plan, but the full House never voted on it.\nFoxx's College Cost Reduction Act, introduced in January, would establish a streamlined data system to convey information about colleges, create a performance-based grant program, and hold academic institutions responsible for unpaid student loans.\nIn the committee meeting to consider the bill, Democrats introduced 30 amendments to alter some fundamental aspects of the legislation.\nRep. Bobby Scott (D-Virginia) praised parts of Foxx's bill, \"such as codifying Postsecondary Student Success Grants and eliminating interest capitalization and origination fees on student loans,\" but the panel's ranking Democrat objected to some provisions that he said would make it harder for people to go to college.\nRep. Kathy Manning (D-Michigan) offered an amendment to strike language from the bill repealing Biden administration regulations to protect student borrowers during changes in ownership of academic institutions.\nAnother Biden administration regulation the Foxx bill aims to repeal is the 90-10 rule, which requires for-profit universities to secure at least 10 percent of their funding from non-federal sources. Rep. Mark Takano (D-California) introduced an amendment to strike this section from the final bill but was rebuffed by the GOP majority.\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) offered a motion to remove the bill's rescission of Biden's SAVE plan, but that motion was defeated.\n\"The new (SAVE) program created by the Biden administration\u2026 creates a generous IDR (income-driven repayment) plan that Republicans now want to strip away,\" Omar said.\nRep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Michigan) unsuccessfully tried to amend the bill with language streamlining the process of finding on-campus accommodations for students with disabilities.\nBonamici's proposal is part of a group of bills unveiled Monday by Democratic members of the education panel referred to collectively as the Roadmap to College Student Success. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What are you doing buddy? What's up pal?\" Jeff Simmons welcomes everyone with his energetic and contagious excitement.\nIt's 7:30 a.m. on a Tuesday morning. School won't begin for more than an hour. What brings middle schoolers, teachers and community members out early before school?\nFor some students in Queen Anne and Talbot Counties, it's a new club called Fellowship of Christian Athletes. This club, or huddle, welcomes not only athletes but anyone who wants to come and make a difference.\nAlthough FCA may be new to some local schools, it is well-known around the world. For over 60 years, FCA has had one mission \u2014 \"unite your two passions, faith and athletics, to impact the world for Jesus Christ.\"\nFounder Don McClanen started FCA after reading that 30 million American youth had no religious training. McClanen began posting his articles in the locker room and praying before games. Soon, he was dreaming of a way for well-known Christian athletes to advertise their faith on television and in magazines the way they advertised other household products. Currently, FCA is in 115 countries with over 20,000 huddle meetings occurring around the world.\nAt their first huddle, Centreville Middle students spent time together in fellowship.\nThe \"Walk Out Faith'' huddle activity included scripture readings, a memory verse and relevant questions asking teens how they can grow their faith while also building the community around them.\nSeventh Grade Social Studies teacher Thomas Hayman helps oversee the FCA huddle with other school staff. A former church youth director and a current Queen Anne's County Public Schools Teacher of the Year finalist, Hayman is dedicated to teaching and investing in his students. His loyalty doesn't go unnoticed, Hayman's students said he's told them he would even \"take a bullet\" to keep them safe.\nHayman said it was fate that allowed him to meet Simmons, a former CMS tutor, at the school and fate that put him in this position. Hayman said he is looking forward to the fellowship afforded by FCA \"to get together, have fun and see what kind of positive change we can make.\"\nSimmons is the area director of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes) for Queen Anne's and Talbot counties.\nHe said he had not heard of FCA until a friend suggested he look into it. After research and attending some huddle meetings, he said he was \"blown away by what they were doing, how they were doing it, and the impact it had.\nIn his new position, Simmons has to annually raise his entire budget. The success here is directly linked to the local community's involvement, Simmons said.\nWith all the huddles happening, there were still many middle and high schools in both Queen Anne's and Talbot counties that had no FCA presence and did not have the same opportunities.\nIn this monthly email update, Simmons wrote, \"There are 9 schools (middle and high) between both counties that do not have any sort of FCA on their campuses.\"\nWith the generous support of the community, the 2024 FCA budget for Queen Anne's and Talbot counties was fully funded.\n\"Thanks to God's provision, coming in the form of generous one time donations and support from those who signed on as Monthly Partners, we reached the amount needed to support the program's budget for 2024\" Simmons said.\n\"In order to establish FCA programming in the remaining schools, we need to fully fund our FCA budget with recurring donations,\" Simmons shared. \"Securing our annual budget with recurring monthly support will allow us to start planning for the future of FCA on the Eastern Shore. This will allow us to not only provide resources and support to the huddles that are already up and running, but also to establish a FCA presence in the schools without one currently.\"\n\"Your support, whether it be in financial contributions, prayer and encouragement,\" Simmons continued, \"has confirmed this community's commitment to see Jesus glorified and lives changed through this ministry, and I am so grateful that we all get to be a part of it. God is working on the Shore through these coaches, students, and leaders and I know that the best is yet to come!\"\nIf you would like more information or would like to volunteer, email Jeff Simmons at jsimmons@fca.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This is a nearly $7.9 million increase from fiscal year 2024.\nTCPS Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said that while this seems like a larger increase than recent years, the increase is meant to offset a decrease in federal funding.\n\"This unrestricted budget coupled with the decrease in all of our federal programs nets to a 3.4% increase,\" she said.\nThis means that the district is asking for a total of 3.4% more money than it received for fiscal year 2024.\nTCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the district is losing $4.8 million in grant funding for fiscal year 2025.\nTCPS Director of Communications Debbie Gardner said in an interview that the $4.8 million came from two COVID-19 related grants \u2014 the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund and the Maryland Leads grant.\nThe proposed capital budget for fiscal year 2025 is $12.1 million. Capital requests include the renovation and expansion of Chapel District Elementary School, the installation of a turf field at Easton High School, the replacement of auditorium lights at Easton High School, the installation of a basketball court at Easton Elementary School, an update to the stadium lighting at Easton High School and a playground replacement at St. Michaels Elementary School.\nNext month, the proposed budget will be presented to the County Council.

Einhorn said this includes discussing any challenges the district might be facing with implementation.\nThis report is a way for the state to monitor that school districts are \"able to transform\" through reshaping and adapting new polices and practices that create a more equitable system, Einhorn said.\n\"I'm here tonight to assure you that we will meet that March 15 deadline,\" she said. \"And I look forward to sharing some of the findings in that report.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Corporate Tax Breaks End Up Costing Schools",
    "date": "2024-02-16",
    "author": "THE CONVERSATION",
    "content": "Corporate tax breaks end up costing schools\n\n February 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: THE CONVERSATION | Section: National \n \n 1063\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Built in 1910, James Elementary is a three-story brick school in Kansas City, Missouri's historic Northeast neighborhood, with a bright blue front door framed by a sand-colored stone arch adorned with a gargoyle.As bustling students and teachers negotiate a maze of gray stairs with worn wooden handrails, Marjorie Mayes, the school's principal, escorts a visitor across uneven blue tile floors on the ground floor to a classroom with exposed brick walls and pipes. Bubbling paint mars some walls, evidence of the water leaks spreading inside the aging building.\n\"It's living history,\" said Mayes during a mid-September tour of the building. \"Not the kind of living history we want.\"\nThe district would like to tackle the $400 million in deferred maintenance needed to create a 21st century learning environment at its 35 schools \u2014 including James Elementary \u2014 but it can't. It doesn't have the money.\nPROPERTY TAX REDIRECT\nThe lack of funds is a direct result of the property tax breaks that Kansas City lavishes on companies and developers that do business there. The program is supposed to bring in new jobs and business but instead has ended up draining civic coffers and starving schools. Between 2017 and 2023, the Kansas City school district lost $237.3 million through tax abatements.\nKansas City is hardly an anomaly. An estimated 95% of U.S. cities provide economic development tax incentives to woo corporate investors. The upshot is that billions have been diverted from large urban school districts and from a growing number of small suburban and rural districts. The impact is seen in districts as diverse as Chicago and Cleveland, Hillsboro, Oregon, and Storey County, Nevada.\nThe result? A 2021 review of 2,498 financial statements from school districts across 27 states revealed that, in 2019 alone, at least $2.4 billion was diverted to fund tax incentives. Yet that substantial figure still downplays the magnitude of the problem, because three-quarters of the 10,370 districts analyzed did not provide any information on tax abatement agreements.\nTax abatement programs have long been controversial, pitting states and communities against one another in beggar-thy-neighbor contests. Their economic value is also, at best, unclear: Studies show most companies would have made the same location decision without taxpayer subsidies. Meanwhile, schools make up the largest cost item in these communities, meaning they suffer most when companies are granted breaks in property taxes.\nA three-month investigation by The Conversation and three scholars with expertise in economic development, tax laws and education policy shows that the cash drain from these programs is not equally shared by schools in the same communities. At the local level, tax abatements and exemptions often come at the cost of critical funding for school districts that students from low-income households and who are racial minorities.\nIn Missouri, for example, in 2022 nearly $1,700 per student was redirected from Kansas City public and charter schools, while between $500 and $900 was redirected from wealthier, whiter Northland schools on the north side of the river in Kansas City and in the suburbs beyond. Other studies have found similar demographic trends elsewhere, including New York state, South Carolina and Columbus, Ohio.\nThe funding gaps produced by abated money often force schools to delay needed maintenance, increase class sizes, lay off teachers and support staff and even close outright. Schools also struggle to update or replace outdated technology, books and other educational resources. And, amid a nationwide teacher shortage, schools under financial pressures sometimes turn to inexperienced teachers who are not fully certified or rely too heavily on recruits from overseas who have been given special visa status.\nLost funding also prevents teachers and staff, who often feed, clothe and otherwise go above and beyond to help students in need, from earning a living wage. All told, tax abatements can end up harming a community's value, with constant funding shortfalls creating a cycle of decline.\nINCENTIVES AND PAYOFFS\nPerversely, some of the largest beneficiaries of tax abatements are the politicians who publicly boast of handing out the breaks despite the harm to poorer communities. Incumbent governors have used the incentives as a means of taking credit for job creation, even when the jobs were coming anyway.\n\"We know that subsidies don't work,\" said Elizabeth Marcello, a doctoral lecturer at Hunter College who studies governmental planning and policy and the interactions between state and local governments. \"But they are good political stories, and I think that's why politicians love them so much.\"\nWhile some voters may celebrate abatements, parents can recognize the disparities between school districts that are created by the tax breaks. Fairleigh Jackson pointed out that her daughter's East Baton Rouge third grade class lacks access to playground equipment.\nThe class is attending school in a temporary building while their elementary school undergoes a two-year renovation.\nThe temporary site has some grass and a cement slab where kids can play, but no playground equipment, Jackson said. And parents needed to set up an Amazon wish list to purchase basic equipment such as balls, jump ropes and chalk for students to use. The district told parents there would be no playground equipment due to a lack of funds, then promised to install equipment, Jackson said, but months later, there is none.\nJackson said it's hard to complain when other schools in the district don't even have needed security measures in place. \"When I think about playground equipment, I think that's a necessary piece of child development,\" Jackson said. \"Do we even advocate for something that should be a daily part of our kids' experience when kids' safety isn't being funded?\"\nA young student in the East Baton Rouge district told the school board that money going to tax breaks for corporations could provide better internet access or be used to hire someone to pick up the glass and barbed wire in the playground. But at least they have a playground \u2014 Hayden Crockett, a seventh grader at Sherwood Middle Academic Magnet School, noted that his sister's elementary school lacked one.\n\"If it wasn't in the budget to fund playground equipment, how can it also be in the budget to give one of the most powerful corporations in the world a tax break?\" Crockett said. \"The math just ain't mathing.\"\nThis article was written by Christine Wen, Texas A&M University; Danielle McLean, The Conversation; Kevin Welner, University of Colorado Boulder; and Nathan Jensen, The University of Texas at Austin.

I think that's important,\" said Shira Goodman, senior director of advocacy for the Anti-Defamation League, which has seen a rise in reports of antisemitism since Oct. 7.\nGoodman said protests and events on campus can potentially run afoul of Title VI of the federal Civil Rights Act that protects students and others of \"shared ancestry\" and other protected classes from mistreatment and harassment at colleges and universities receiving federal financial aid and other government money.\nThe U.S. Department of Education is currently conducting Title VI shared ancestry investigations at more than 40 colleges \u2014 including Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, University of Michigan, Montana State University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of South Florida and University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nOn the other side of the issue, Haley Gluhanich, program officer for campus rights advocacy for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, has seen an increase in calls from students and others across the political spectrum about their First Amendment rights being restricted.\n\"We are seeing events being canceled. We are seeing student organizations being de-chartered. We are seeing students and faculty members getting disciplined for social media posts for some comments made in class,\" Gluhanich said.\nProtests against the war include criticism of U.S. and President Joe Biden's military and other support for Israel.\nGluhanich and Jane Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota, said even \"hate speech\" enjoys First Amendment and protections as long as it doesn't cross the line into more direct and specific threats or incites violence.\nKirtley worries about government actors (including at public universities) as well as wealthy donors discouraging speech they don't like.\nShe said that comes with peril and potential blowback.\n\"Once we open the door to allowing the government to tell us what thoughts aren't acceptable, we run the risk that, in the future, ideas with which we agree could be suppressed, as well,\" she said.\nFor a more expansive story on this issue check out StarDem.com and our e-edition on Monday, Feb. 26. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Winter break will begin Dec. 20.\nThe calendar committee emailed a link to the survey Jan. 12 to over 5,400 parents, guardians and all CCPS staff members. A reminder email was sent Jan. 22, and the survey was closed Jan. 26. Some community members provided feedback, as well.\nAlthough 75% of the 3,500 parents and guardians who responded favored a post-Labor Day start, 696 staff respondents, or 70% preferred a pre-Labor Day start.\nBefore reviewing the feedback, Simmons cautioned the school board, saying, \"No matter what decision you make, you're going to make people upset, period. There is no perfect calendar, period.\"\nBoard member and retired Caroline County teacher Donna DiGiacomo favored the earlier start.\n\"So, one calendar starts Aug 28; the other starts Sept. 3, but the end date is just one day difference,\" DiGiacomo said. The adopted calendar gets \"students in a routine quicker, and you have a shorter week when you start \u2014 you have three days, so everybody's not dead by Friday.\"\nShe said a 4-day first day of school \"doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a lot.\"\nWinter break begins with a half-day Friday, Dec. 20, and students returning to school Jan. 7.\n\"A hard shutdown over winter break for two solid weeks\" would result in reduced heating costs and \"significant savings\" during \"the hardest budget year we're going to have,\" Simmons said.\nThe post-Labor Day calendar would have had students returning Thursday, Jan. 2, 2025.\n\"This might not be a popular thing to say, but the reality is not a whole lot is going to get done on that Thursday and Friday,\" DiGiacomo said.\nOther factors influencing the pre-Labor Day start were academic quarter dates and required parent-teacher conferences, which \"we talked about ad nauseum,\" Simmons said.\nCalling the process \"wonky\" and comparing it to a game of dominoes, Simmons explained the factors that prompted the calendar committee to go through \"seven or eight drafts to get down to the two that made the most sense.\"\nFor example, the first quarter parent-teacher conference day will occur Nov. 5, even though it's election day, because the first quarter ends Nov. 8 and the conference day \"has to fall before the first report card goes out, before grades are secured,\" Simmons said.\nThe adopted calendar has four inclement weather days built in. If they are not used, they come off the calendar.\nState law, teacher contracts, mandatory conferences, state testing days, a set number of half-days, a mid-year transition day all dictate certain days off. Once all of the days off are built in, \"it becomes a game of counting to 90 twice\" to achieve a state-mandated 180-day school year, Simmons said.\nDiGiacomo recommended surveying students next year and considering staggered starts for sixth grade and ninth grade students as they change schools.\n\"The pluses of draft two are just not as many as the pluses in draft one,\" said Rick Barton, president of the school board.\nAlthough he liked \"the idea of a longer break,\" school board Vice President Mark Jones was ambivalent.\n\"I honestly don't like either one of them, really,\" he said.\nThat ambivalence was reflected in the overall survey results, with 54% of all respondents preferring a post-Labor Day start and 46% going with the pre-Labor Day calendar.\nAnticipating mixed reactions from the public and staff as well, Jones asked, \"When do we want to hear complaints? Do we want to hear them right before the first day of school, or do we want to hear them after Christmas break? I think I'd probably rather hear them at the beginning of the year and get it out of the way.\"\nTo view the 2024-2025 CCPS school year calendar, visit www.carolineschools.org/page/ccps-school-calendar.

A week later, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, the Board announced that Bromwell would be stepping down from his position, effective March 1.\nBromwell was officially appointed as superintendent in 2020 with a four year term. Before that, he served as interim superintendent for the district. In his time at DCPS, he has also served as a teacher in the district and as the principal of Cambridge-South Dorchester High School.\nAccording to the Feb. 21 statement from the Board of Education, the decision for Bromwell to step down in March was \"mutually decided\" by him and the Board. In the Feb. 16 statement, the Board expressed gratitude to Bromwell for his years of service to DCPS.\nValerie Goff, DCPS communication and community outreach specialist, said Bromwell, who was not present at the Board meeting Thursday, had no comments at this time.\nAt the meeting, Board Vice President Susan Morgan acknowledged that the district is experiencing change \"once again.\"\n\"But I do trust in our teachers, our administrators, our directors and, now, our interim superintendent, to keep us moving forward,\" she said. \"Through everything we as a Board do, we always keep in the front of our minds what's best for all the children that we serve.\"\nBoard Member Chris Wheedleton said the search for the district's next leader can't happen without \"recognizing the value of somebody who has given close to 40 years of service to the district.\"\n\"I want to thank Mr. Bromwell for his service and for what he has done,\" Wheedleton said.\nEarlier in the meeting, Milton Nagel and Bill Middleton from the Maryland Association of Boards of Education presented on what to keep in mind when conducting a superintendent search.\nNagel told the Board that although it was not their reason for attending the meeting, MABE does conduct superintendent searches for its member districts.\n\"If the Board so desires to engage in that conversation about potentially having MABE do a search, we can certainly facilitate that,\" he said.\nIn a statement released later that night, the Board said it will begin the search for a new superintendent to take office July 1.\nToward the end of his remarks at the meeting Thursday, Thompson, who is also a board member of the Talbot County Board of Education, told the public that they will get mad at him.\n\"But I want you to also understand this \u2014 and I mean this from the bottom of my heart \u2014 that I'm always going to make the best decisions that I think are right for kids,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We are a family childcare home, not a center.\"\nThey opened just last summer. But over the years, Elizabeth has taught in a variety of childcare centers, in public and private schools, and at the university level.\n\"It was important to us to develop a program that included neurodivergent children and was based on best practice and research-informed play-based learning,\" she said. \"We recognized that the most impact on learning happens in early childhood and sought to develop a program that combined community resources, learning experiences outside the classroom, and sensory-rich play.\"\nA neuro-affirming, play-based, bilingual family child care located in Betterton, they are an MSDE-approved ASPIRE Pre-K and participate in the MD EXCELS and credentialing programs. With an extensive background in special education, their passion is providing quality care to diverse learners and serving families in their community.\nBeyond the home, Kinder Connection participates in many field trips for not just the children but for the whole family.\n\"Since we have been open, we have taken children to Tuckahoe State Park hiking, the Delaware Children's Museum, the Garfield theater twice, the Galena Fire Department, the Sultana Foundation twice, Bespoke Chocolate, Talbot County Ice Rink to go ice skating, to a magic show, to library concerts and events, and to almost every park in the area,\" Elizabeth said.\nFamilies pay a set field trip/holiday fee each week, and Kinder Connection coordinates everything. They also have had a variety of guest speakers come and talk to the children.\nIn less than a year, Kinder Connection is already making plans to expand.\n\"We are planning to expand our home by adding almost 600 square feet,\" Elizabeth said. \"This will allow us the already licensed Kinder Connection to convert to a designated Large Family Childcare and separate the two classrooms from their home. The facility is currently licensed for eight children, and the addition will allow them to serve 12 children. The next step is finding funding for the addition and a large van or small bus so that will make weekly field trips easier.\"\nWith a current waiting list for future spots, children are accepted through the ASPIRE program, which provides grant funding through MSDE for free tuition for qualifying families of children ages 3 to 5. Kinder Connection also accepts Child Care Scholarships for low-income working families.\n\"We strive to have our program look like our community \u2014 we value having a variety of cultures, races, abilities, and socio-economic status represented,\" Elizabeth said.\nIn addition to school-year care, Kinder Connection runs a summer camp as well. \"We run a 6-week summer camp where we enjoy immersing ourselves in art, music, and water play and take several field trips,\" she said.\nParents William Machande and Sarah Kalb said, \"Kinder Connection has been truly extraordinary for our son's growth and development. We are so fortunate to have found Ellie and Jamie. They provide a comfortable, fun and productive environment for the children. They go above and beyond, and then some.\"\n\"I love that my three year old learns beyond the four walls of a room and spends a lot of time outside, learning in exciting and innovative ways. He's always excited to share his day,\" said Robert and Dana Smith. \"Both Ellie and Jamie have included the families on fun field trips and in holiday fun. The Christmas program was such a highlight.\"\nFor more information, visit kinderconnection.org/. There is an upcoming open house for families of children ages 1 to 5 that are interested in fall care at 6 p.m. Monday, March 11. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Books rife with sexual content\n\n March 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 384\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When I first heard about the \"Freedom to Read\" Act, Maryland SB 0738, I was reminded of the words of one of our founders, John Adams : \"Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people, who have a right \u2026 and a desire to know; but besides this, they have a right, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge, I mean of the characters and conduct of their rulers.\" (A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law, 1765)So when I heard of the \"Freedom to Read\" Act, I wondered what banned books were suddenly going to be made available to the students of Maryland. I assumed there must be some politically controversial books from the Cold War Era that had been suppressed.\nIt was disappointing when I discovered that the books which Maryland students are being encouraged to read are rife with graphic sexual content, ones which most parents deem inappropriate for their children. Last fall, parents in Carroll County questioned why books with graphic sexual imagery were being made available to children without parental knowledge or consent.\nOne is the autobiography of Jaycee Dugard, who was kidnapped and used as a sex-slave in a cellar for years. I have read Dugard's \"A Stolen Life: A Memoir;\" it as a story of heroism but only for mature readers since it is about a kidnapping and child rape. It does not belong in a school.\nAn article in the Easton Gazette (Feb. 2, 2024) provides details about the \"banned\" books which SB 0738 is intended to liberate. To quote: \"These books have pornographic images or descriptions, the likes of which you could find in Penthouse magazine. The Carroll County Board considered the opinions of parents with children as young as elementary school who complained that these books demonstrating various types of sex such as oral, vaginal, anal, etc. were accessible to students. Some of the books portrayed graphic rape scenes or sexual experimentation in the story lines that were not appropriate for any minor child.\"\nSo when Maryland schools are struggling to achieve basic literacy, how is it helpful to have students' minds filled with images of rape, etc? Why are the wishes of parents ignored and disrespected? What is the agenda?\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nTalbot County Republican Central Committee\nClaiborne \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Peter and Paul High School.The team's project was a plan for a Salisbury Riverfront Community Center and included site logistics, design, cost estimates and timelines to pitch their vision for a center on the Wicomico River.\n\"The judges were blown away by the projects,\" Judge James Cook said. \"The industry is alive and well given what we have seen tonight.\"\nWhat the judges saw were project proposals by four teams. In addition to the Wicomico County team, Easton, Sts. Peter and Paul, and St. Michaels high schools competed for the gold cup and scholarships.\nThis was the 20th annual competition for ACE Mentors, a group of professionals representing the architecture, construction and engineering industries.\nEach team took the stage and pitched the case for their projects with slideshows.\nThe winning Wicomico project included landscape architecture and community art. The team presented the codes they would have to satisfy to create their building.\nAndrea Suk, Wicomico county coordinator, was thrilled with her students' win.\n\"We have 15 full time students,\" she said. \"These students are very interested in either architecture, construction or engineering.\"\nThe team worked with professional mentors in each of the ACE fields, mentors who volunteered their time to work with students.\n\"They give up their time to go into the schools and teach students about each of those fields and how they work together to create all the wonderful buildings and structures around us,\" Suk said.\nThe event was sponsored in part by the late Charles H. Thornton, a renowned structural engineer, educator and mentor who died in December. There were 26 other sponsors at different levels. The named scholarships were Easton Utilities, DBF/ACE Gerald Friedel Legacy, Lane Engineering, Griffith Family and CT Darnell Construction.\nThe platinum sponsors were the Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. and Willow Construction.\nThe St. Michaels High School project proposed a harbor floodgate to address global warming and the resulting flooding in town. The students proposed building a concrete wall with a 40-foot gate to let boats pass. The wall would go across the mouth of the harbor facing the Miles River.\nEaston High students proposed a tourist-friendly oyster hatchery called Project Clarity in Easton Point Park. Part of their plan was to bring oysters back to that part of Easton Point.\nThe last project, presented by the Sts. Peter and Paul team, proposed building a castle in Wye Mills near the intersection of U.S. Route 50 and state Route 404. The castle would host jousting and mixed martial arts programming. The colossal structure was estimated to cost more than $80 million to build.\n\"Our project is 'The Castle,'\" said Peter Anderson, a senior at Saints Peter and Paul. \"I really wanted to push the boundaries of ACE and break the mold and push the boundaries. I thought a castle would be big, bold and abrasive.\"\nThe presentations were reviewed by three judges \u2014 James Cook, vice president and project manager at Rauch; Aaron Goller, a civil engineer at Easton Utilities; and Rick VanEmburgh, engineer for the Town of Easton.\nLocal engineer Sean Callahan is the president of Lane Engineering and a mentor in the ACE program.\n\"ACE mentors does a tremendous job of bringing young folk up and showing them the ropes,\" Callahan said. \"It is great to see young folks get excited, and that is a part of what this is.\"\nAnother mentor working with students is Rebecca Saduk, a civil engineer for Easton Utilities.\n\"I wish I had had a program like ACE, and that is why I am so passionate about being a mentor,\" she said. \"These kids are learning real life work habits and how to work as a team.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "No One Knows How to Pay for Maryland's Massive Education Reform",
    "date": "2024-03-12",
    "author": "Capital News Service",
    "content": "No one knows how to pay for Maryland's massive education reform\n\n March 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1537\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Maryland's Democratic-led legislature passed the Blueprint for Maryland's Future in 2021, vowing to pour billions of dollars into the state's public schools to offer universal pre-K, improve teaching and make sure students are ready for college or careers.But the General Assembly didn't outline a long-term plan to fund the ambitious 10-year education reform effort \u2014 which increasingly looks like a blueprint for red ink.\nThe Local News Network at the University of Maryland found that the Blueprint is already devouring hundreds of millions annually from the state's fund balance, which is on target to be fully drained in 2027.\nAnd according to a state Department of Legislative Services fiscal briefing released in January, the state will start running a structural deficit in fiscal year 2025 that will multiply nearly sixfold by fiscal year 2029, when it will hit $2.93 billion. Not coincidentally, that fiscal briefing estimates implementing the Blueprint will cost more than $4 billion in 2029.\nThe General Assembly's plan for dealing with the cost crunch? There isn't one \u2014 at least not yet. Neither Gov. Wes Moore in his State of the State address nor any of the Democratic state legislators interviewed for this story have offered any potential solutions for the coming Blueprint cash crunch.\n\"Several years from now we're going to have to have a much more direct conversation about the long-term costs,\" said state Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat from Baltimore City. \"But we're not there yet.\"\nRepublicans, meanwhile, see the Blueprint as a budget-breaker.\n\"We cannot pay these billions and billions of dollars in extra monies \u2014 not just state but local as well,\" said House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany). \"We can't pay for them unless you're going to talk about new taxes \u2014 and significant taxes.\"\nThe Blueprint's background\nIn 2016, then-Gov. Larry Hogan and the General Assembly created the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education to assess the public education system in Maryland and determine whether current funding schemes were conducive to student success.\nHeaded by William Kirwan, the former chancellor of the University System of Maryland, the commission came to the conclusion that an overhaul was needed.\n\"One of the 'aha' moments of the commission was really to face the fact that in Maryland, on what we call the Nation's Report Card, Maryland's score was about in the middle \u2026 and moving in the wrong direction,\" said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board, a state entity that's making sure school districts adhere to the plan.\nBut Hogan had an \"aha\" moment of his own after Democrats crafted the Kirwan Commission's report into comprehensive legislation. In 2019, Hogan criticized the pending reform proposal, telling a group of county officials it would mean \"billions and billions more in mandated spending increases for county and state taxpayers,\" according to The Frederick News-Post.\nHogan vetoed the bill creating the Blueprint in May 2020, saying he did not want to raise taxes amid the COVID-19 pandemic to fund the education plan. The General Assembly overrode his veto in 2021.\nAnd the following year, voters elected a strong backer of the Blueprint \u2014 Democrat Wes Moore \u2014 to succeed Hogan, who is now running for a U.S. Senate seat.\nOn the first day of the current legislative session that began in January, Moore said he believes in the reform plan and he will work with the General Assembly to ensure the Blueprint is implemented properly and sustainably.\n\"I believe in the premise and the promise of the Blueprint. I think we need a world-class education system in the state of Maryland,\" Moore said. \"I think that's going to be a prerequisite for us to be able to accomplish the economic goal that we're hoping for.\"\nLofty goals\nIn the state's 24 public school districts, the Blueprint and its lofty goals are already beginning to take shape.\nEach school district has already drawn up a preliminary plan for how it will meet targets for offering pre-K, increasing teacher salaries and improving student performance. The Accountability and Implementation Board has approved all those plans after first asking for revisions.\nThe Blueprint is meant to revamp the state's education system by presenting the same opportunities for all students. With a law like the Blueprint, one size has to fit all to achieve its goals of maximizing reading and math skills, as well as increasing pathways into college, said Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George's and Anne Arundel).\n\"So we want that for every kid across the state. We don't want variation of those goals,\" Rosapepe said. \"Now, the details of how stuff is paid for \u2014 I mean, I think that's a conversation that will be ongoing.\"\nCheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, said the teachers union is fully behind the Blueprint.\n\"We have a shared understanding that our goal is for students to succeed academically and become valuable citizens in our state and in our country,\" Bost said. \"In order to do that, we have to make an investment in public education. I think for the most part, the Blueprint identifies where that money has to go.\"\nWhat it doesn't do, however, is identify where the money will come from. Bost, whose union represents 74,000 educators in the state, acknowledged the concerns about the Blueprint's cost. But she indicated the increased spending on education is both needed and long overdue.\n\"We constitutionally have to provide a public education for all students, so the investment is needed,\" Bost said. \"And when some people balk at, 'Oh, it's all this money' \u2014 well, we've been starving public education for many years.\"\nThe budget dilemma\nThe Blueprint remains fully funded in Moore's latest fiscal year 2025 budget proposal, leaving many lawmakers to turn their attention to other legislative issues this year. Ferguson, the Senate president, said in terms of current Blueprint funding, \"we're more than fine.\"\nBut that's not so in the long term. The cost of implementing the Blueprint is projected to grow from $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $4.1 billion five years later, according to the Department of Legislative Services.\nMeanwhile, the state's structural budget gap is set to balloon every year through 2029 \u2014 when Legislative Services expects it to be $2.9 billion and the Moore administration says it will be about $3.5 billion.\nClosing that budget gap will be immensely difficult, said Christopher Summers, president and CEO of the conservative Maryland Policy Institute, who also said the Blueprint should be paused.\n\"Raising taxes (is) not going to solve this problem, and I think the governor knows that,\" said Summers, who has been critical of the Blueprint for years.\nThe Blueprint calls on school districts to increase education funding too, thereby prompting Summers to say that county budgets face the biggest fiscal threat.\nBut in Annapolis, lawmakers from both parties acknowledged that the General Assembly will have to make some tough decisions in the years to come as the Blueprint's bills come due.\n\"I think we know the reality that we're facing. And I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion about that,\" said State Sen. Guy J. Guzzone, a Democrat from Howard County. \"I just don't know that there's an immediate answer.\"\nOne obvious solution would be raising taxes to cover the state's coming shortfalls. But Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey, a Republican from the Eastern Shore, said a solution lies in cutting back the demands of the Blueprint rather than paying for the sweeping overhaul as it stands.\n\"Republicans have stated very often that we need to move to a 'Blueprint lite' or you know, some type of education reform that takes some of the important components of the Blueprint, but at the same time is affordable and allows counties to make decisions on which parts of the Blueprint are more meaningful in each of their public school systems,\" Hershey said.\nDemocrats, however, back the current Blueprint, despite its cost. Del. Ben Barnes, a Democrat who chairs the Appropriations Committee, said legislators should start talking about a long-term payment plan for the Blueprint now. The shared values between the legislature and the governor will bring them together, Barnes said, to solve the Blueprint budget dilemma.\n\"This legislature, the governor, we share values, and those shared values include all the priorities of the Blueprint,\" Barnes said. \"Getting to children who live in communities of poverty, taking care of special needs students, I mean, these are what we all ran on. And so I feel confident we'll find the revenue we need to support that program.\"\nSeveral state officials have said they are looking to the Accountability and Implementation Board to issue recommendations regarding the Blueprint's budget challenges. The board has made policy proposals included in bills that, if passed this legislative session, would make adjustments to the law without changing the finances.\nIn addition, the board is set to release additional recommendations this legislative session.\n\"What the AIB has tried to sort of suggest is like, let's try to implement it the way it's intended. And if it doesn't work, if it's just no longer the right thing to do, then we need to change it,\" said Hise, the board's executive director. \"But for many things, we haven't gotten to that point yet.\"\nCapital News Service reporters Kiersten Hacker, Christina Walker and Ela Jalil wrote this article.\nCapital News Service reporters Kiersten Hacker, Christina Walker and Ela Jalil wrote this article. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Herzog Foundation.The Herzog Foundation is a national organization dedicated to \"advancing Christian education.\" The foundation enriches Christian (K-12) education by creating and leading various programs.\nOne of these programs was the 2023 Bill of Rights Essay Contest. All middle and high school students enrolled in a Christian school or those homeschooled in the U.S. were eligible to participate. Winners were selected from one middle school and one high school. Each winner would go on to receive $250 from the Herzog Foundation. The winners' schools also received an additional $250.\nParticipants were asked to answer these questions in three pages or less, \"What made the Bill of Rights so revolutionary and unique when it was ratified? How has the Bill of Rights shaped our country?\"\nIn an excerpt from Viana's eloquently crafted three-page essay, the middle school winner wrote, \"The Bill of Rights is famous for that little, life-changing word: freedom, but what most people don't realize is that these documents weren't written overnight. Real people struggled, wrestled, and mulled over each word and phrase that went into the Bill of Rights, until it was finally ratified on December 15, 1791. Not only was it composed through much time and consideration but it secured the rights of people today granting our blessed country to grow, expand, and enter new times of innovation. It summarized what we stood for then and stand for now. It lets a person breathe, work, and earn their way to success.\"\nThe Herzog Foundation announced Viana, daughter of George and Cathy Johnston, as the middle school winner of the contest in December. Johnston received the prize money and a trophy for her achievement.\nIn a release announcing the winners, Herzog Foundation Chairman Todd Graves said, \"The Bill of Rights was ratified over 230 years ago and still stands as a beacon for our most fundamental rights as Americans. It's crucial that all young students understand the significance of this founding document.\"\nKathy Guerra, head of Lighthouse Christian Academy, stated the school was initially in disbelief, as this was the first time their school had made an entry to a contest of this magnitude. However, they were not surprised that Viana had won, as she is a gifted writer who creates masterworks of art with her words. \"Viana is an inquisitive, energetic, and ambitious student,\" says Guerra, who \"seeks to excel in all of her subjects.\"\nTo learn more about the Herzog Foundation and the programs it has to offer, visit www.herzog foundation.com. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The board also heard from Talbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones about the district's research into whether this club could be created at TCPS.\nDuring public comment, Sheriff Joe Gamble spoke on behalf of the Talbot County Sheriff's Office about the importance of having a space for a group of teens to come together and be a part of something.\n\"We all know kids want to be a part of a group, they want to be a part of something,\" he said. \"The Sheriff's Office fully supports another venue for our youth to connect with other people of like-minded and like interests.\"\nAustin Eader, a ninth grader at Easton High School, said that this week he gathered 191 student signatures and 24 teacher and staff signatures from people who support having the club.\nMany of people interested in starting the club, including Talbot Rod & Gun Club President Joe Capozzoli, spoke at a board meeting in October requesting approval to create the club.\nAfter that meeting, TCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi instructed her staff to look into what it would take to make the club happen. At the meeting Wednesday, Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction Helga Einhorn said Jones has been leading that charge.\nJones told the board that the district has been meeting with those interested in starting the club to gather more information. She said the biggest concern right now is figuring out if the club could in any way jeopardize the district financially \u2014 particularly from a risk management perspective.\nShe said that although they have heard about the training and safety precautions required to participate in the program, it still involves putting a firearm in students' hands.\n\"We have to be very thoughtful about that,\" she said.\nThe district has gone to its insurance provider, the Maryland Association of Boards of Education Group Insurance Pool. Jones said a discussion around the topic was held at a February MABE meeting, and MABE intends to hold a session and vote on this at its annual meeting in late April.\nJones said the district will need to consider whether MABE will continue to provide liability coverage if an incident were to happen and, if so, whether it would be at an additional cost. She said the district doesn't have these answers yet because MABE hasn't voted on it yet.\nJones said she should have these answers for the May Board of Education meeting.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said the board and district are at MABE's mercy at this point. She said that as long as MABE has this discussion in April, the board should be able to make a firm decision in May regarding the creation of the club.\nAt the end of the meeting, board member Deborah Bridges said she is on board with the creation of the team.\n\"I think it would be a wonderful addition to our county,\" she said. \"I think it's important because girls can do it too. And there's limited access for females these days. And also for the children that can't do regular athletics, because they can be a part of it too.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He is serving the final months of David Bromwell's term as superintendent. Bromwell officially stepped down from the position March 1.\nBefore taking on the role of interim superintendent, Thompson served as assistant superintendent for DCPS. He began that role in September.\nThompson, who was sworn in to the Talbot County Board of Education in December of 2022, said in an interview that he will miss working on the Talbot County Board of Education.\n\"I've always been on the other side of the fence in relation to education,\" he said. \"But on the board side, I learned a lot about policy, budgeting and things of that nature. So it was a very valuable experience.\"\nHe said his experience as a board member is beneficial to his new role as interim superintendent, particularly when it comes to understanding the relationship between a superintendent and board of education.\nTCPS Executive Assistant Charlene Gould said Thursday that the governor's office has been notified of the District 1 vacant seat. The governor's office is responsible for appointing someone to fill that seat until Thompson's term expires in 2026.\nThompson said his advice for whoever fills his seat is to listen.\n\"I just learned to listen,\" he said about when he started on the board. \"And then make decisions after I listened to what people had to say.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The day is always well received by students and organizations alike, he said.\nCareer coaches work with students throughout the year to identify those who would most benefit from the program, he said.\nStorck was grateful for the collaboration and thanked the high school administration for leading the way for their students to be on the track to greatness.\n\"They are here because they care about the success of their students,\" he said.\nThroughout the day of career discovery, students received one on one individual learning opportunities from professionals through mock interviews and financial guidance workshops.\nChesapeake College also presented information on what vocational classes can do for career growth and continual development.\nA career fair with 30 local businesses welcomed students to discover hiring opportunities and highlighted skills through a multitude of interests available to them right in their own backyard.\nFounder of local IT company Corsica Technologies, guest speaker Dale Walls shared what perseverance can mean for your own story of success.\nWalls recounted his own rocky childhood after which he found structure and direction in the United States Marine Corps before going on to found Corsica Technologies.\nSince stepping down as CEO, Walls has continued his impressive resume, running marathons, coaching youth football and raising a family.\nEncouraging students to take charge of their lives, Walls noted it was perfectly okay not to know what you wanted to do with your life as a high schooler, as long as you were moving forward trying to identify the kind of person you wanted to be.\nTo do that, he reiterated the importance of setting goals with clarity, having courage and leading the way for future self-success.\n\"You are the one who is going to get you there,\" he said.\nThe day of career exploration is very important to the Rotary Club mindset of \"Service Above Self,\" according to Kent Island chapter President Candi Cook.\nThe job fair helps students explore the local area for career opportunities in one convenient place and helps eliminate the misconception that students need to leave the area to find quality jobs.\n\"There are plenty of opportunities for successful post-high school careers that don't require a college degree and taking on tons of debt,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The second tier is for students who need additional support and the last tier is for students who struggle the most with meeting grade level literacy requirements.\nCCPS works in collaboration with the Professional Development Center for Educators at the University of Delaware where officials continue to develop the multi-tier system to ensure CCPS continues to make data informed decisions when matching students with literacy learning resources.\n\"We want to continue the the work we are acknowledged for because our kids deserve it,\" said CCPS's Instructional Coordinator for Elementary English Language Arts, Sherry Eichinger-Wilson.\nThe work of both Eichinger-Wilson and Asplen have allowed CCPS to lead the state for meeting the requirements of the 2019 Ready to Read Act, the science-based program, Science of Reading, and the College and Career Readiness portion of Blueprint for Maryland's Future \u2014 a statewide funding initiative that aims to increase education quality and funding in Maryland.\n\"The focus is to make sure that what we offer in our program is aligned to the Science of Reading,\" Eichinger-Wilson said. \"We have a vertical alignment from grades K-12 and we are continuing to evaluate the parts of our program to ensure that they are aligned and that we are meeting the needs of all of our students.\"\nCecil and Washington County are the only two counties in the state to be deemed as Literacy Learning Lab models for leveraging student support aligned with the Science of Reading to improve literacy outcomes for students in fourth through eighth grade. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland\u2019s teacher shortage: Will the Blueprint\u2019s plan for better pay, training do enough?\n\n March 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AIDAN HUGHES and DARANEE BALACHANDAR Capital News Service | Section: Business \n \n 1505\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fifth-grade teacher Melissa Carpenter works a 10-hour day on average during the week, and her job sometimes requires her to put in hours on weekends, too.\"I feel like teaching is one of those jobs where we go to work to do more work \u2014 to do work after work,\" said Carpenter, who teaches at William B. Wade Elementary School in Waldorf, in Charles County.\nCarpenter's long hours are far from unique among Maryland's educators, as the state and nation grapple with a teacher shortage.\nThe U.S. Department of Education keeps a Teacher Shortage Areas database \u2014 and it found that for the current school year, Maryland was short of teachers in 28 subjects, which the state defines as \"areas of certification.\" That's up from 17 five years earlier.\nSome teacher certification areas \u2014 such as English as a second language, health science and special education \u2014 are short on teachers from pre-K through the 12th grade.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future \u2014 a landmark state law reforming public education \u2014 aims to fix that problem by \"elevating the stature of the teaching profession\" through higher pay, better training and stronger recruitment efforts.\nHowever, experts and educators have mixed views about whether that will successfully address the root causes of the shortage.\n\"Money is a huge help, but it's not everything,\" said Simon Birenbaum, director of grading, assessment and scheduling at Baltimore City Public Schools. \"Human capital is the biggest issue, and money can help with that problem, but recruiting, training and retaining high-quality teachers and staff has to be the primary focus. No amount of money can compensate for a lack of highly-skilled educators.\"\nDocumenting the shortageMaryland's teacher woes follow national trends. The National Center for Education Statistics reported 86% of U.S. K-12 public schools faced challenges in hiring teachers for the current school year.\nAmid the shortage, the Blueprint calls for hiring an unspecified number of additional teachers to ease the workload of classroom veterans.\n\"You hear a lot about the teacher shortage \u2014 and how are we going to implement all these Blueprint programs, which require additional staffing, when we have a teacher shortage?\" asked Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\nShortages stem, in part, from the fact that teachers are leaving the profession. In Prince George's County, 1,126 teachers resigned between July 2022 and July 2023 \u2014 up from 989 the previous year, The Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, 625 resigned in Montgomery County Public Schools, up from 576 a year earlier.\nDorchester County experienced the highest attrition rate in Maryland during the 2021-22 school year at 18%, according to a Department of Education report.\n\"I used to never have people just quit in the middle of the year,\" said Dorchester County Superintendent Dave Bromwell, who recently retired. \"The pandemic told some people, you know what? If you're not happy, move on.\"\nAll those factors end up impacting teachers like Carpenter. She said her grade level saw an influx of students, with around 30 students in her own fifth grade class this year.\n\"Our class sizes are growing, and we don't have the support in place to help some of our struggling learners,\" she said.\n'teaching isn't approved'Schools are suffering from a long-term decline in the number of people interested in becoming teachers.\nThat decline has been ongoing since the mid-'70s, \"but it gets worse and worse and worse, year over year,\" said Mike Hansen, an education policy expert at the Brookings Institution.\nAccording to the State Department of Education, 9,134 people were enrolled in teacher preparation programs in the state in 2012. That number plummeted by about half by 2017, but rose to 6,037 by 2020.\nWhy is teaching becoming less appealing as a career? Zid Mancenido, a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, has been studying that issue.\n\"One of the major findings of my research has been that people are taught over time that teaching isn't a great career,\" he said in a 2022 interview on the school's website. \"There are all these tiny interactions they have over their lifetime that give them this feeling that teaching isn't approved, that they should be aspiring to other careers that might be more prestigious or well-paid.\"\nAmid the shortage, many schools hire less-credentialed \"conditional\" teachers \u2014 those who have not yet received their professional certifications. Maryland's issuance of conditional certificates more than doubled between 2018 to 2022, a state Department of Education report said.\nIn Charles County, where Carpenter works, 12.4% of all teachers held conditional certificates by 2021 \u2014 a rate only surpassed by Baltimore City (13.4%) and Prince George's County (14.3%).\nCarpenter said experienced teachers are leaned on to help the conditional hires.\n\"Which would be fine if you had one or two teachers who needed that support. But we have a massive amount of teachers who are conditional right now,\" she said.\nThe Blueprint's pay bumpIn order to address the teacher shortage, the Blueprint provides a number of measures that lawmakers hope will encourage people to become teachers and ensure that existing ones don't leave for more lucrative out-of-state positions \u2014 or exit the profession altogether.\nA key Blueprint initiative increases teacher pay to a minimum of $60,000 by 2026. In some counties, that means a nearly $15,000 pay bump for new teachers.\nDavid Larner, chief human resource and professional development officer at the Howard County Public School System, said the pay raise will attract teachers from other states and build up Maryland's teacher workforce.\n\"If our salaries are higher than salaries in surrounding states \u2026 then candidates are more likely to come,\" Larner explained.\nHowever, Hansen, of the Brookings Institution, expressed skepticism about the likely impact of the measure on the state's teacher shortage.\nHansen argued that rather than a universal rise in minimum salary levels, money should be targeted where it's needed the most \u2014 attracting teacher talent in high-need schools and specialized fields like STEM subjects and special education. He also highlighted research that suggests salary is just one of many factors that can lead to teacher attrition.\n\"I think we need to be paying teachers more \u2014 I don't think paying a $60,000 minimum wage is the way to do it,\" he said.\nBoosting careers and diversityThe Blueprint also aims to improve teacher quality by encouraging educators to obtain additional training.\nThe plan provides for a salary increase of $10,000 for teachers who become National Board Certified, an advanced teaching credential that fewer than 6% of Maryland teachers held at the start of 2023, according to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. Teachers in high-need areas may see their annual salaries increase by up to $17,000 by becoming certified.\n\"We want to professionalize the career of teaching, and I think that is absolutely what we should be doing,\" said Stephanie Novak Pappas, principal of the Holabird Academy, an elementary and middle school in Baltimore.\nHowever, Hansen questioned the Blueprint's emphasis on National Board certification.\n\"We don't have a lot of evidence that actually getting your NBC makes you a better teacher,\" Hansen said.\nThe Blueprint also calls on school districts to create a diverse workforce. The Accountability and Implementation Board \u2014 which oversees the Blueprint \u2014 will evaluate those efforts.\nA diverse workforce has significant benefits, according to David Blazar, an education policy expert at the University of Maryland.\nBlazar said that increasing the share of Black teachers has \"exceptionally large impacts on students' short and long term outcomes,\" he said. \"I'd say some of the largest impacts I've seen across all of the educational intervention literature.\"\nBut maximizing the benefits of a more diverse workforce will be complicated, Blazar said. Even if the state's teacher workforce came to match the demographics of its students, there would likely still be \"clustering of Black teachers within certain districts, and within certain schools within districts,\" he said.\nHansen echoed those concerns, and said that teachers nationwide remain even more racially segregated than students. Rather than aiming to make the teachers within individual districts reflect the exact racial demographics as their students, he suggested that policymakers should \"maximize exposure and access to a diverse set of teachers for every student\" across different regions.\nA work in progressBeyond the Blueprint, the General Assembly last year passed the Maryland Educator Shortage Reduction Act, which requires the state to set recruitment goals for teacher education programs, creates an alternative teacher prep program for early childhood educators and establishes a $20,000 yearly stipend for eligible student teachers.\nGov. Wes Moore, who proposed the legislation, said upon signing it that it is intended to place \"world class teachers in every classroom.\"\nCarpenter, the Charles County teacher, said future changes may be necessary, too.\n\"We will have new students next year, and they will [have] different needs. So we need to make sure that we are constantly evolving,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Sparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George's County, stressed that reinforcing the teacher workforce is key to the Blueprint's overall success.\n\"It lands in the hands of our educators, and if we don't have educators who are highly qualified or able to do the work, then the Blueprint work would never get accomplished,\" she said.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She smiled at the enjoyment that filled the room. Girls discussed and practiced the best ways to market themselves to achieve their career and education goals.\nHaythe, an economic development veteran and certified economic developer, founded the Foundation of Helping Others Prosper and Excel. Its mission is to help young girls and women lead productive lives in their communities by providing cultural, social, spiritual and educational development.\nThe program serves sixth-grade girls attending middle school. This after-school program covers low self-esteem, bullying, social media, workforce development, economic and community development, financial literacy and more.\n\"We prepare them to be independent and self-sufficient as well as exposing them to opportunities, thought-provoking conversations and activities,\" Haythe said.\nHaythe began the Foundation of HOPE over eight years ago. She said this program has been a community effort since the very beginning.\nDuring the program's early days, Giuffrida's Pizza donated weekly food for the girls to snack on. From there, more and more businesses have assisted in the nutrition of the girls to make sure they are well prepared to learn.\nHaythe said the success of this program would not have been possible without the generous support of volunteers, business partners, board members and donors.\nDuring the pandemic, Haythe and her daughter worked together to create a curriculum for the program. The curriculum, divided into 16 weeks, covered healthy lifestyles, economic development, entrepreneurship and potential futures with education.\nThis week, representatives from Easton Utilities led a presentation by showing a clip from Englehart's favorite movie, \"The Pursuit of Happiness.\" Through the film, Englehart showed the girls how to properly prepare themselves for the working world.\nHe said it was an honor to be invited to speak at the event and support such a commendable foundation. As a human resources professional, he is committed to fostering the growth and development of the next generation by equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to pursue their goals.\n\"I hope it will inspire them to not only envision their future dream jobs but also understand the steps needed to achieve and excel in them,\" Englehart said. \"Moments like these reaffirm my passion for HR and the pivotal role it plays in shaping the workforce of tomorrow.\"\nHis presentation included helping the girls create a career map to reach their goals, developing and practicing an elevator pitch for potential employers, and learning the best ways to write a resume by becoming \"resume detectives\" on practice resumes.\nWhen Englehart finished his presentation, he passed out Easton Utilities swag bags before passing along a final message and gift.\nHe gave each girl his business card and told them that before they started applying for their first job, he would help them develop a resume and do practice interviews to prepare them for the workforce.\nAll the girls crowded around him as Haythe took a photo \u2014 big smiles on everyone's face. Haythe thanked Englehart for his time before cleaning the library with the assistance of the cohort of girls.\n\"This program allows me to use my passion for empowering women and girls through economic development strategies,\" Haythe said. \"This after-school program is an alternative narrative from what they hear from peers and social media. They are setting career goals, and the Foundation of HOPE is here to help them achieve those goals.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Board of Education Member Donna DiGiacomo resigns\n\n March 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: News \n \n 547\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 After three years and four months in office, Caroline County Board of Education member Donna DiGiacomo has resigned, citing concerns following a back-and-forth between DiGiacomo and Superintendent Derek Simmons at the board's March 5 meeting.She emailed her resignation to the Maryland Superintendent of Education Monday.\n\"My problem on the board is I care about the students and I care about teachers,\" she said in an interview Monday afternoon. \"I got a lot of pressure to make it look like we all agreed. But the thing that got me that I finally said I cannot in any way, shape or form be associated with was at the March 5 meeting.\"\n\"The superintendent called some employees minions. I was like 'did you just say minions? Mindless people who just do what you say?'\" she said.\nThe exchange between Simmons and DiGiacomo, which can be viewed in the recorded meeting on the board's website, resulted from a conversation in which the superintendent discussed the district's upcoming switch from Apple laptops to Google Chrome ones.\nHe talks about how many people it took to get the computers ready for summer.\n\"For getting the devices ready for summer, we don't quite need quite the large numbers of minions, as the devices come in more ready to go out the door. So it helps us on that end as well,\" he said in the meeting.\nDiGiacomo asks, \"Minions?... I guess just the word kind of offends me\u2026 'Minions' offends me. It did offend me.\"\nSimmons said, \"I didn't mean to offend you. I was thinking Minion movies.\"\nMembers of the board laughed.\nShe said, \"A minion is a person that does what they, without thinking. That is all. It is derogatory.\"\nSimmons responded, \"Wasn't meant to be offensive, Mrs. DiGiacomo.\"\nShe said, \"I don't think anyone would be appreciative of that,\" before the board returned to their initial discussion.\nSimmons did not directly respond to a request for comment about the exchange, though the school district did issue a press release following DiGiacomo's resignation.\nDiGiacomo's term was supposed to end Nov. 30. She came to the position after 20 years as a high school English teacher.\n\"The main statement I am trying to make by resigning eight months early is I do not want anyone to think that I condone what is going on,\" she said.\n\"... I am not trying to start trouble. I just want people to know that I really did try my best,\" she said. \"But I can't be a part of something that doesn't respect the employees. Calling people minions is not respectful. I don't want people to think I quit. It is a moral thing for me.\"\n\"I think the people who voted for me have the right to know why I made that decision,\" she said.\nThe Board of Education's statement on the resignation thanks DiGiacomo for her time on the board.\nIn it, Board President Richard Barton stated, \"On behalf of the Caroline County Board of Education, we thank Mrs. DiGiacomo for the time she spent on the board and appreciate her service to the staff and students of Caroline County Public Schools.\"\nThe board also said, \"regarding the vacancy this resignation creates, the board will discuss options as they pertain to Maryland law with the board attorney at their next meeting.\"\nThe next meeting is on April 2 at 6 p.m. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wright was described as an excellent, talented and helpful teacher by her students.\nThe evening was filled with excitement as members of the education community dressed up, ate a decadent dinner and were recognized for their work throughout the year.\nPlenty of tears were shed as finalists for the Teacher of the Year and First-Class Teacher of the Year Awards were honored with acknowledgements from their students, mentors and former teachers that had inspired them.\nGavin Parker, principal of Choptank Elementary School, said he enjoyed the time he got to spend at the event.\n\"It's nice to recognize all the hard work that happens in the buildings,\" Parker said. \"We go through a lot. We overcome a lot of challenges. But it's always nice to take some time in the spring to make sure we recognize not only the veteran teachers but the new teachers as well.

    "content": "WKHS celebrates 50 years of student public radio\n\n March 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LISA J. GOTTO Special to the Kent County News | Section: News \n \n 1312\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WORTON \u2014 It's just a normal early morning at 90.5 WKHS when we arrive to the radio station at Kent County High School. As the school's first of four instructional periods commences, so does the first student disc jockey take her place at the microphone in the facility's live on-air studio.Over the next few hours, she'll not only intro and recap songs from an extensive, vetted playlist, but she'll talk to the station's loyal listeners about what's going on at school, in the county and the greater world. The delivery is smooth and polished, and left to the reliability of just one's own ears, you'd never know that this DJ isn't even 18 years old yet.\nToday, senior Emma Morris is joined by senior Averie Hitzges, and the subject of conversation for a bit is a reminder that it is the last day of the station's spring fundraising drive. As is the case with any enterprise of this nature, donations are not only welcomed, but they're vital.\nTo date, those donations have been coming in from loyal listeners and community partners for 50 years \u2014 an amazing feat, especially when you consider that the young people who are populating the air waves with their voices did not grow up listening to traditional radio at all.\nSo in a social culture where it's more likely you're going to listen to a podcast downloaded to your phone during drive-time than a local radio station, how does this eight-studio, 17,500-watt local station remain relevant and a vital part of the high school's Career and Technical Education program?\nAn essential part of that success can be attributed to the current station manager, Chris Singleton. At the helm since 2008, Singleton was quick to point out that he is just one of a long line of integral station managers WKHS has had the good fortune to work with since that first day in 1974 when they went on-air with their format of educational and public affairs-type programming, as well as a wide-ranging playlist that began mid-morning on the March 28.\nAppropriately enough, that first tune played was Elton John's signature hit, \"Rocket Man,\" relayed Singleton, who obviously understands the importance of a mission and knowing when it's time to come back down to Earth.\nWith every school year, he said, he does contend with a student body that might not understand the connection and importance of continuing the legacy of the radio station at the school.\n\"It's like having a kid attend culinary school, when they've never even tasted food,\" he analogized.\nObviously, his plan for getting kids invested is working, as when the bell rings the senior DJs are replaced with equally fresh-faced junior class DJs \u2014 and the next portion of the school-day broadcast continues.\nSenior Lizzy Watkins, 18, is just one of the students who became invested in the program for the 2023-2024 school year. She was at the station that morning conducting a bunch of tasks; everything from providing the morning's weather forecast to working on an on-going project that flexes her creative muscles.\nWatkins aspires to a career in graphic design and gets to try her hand, and brain, at projects geared to such things as part of her role at the station.\n\"So for me, because I'm going into graphic design and marketing, being here allows me to start to feel what it is that graphic designers do when they're being handed something from a customer who asks, 'Hey, can you do this?'\"\nWatkins said the process of being able to create and talk through the collaborative process is giving her valuable real-life experience and has helped build her self-confidence.\nFor junior, Jonah Elburn, 16, it's the sense of professionalism that he feels when enters the station each day.\n\"This is something that I love more than anything. It feels, and everyone says it, not like you're in high school, but you're in a working environment,\" Elburn said. \"There's a professionalism that at least the vast majority of people that step through these doors have, the way everything has grown [here] as a business. This is not just another high school class. This is a business.\"\nSoon after, the \"business-of-broadcasting\" tour took us down a hall where the stacks of LPs and 45s used to be kept for easy access to the then two-studio station. Things have changed quite a bit since then, but not until 2018 did the station have its most comprehensive infrastructure upgrade, Singleton said.\nThe $160,000 station remodel included the addition of six new studios, including an enlarged, on-air studio, a dedicated newsroom, production studios and various equipment upgrades.\nSingleton said they were finally able to address the problem of flimsy, particle-board type walls replacing them with structures that were more acoustically sound, and they were able to incorporate an adjacent classroom into their footprint by taking down a wall. This classroom now houses the station's carefully curated collection of nostalgic radio receivers, audio consoles and other equipment from days gone by that provide a visual history of radio broadcasting.\nOn hand, and actually pitching in for every upgrade, was Singleton and another essential member of the staff, Ken Collins. Collins thoroughly enjoys his part-time role in sales and fundraising for the station, and shares many of Singleton's memories of what it took to get the station to the point where it could be celebrating its 50th year in student public radio.\nCollins' role, said Singleton, was part of a larger initiative dating back to 2013, when Kent County Schools welcomed a new administrator, Dr. Karen Couch. It was at that time, said Singleton, that he was most concerned about the future of the broadcasting program at the high school. There had already been substantial talk about whether or not the station would remain a viable part of the curriculum.\nSingleton was certainly hoping that a new administration didn't signal the demise of one of the school's oldest programs. The advent of new technologies and ways of thinking could easily have derailed the plans he already had for what was needed next to keep it going.\nFortunately, after much in-depth conversation with the superintendent, Singleton learned that he could count on her to support his efforts to keep the program going. Couch, who retires this year, would champion the program again by allowing the station to hire for the part-time fundraising position that Collins would eventually fill.\n\"This would not have happened if we didn't have superintendent-level support,\" Singleton said. \"So, we're hopeful that the incoming superintendent could be just as passionate and just as enthusiastic. I think, hopefully coming off of this 50th anniversary wave and with all the positive community dynamics, the new superintendent will pick up on that and go, 'Yeah, this is something we probably need to keep going.' And until they give me a reason not to, we'll just keep on going.\"\nThe next big thing, said Singleton, is the biggest thing of all. Literally. The station's tower, actually the oldest piece of infrastructure being erected in 1973, now needs to be replaced. This is Singleton's newest mission.\n\"I would much rather be able to replace that proactively, than the alternative of just having it come down on its own.\"\nAnd so, the station's story is still being written and the program continues to inspire the students who reach out to embrace it.\n\"For whom we are and what we have, I am pretty happy for where we are,\" said Singleton.\nAn official station birthday celebration will be held on Saturday, May 4, from 1 to 5 p.m. at Red Acres Farm in Worton. The event called Tune Fest will feature live music from five area bands: Sombarkin', Justin Singleton, Phillip Dutton & the Alligators, The Good Stuff and The Blake Thompson Band. Festival goers also will enjoy a menu of offerings from local food trucks and connecting with many of the station's staff members, past and present. Tickets are $25 per person.

    "content": "Students embrace history once again in regional competition\n\n March 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ERIC SYLVIA Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 578\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS \u2014 Nearly 200 local middle and high school students participated in the annual regional history day event held once again at Chesapeake College.Organized by Queen Anne's County Public Schools teacher Thomas Hayman, the March 23 event welcomed 30 area teachers and a troupe of volunteers who hosted six schools. Schools participating in this year's event represented Caroline, Cecil, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties. This year's theme was Turning Points in History.\nProjects entered this year covered a wide range of topics, as students used a lot of creativity to make their cases.\nTopics covered included pop-culture history, topics related to women's rights and the Great Depression, as well as improvement in technology and even the advent of fast-food and its impact on history.\nThe students work hard to get to this level of the competition by first competing at the local level within their home school. The next step is this regional event, with the winners invited to participate in the Maryland statewide competition.\nAt each level, judges provide feedback the students can use to improve their project for the next competition.\nHayman says the event started as an after-school program he became involved in when he first began his teaching career. As the number of students grew, and the national event began to take shape, local programs also grew.\nEastern Shore counties previously had individual county-level events, but they decided to form a coalition in 2017 in order to be more competitive at the state level.\nThe plan worked \u2014 Hayman reports in the five years the Upper Shore Regional event has been held, two area students have gone on to compete in the national event.\nThe regional event sends the top two from each category, from each county to the state event. The state only sends the top two in each category to the national event.\nThe event is offered in conjunction with National History Day and Maryland Humanities, and it is intended to help foster a love of history in the students who participate. Students submit projects in five categories: Paper (Individual), Website, Performance, Documentary and Exhibit.\nThey can submit content as either individuals or in groups of up to five students. There are now three divisions \u2014 a youth division for students in the fifth grade, the Junior Division for students of grades six to eight and the Senior Division for students grades nine to 12.\nThe regional event is funded by Maryland Humanities, which is also responsible for hosting the state event. Hayman said Chesapeake College also played a vital role, donating the space for the exhibits, presentations and performances free of charge \u2014 a location providing a more central location than previous venues. Food trucks rounded out the day's festivities for the students.\nThese students make a choice to put in extra hours to work on their projects outside of their normal school work, Hayman said. Many of the students who participate, come back multiple years to compete, each year improving their research and presentation skills. The amount of effort and dedication these projects require rivals similar science contests.\nWhile not all participants went home with an award, the judges handed out over 50 awards to the students, including: Sports History Award, Heritage Award, Natural History Award, Military History Award, Contemporary World History Award, African American History Award, Colonial History Award, Equality in History Award, Medical History Award, and the Chesapeake Bay/Maritime Award. First, second and third place finishes as well as Best in Region awards were also given in each category. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In education, tier one instruction is instruction given to the entire classroom.\n\"Right now we see the deficit across the district as it relates to tier one instruction,\" Thompson said. \"And this is the way that we think we're going to improve our tier one instruction, by providing professional development to our leadership.\"\nThompson said the district has to put its money where its mouth is.\n\"We're trying to shift our mindset to put instruction first,\" he said. \"And we believe that this is the way to do it: By training our staff and training our leadership to be instructional leaders.\"\nThompson said Creative Leadership Solutions will cater their services to what the district needs.\nAt a Cambridge City Council meeting later that day, Thompson gave a presentation to the council on the overall picture of the school system where he talked about the need for improving tier one instruction. He spoke about the importance of having a school calendar that allows the district to provide time for professional development.\n\"We can't expect teachers to be good at their craft if we're not continuously training them to be better at their craft,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jamie Raskin's planned lecture on democracy Thursday at the University of Maryland instead turned into a lively discussion on the Israel-Hamas conflict.Raskin was invited to give the Irving and Renee Milchberg Endowed Lecture and his intended subject was \"Democracy, Autocracy and the Threat to Reason in the 21st Century.\"\n\"Progress in history requires not just reasoning, which is certainly necessary, but it's not sufficient, because it also requires the addition of the pro-social emotions, as the psychologists call it, of solidarity, empathy, love and the political virtues of justice and equality and freedom,\" Raskin said at the start of his speech.\nHis remarks were interrupted just a few minutes later by pro-Palestinian protesters shouting that Raskin is was \"complicit in genocide.\" In response, Raskin said that he wished the protesters had engaged in a conversation with him, rather than \"heckling.\"\nRaskin emphasized that he has taken a strong position on returning the hostages held by Hamas, has advocated a military ceasefire, and has championed a two-state solution. As he attempted to continue his lecture, protesters continued interrupting and shouting. Various protesters questioned Raskin's actions since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\"We need a new peace movement too, if you are the representatives of it,\" Raskin said. \"Because you're not engaging in real dialogue with people and you're not convincing anybody.\"\nProtesters supporting Israel and those backing Palestine from both sides continued heckling and arguing with each other, making it impossible for Raskin to continue. He then abandoned the speech and said he was open to taking questions from the audience, leading to more discourse among protesters.\n\"It's very tough to solve problems in the Middle East here at the University of Maryland in the physics department,\" Raskin said.\nDarryll Pines, the president of the university, later stepped in and terminated the lecture early.\n\"He came here to speak about where our democracy is going in our country,\" Pines told Capital News Service. \"What you saw play out actually was democracy and free speech and academic freedom. From our perspective as a university, there are the difficult conversations that we should be having.\"\nPines added that he wished, however, that the protesters had been more civil. He also praised Raskin's patience and empathy when responding to the protesters' comments and questions.\n\"I wanted to make a plea for constitutional patriotism in defense of democracy and freedom around the world,\" Raskin told CNS about his original speech. \"Their sentiments were perfectly consistent with a lot of what I had to say.\"\n\"I'm not really opposed to heckling,\" the congressman added. \"But it seems like heckling today is all about drowning out the speaker, and that's totally antithetical to the spirit of free expression.\"\nHoward Milchberg, University of Maryland professor of physics and electrical and computer engineering, along with his wife Rena Milchberg and their three children, started the lecture in 2019. It celebrates the memory of Howard Milchberg's late parents, who survived the Holocaust.\n\"It didn't go as planned, but it maybe turned out better than normal,\" Howard Milchberg told CNS. \"It was an actual exercise of democracy rather than a story about democracy.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She became a school librarian 10 years ago and has served as a high school teacher for the past five years. She said she applied for the vacant seat because she saw it as an opportunity to continue to serve the school system.\n\"It is important, with a lot of the things that are coming up for Dorchester County Public Schools, that District 2 has a voice in making those decisions,\" she said. \"Because, by and large, most of the school children in the county are in this district.\"\nIn a press release, the County Council said it believes the board will benefit from Chikwendu's institutional knowledge from working in the district.\nChikwendu was appointed to fill the rest of Theresa Stafford's term, which ends in 2026. Stafford, who was elected to the Board of Education in 2022, passed away in mid-December after battling cancer for several years.\nChikwendu said her first order of business as a board member is to figure out exactly where the district is right now.\n\"I mean at this point in the year, we are in the middle of budget season, we are about to end the school year,\" she said. \"At this point, it's a function of acclimating myself to just what is happening and where I'm needed.\"\nChikwendu said she wants to be of service to the community.

Though the state of Maryland wasn't on the path of totality, the moon blocked out nearly 90 percent of the sun at about 3:20 p.m. Monday over the Country School.\nTeachers prepared for the eclipse by teaching students about eclipse viewing safety and the science behind an eclipse.\nA solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, thereby obscuring the view of the sun from a small part of Earth, totally or partially.\nJean Waller Brune, acting head of school at The Country School, said preparing for the solar eclipse was wonderful.\n\"It's amazing to be here and help our students understand what a solar eclipse is and how to look at it safely,\" Brune said. \"They've all been little scientists out here, and to do it together in community as a school is just a thrill.\"\nIn science classrooms, students labeled on worksheets the eclipse process while watching a NASA live stream of the celestial event.\nAs the eclipse neared, students sat outside eagerly watching the sun through their brightly decorated eclipse masks made from colored paper plates and certified eclipse glasses.\nWhen the eclipse finally reached a moment of near totality, teachers and students alike watched in excitement as the sky darkened and the moon slowly covered the sun.\nAnn Hansen, pre-k teacher's assistant, said it meant a lot to her to share this moment with her students.\n\"They will hopefully remember this for a long time,\" Hansen said. \"It makes me so happy that we can do something like this at our school.

And my students are my family, and my coworkers and my friends are my family,'\" he said.\nHillyard has taught at EHS since 2010. He is currently working to create a mentorship program for Hispanic students to support their success.\nEHS Principal Sherry Spurry said Hillyard \"branched out from the foreign language department\" this year to teach algebra after recognizing a need for support.\n\"This is just one example of Mr. Hillyard's willingness to support student success regardless of the extra responsibilities or work it entails for him,\" Spurry said.\nSteele has worked at EHS since 2018. EHS School Manager Toni Hall said Steele works \"extremely hard\" to provide support to students in math through translating, tutoring and making sure students understand the concepts. Hall said one of the greatest challenges English as a second language teachers face is having new students enter the program throughout the year.\n\"Ms. Steele is invaluable in helping these students prepare to move into algebra, a critical step in their educational journey,\" Hall said. \"She always greets new students with a smile, making them feel welcome and comfortable, and helping them learn an unfamiliar concept.\"\nRegina Coleman, school security officer at Easton Middle School, and Chanae Neal, an instructional assistant for special education at Easton Elementary School, were also finalists for the Support Staff of the Year title.\nLutisia Blessing, a pre-K teacher at White Marsh Elementary School, and Marissa Carter, a third-grade math teacher at St. Michaels Elementary School, were the finalists for the Teacher of the Year title.\nHillyard congratulated his fellow finalists in his speech.\n\"I emailed them last weekend. I said, 'I wish there could be three teachers of the year instead of one,'\" he said. \"It's such an honor to stand in the middle of two other amazing educators, and I'm so glad I work with you.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chesapeake College shapes Eastern Shore's future\n\n April 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CLIFFORD P. COPPERSMITH | Section: Columns \n \n 750\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The new Chesapeake College brand, launched this academic year, highlights our role in preparing our students for \"what's next.\" Our students choose their own goals \u2014 whether that is transfer to a bachelor's degree program or entry into a career \u2014 but our job is to help them acquire the relevant skills, knowledge and experiences to be successful.This role is at the heart of what our faculty, staff, and administrators do each day. We love to see our students succeed and move on to what's next in their lives. These individual successes echo throughout our community on the Eastern Shore, bolstering a vibrant economic cycle that benefits everyone in our service area.\nOur efforts yield tangible results in our community. When we empower individuals with the skills they need to succeed, we are not only transforming lives but also strengthening our local economy. A skilled workforce attracts businesses, drives innovation, and fosters economic growth. Chesapeake College is proud to be a catalyst for positive change in our community, creating pathways to prosperity for all.\nOur collaborative endeavors with partners in K-12 education, four-year institutions, local businesses, and economic leaders are crucial. This year we hosted nearly 150 of these partners at our Program Advisory Committee mixer \u2014 our largest to date. Together, we create curricula that resonate with real-world demands, ensuring both our credit and noncredit programs offer engaging and pertinent learning experiences. This collaboration is vital as we align our educational offerings with the needs of the workforce and the expectations of our community.\nThe influence of Chesapeake College graduates is unmistakable across various sectors. Once again, our nursing program boasted a 100% pass rate on the National Council of Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses. As a result of partnership with our public schools, local educators are taking classes to become certified teachers, and others are earning a childcare development associate certificate, helping to fill critical gaps for early childhood education. From health care to education, construction trades to computer science, our alumni are integral to the local workforce.\nWe recognize that not every great career requires the traditional college path. Careers in the skilled trades can be lucrative and rewarding for students, developing a broad variety of talents as well as skills in problem-solving, customer service, and communication.\nThis year, responding to the needs of local employers, Chesapeake expanded our trades offerings and launched a new advanced manufacturing program. We now have students learning the latest skills with hands-on experience using 3D printers, CNC machines, and robotics, preparing them for the high-tech jobs of tomorrow. Additionally, we continue to expand existing offerings in construction, HVAC, welding and marine services.\nOur enrollment is up 9.5% this year, continuing the growth we celebrated last year. This increase is a testament to the relevance and appeal of our programs \u2014 as well as to the impact of Maryland Blueprint for Education legislation, which expands opportunities for dual enrolled high school students. It prompts us to consider sustainable strategies for addressing the accompanying challenges, including funding and tuition adjustments, to ensure that our growth remains inclusive.\nWe continue doing our work as effectively and efficiently as possible, stewarding the critical resources provided by our state, our five support counties, and our students. As we all know, resources are tight and the state of Maryland faces challenges in funding higher education. We appreciate the support we receive from all of our funding authorities and will continue to be responsible stewards as we make every effort to serve our students and our regional community to the best of our ability.\nAs we look to the future, it's essential to recognize the challenges ahead. Access to education remains a pressing issue, with many individuals facing barriers such as financial constraints, lack of transportation, or childcare responsibilities. Addressing these challenges requires a collective effort from policymakers, community leaders, and educational institutions like Chesapeake College. We must work together to ensure that everyone has equal access to the opportunities afforded by education.\nAt Chesapeake College, we are dedicated to fostering the skills that will drive the future, preparing our students to face tomorrow's challenges with confidence and competence. Together, we are setting the stage for a thriving, prosperous future on the Eastern Shore.\nAs we continue to cultivate optimism through our actions and initiatives, I invite you to share in the vision of a promising future here at Chesapeake College \u2014 a treasure of the Eastern Shore, steadfast in its mission to empower individuals and enrich our community.\nClifford P. Coppersmith is the president of Chesapeake College. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Beyond Words brings creative and innovative opportunities to the Shore\n\n April 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TAMARA FORTE Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 887\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE \u2014 As a special education teacher and a parent to a dyslexic child, Lindsey Parte has lived through the struggles and tears of traditional education and understands firsthand the challenges that affect all types of learners.Parte has focused her 18-year teaching career on teaching struggling learners how to read. Working with students in kindergarten through high school, she is a structured literacy dyslexia specialist and certified in Orton Gillingham. Parte's mission is to increase educational resources for not only her local community \u2014 the children of the Eastern Shore \u2014 but for all children no matter where they live.\nThis is where Beyond Words Tutoring was born.\nBeyond Words Tutoring is a new educational business, located at The Edge Area on 325 Log Canoe Circle in Stevensville. It offers four innovative services: a hybrid homeschooling program, virtual dyslexia tutoring, academic summer camps, and non-attorney special education advocate services.\nThis licensed, part-time hybrid homeschooling program is creative and flexible and welcomes students ages 6 to 11.\nParte explains the program \"supports families who want to homeschool, but cannot commit to it full-time. It's the opportunity to do school and life with other families. To teach them in creative and innovative ways. It's child-led learning.\"\nThe program is three days a week Monday, Tuesday and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and will operate from Sept. 9 to May 15, 2025. The program allows for longer holiday breaks and does not follow the typical school calendar. Currently, there are 11 available spots with a small \"class\" size to allow for small group 1:1 attention.\nBeyond Words Hybrid Homeschooling Program is a microschool that is open to all learners, not just dyslexic learners. This educational alternative aims at reducing student wait time, enriching past a set of grade-level expectations, going beyond a fixed curriculum and meeting the individual's needs.\nA microschool is a non-traditional educational setting where students are learning side-by-side with learners of various ages and abilities. Think of it like a one room schoolhouse, Parte explains.\nMicroschools have become increasingly popular as families are desiring more personalized and engaging learning for their children. The students enrolled at Beyond Words Hybrid Homeschool Program are considered homeschooled students which allows parents to have more involvement in their child's education. This also means that parents are the ones responsible to meet the compulsory attendance laws under COMAR.\nThe focus of the homeschool group is math and reading. Parte said a lot of families who want to homeschool do not want to focus on being the only one teaching their child to read. She said, \"for many reasons families do not want to focus on teaching reading. It may not be in their wheelhouse, or they don't feel comfortable. So, for me to take (the reading and math) off (the parents') plate\" helps in many ways.\nBesides math and reading, the hybrid homeschool program also includes: nature, STEAM/Science Maker Space activities, arts and crafts, and kindness activities. Since the classroom location backs right up to Terrapin Nature Park, weekly activities may include nature sketching, hiking, going on adventures, forest bathing (meditative walks), community service projects and compassion circles.\nParte said she is \"huge into the mental health aspect and teaching the kids self-regulation and growth mindset.\" And stresses that she \"is building a community where the kids feel safe and comfortable. It's building a family. It is teaching them to be okay with who they are and teaching them to look out for each other and others in our community.\"\nIn order to gain a hybrid homeschooling program spot for the 2024-25 school year, there is a screening process to ensure it is a good fit for the family and the teacher. There is a curiosity form online for those interested.\nVirtual dyslexia tutoring is another offered resource. Currently these tutoring sessions utilize Orton Gillingham, are one-on-on and are individualized. Ages 6 through high school are welcome. Parte is currently tutoring middle school students as far as California, as there is a need for her specialized training everywhere.\nTutoring openings occur later at night, 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. as needed. For the 2024-25 school year, there will be nine openings for the virtual tutoring spots.\nAnother resource at Beyond Words is the academic summer camp, which prevents summer slide, or educational regression, over the summer in an atmosphere that also encourages meeting like-minded friends.\nCamp activities include math, reading, writing, STEM and more. Last year, Parte said she drove her son, Lincoln, three hours to be a part of a similar dyslexic school camp. After driving that far, Parte is excited to bring this resource closer to all those on the Eastern Shore. The camp runs from July 29 to Aug. 16 from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.\nStudents can participate in one or more of the three-week camp programs.\nThe last available service at Beyond Words Tutoring is non-attorney special education advocate services. These consulting and advocacy services empower parents to be effective advocates for their children in the Individualized Education Program process. This includes understanding the IEP documents as well as ensuring all your child's academic and behavior needs and goals are met.\nCurrently, Beyond Words Tutoring is still looking for donations of comfortable seating (like bean bags and foam seats), rugs, tables, chairs, art and crafts supplies, paper, markers, old legos, building blocks and other school supplies.\nFor more information visit www.beyondwordstutoring.com or email lindseyparte@beyondwordstutoring.com. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "School board looks at changing name of school bearing name of Revolutionary War general, former governor who owned slaves\n\n April 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Matt Wynn mwynn@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 382\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n General Smallwood Middle School in southern Maryland may soon be no more.The Charles County Board of Education reviewed the process to change the name of the school and the price tag associated with it at their April 16 meeting because concerns had been raised over Gen. William Smallwood being a slave owner.\nJack Tuttle, a content specialist for the school system, elaborated on Smallwood's history from his findings in the Maryland state archives.\nSmallwood was born in 1732 and grew up in Charles County, and his family had already been wealthy plantation owners before his birth, Tuttle's presentation said.\nIn 1761, Smallwood became a Charles County delegate to the assembly and served in the seat for 11 years prior to the Revolutionary War.\nHe joined Charles County's committee of correspondence in 1774, which was a political organization against the British that was dedicated to spreading information, Tuttle's presentation said.\nIn 1776, Smallwood joined the Revolutionary War effort as a colonel, then eventually brigadier general of the First Maryland Regiment. He was promoted to major general based on campaigns throughout the East Coast.\nBy 1790, Smallwood owned 4,350 acres in Charles County and had 56 enslaved people working on his plantation. He served as Maryland's governor from 1785 to 1788 before he died in 1792, Tuttle said.\nCharles public school system will survey the community to garner perspective from students, staff, families, the Smallwood school feeder community, elected officials and advocacy groups on changing the school's name, Superintendent Maria Navarro said.\nNavarro proposed that all outreach would take place throughout May and early June and the results of the survey would be presented at a June board of education meeting.\nThe cost of changing the school's name could span anywhere from $64,500 to $124,500, with most of the variance coming from the type of sign the school chooses, according to Tuttle and Navarro's presentation. A traditional sign would cost about $10,000, while an LED digital sign would cost upward of $70,000.\nOther potential costs include $35,000 for exterior school lettering, $3,000 for school graphic window film, $10,000 for school plaques, $1,000 for school banners and $5,500 for athletic uniforms.\nNavarro reminded board members of Board Policy 7230, which states that a vote to rename the school cannot be held until at least three intervening school board meetings after notification to the school's community. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One by one, students were moved throughout the kitchen and shown the behind-the-scenes of sweet treats and rich desserts.\nJulia Foxwell, director of community engagement for Bluepoint Hospitality, said it was a delight for the chefs to share their passion for sweets with the students.\n\"We have been working with the Chesapeake Multicultural Center for some time on how best to support their initiatives while also providing enriching experiences to their students,\" Foxwell said. \"Bringing the girls and boys in to learn kitchen basics \u2014 from prep to final product \u2014 exposes them to new concepts, flavors and perhaps a future passion of their own. Chefs (Harley) Peet and Heim loved hosting the kids in the kitchen and even got a few ideas for new flavors.\"\nVictoria Gomez Lozano, Hispanic outreach coordinator for Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said this program is important in reaching out to community members who may not know about the center's services.\n\"We started this program to give the underserved children of this community the opportunity to have extracurricular activities and to be exposed to a lot of things that they may not have the opportunity to,\" Gomez Lozano said. \"It's also a good way to contact their parents and the families in the community as well so they can open up to us and so we can give them our services.\"\nAt the end of the tour, every student was given a scoop of ice cream and a choice of toppings to create their own flavor.\nEach student enjoyed the ice cream while laughing with friends.\nStudent Yerelin Fuentes said she has been in the after-school program for a few years now and loves the chance to learn new things and spend time with her friends outside of class. But what she loves most, she said, is the ability to learn to be a good person.\n\"They show us how to be a hero,\" Fuentes said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This is for someone who is not thinking about college right now or has not gone out looking for a job or has but has no immediate prospects.\nMaryland has created the Department of Service and Civic Innovation that can be found at dsci.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx. If you are a business or nonprofit organization or run a local government, you can sign up to be a host site for graduating seniors or former high school graduates where they can work for a year with the state paying a minimum salary of $15 an hour and health insurance being provided along with $6,000 being set aside for higher education.\nIf you are a young person with no or unsure plans on what you are going to do after graduation or have graduated and do not have a job, you can sign up and find a position where you might be able to work. Work sites have to sign up by May 1 for this group of young people to work and youth have until later in May to sign up. It is a great opportunity for the community, businesses and nonprofits to help our youth build their abilities to work, be mentored and meet other young people from all over the state.\nThis year there were no youth from Dorchester County that applied for a job through this program.\nWith regard to scholarships, earlier this week I learned at a community meeting held by Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) about the Commission on Higher Education. Derrick Colley came and spoke about all of the money that is available through the state for higher education for youth, adults, people who work for the state or local governments and others. The link to that website is mhec.maryland.gov/about/pages/contactus.aspx. I also learned that all of our state delegates and senators have money available themselves for financial aid to students, and they can seek that help by contacting the legislators' offices to learn more.\nThe most interesting and unfortunate thing that I learned about these resources is that every year there is money left over and not used because not enough people seek the assistance.\nI also learned from the conversation among those attending Sample-Hughes' meeting that many of our youth are not motivated to fill out the online application forms and that the way many who attended had to do it was to sit their young family member in front of the computer and help them through the process.\nIf you are reading this and want to help yourself or a family member, go to both websites first and learn more about them and then find that person who needs a job or a scholarship and sit down with them and help them get started.\nStephen Rideout is mayor of Cambridge. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Candidates compete for 3 open Dorchester Board of Education seats\n\n April 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 3224\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Dorchester County Board of Education has three position on the ballot this year for Districts 1, 3 and 5. There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 1 and 5 will appear on the ballot of May 14's primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election. The District 3 candidates will not be on the ballot until November, since only two candidates are registered.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the eight candidates competing for the seats to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity and length. Extended versions of these Q&As are available at stardem.com.\nMIKE HARTFORDMike Hartford is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nFirst-hand knowledge from a parent standpoint on current issues. Outside perspective, from not only a parental standpoint, but from a business standpoint. As a small business owner I feel I have the tools necessary to communicate issues effectively and provide reasonable solutions when problems do arise.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nWe need to focus more on our local needs and suggestions, rather than what the state suggests. Our county is run by the students and the parents. The current board needs to be aware of that. It is about the kids, always.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nMaryland's Blueprint itself is a great concept. We need to adapt to these guidelines and utilize the tools and knowledge we have of our local community to expand the idea further. For Instance, teacher incentives, pay raises and teacher appreciation should be at the forefront of our focus. These are the people who guide the students in the right direction. We need to attract the best talent so we can provide the children the best education they can get. Our country's future depends on it.\nCHRISTINE LAMONICAChristine LaMonica is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a prospective member of the Board of Education, I bring a commitment to fostering positive change and ensuring that every student receives the best possible education in a safe environment.\nI bring a true passion for advocacy for our students, families, and educators to ensure that their voices are heard, and their needs are met within our educational system. This will include advocating for resources for all schools regardless of their socioeconomic status or location, as I believe in the power of inclusive education that celebrates diversity and promotes a sense of belonging for every student.\nAs a board member I would promote transparency and collaboration in decision making. I am looking forward to visiting the schools and listening to the needs of each district, I believe that is paramount in understanding the culture of our schools. I recognize that to make progress, the Board functions best when the members work together towards common goals with open communication and respect.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward? How do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nI am going to combine this question along with the question regarding the Blueprint. Overall, the board and district should work together towards the common goal of student safety, success in learning, and wellness for all students first and foremost, the Blueprint hopefully being a roadmap to help us meet certain objectives.\nAs a candidate and community member I see the Blueprint as a \"challenge,\" and one that has the potential to bring good to our schools, albeit nothing is perfect or easy. As a candidate I think the county and the board are addressing the issues of funding and staffing regarding the requirements of the Blueprint and the future of our education system the best they can right now with the resources available to them. The county and the board are going to have to be creative and resilient with the challenges ahead. We aren't alone or singled out in Dorchester County. Larger counties are facing challenges also. They may have more resources to pull from, but larger populations to serve. We all have our specific barriers to overcome. We see this not only in the education system, but in many public service arenas.\nLUCAS THORPELucas Thorpe is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a candidate for the Board of Education, I bring a unique blend of experience, passion, and dedication to student success. Having previously served as a student member on the board, I understand the inner workings of the education system and the challenges that students face firsthand. This experience has equipped me with valuable insights into the needs and aspirations of our student population.\nIn addition to my board experience, my current work in the nonprofit sector serving Dorchester County Public Schools students has further deepened my understanding of the issues affecting our educational system. Through my role, I have developed innovative programs and initiatives aimed at supporting student growth and achievement.\nI am committed to fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and excellence within the board. My goal is to ensure that every decision made reflects a student-first mindset and contributes to the overall improvement of our educational system.\nFurthermore, I am dedicated to promoting innovation and equity in education. I will work tirelessly to advocate for resources and programs that empower all students to reach their full potential, regardless of their background or circumstances.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe goals that the board and district need to be working toward are multifaceted and require a comprehensive approach to address the challenges facing Dorchester County Public Schools. First and foremost, we need to prioritize improving academic outcomes and student achievement. Currently, DCPS is ranked 23 out of 24 systems in the state of Maryland, which is unacceptable. We must work tirelessly to elevate our educational standards and ensure that every student receives a high-quality education that prepares them for success.\nTo achieve this goal, we need to focus on several key areas:\nLeadership and support.Parent and community involvement.Addressing chronic absenteeism.Discipline and behavioral remediation.College and career readiness.\nThe board and district need to prioritize academic excellence, foster parent and community involvement, address chronic absenteeism and discipline issues, and promote college and career readiness.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nAs a law passed in the Maryland State Legislature, my stance on the Blueprint is clear: I fully support its objectives and initiatives.\nNow, the conversation shifts to how our school system will implement and stay on track with what is outlined in the Blueprint.\nOne key aspect of the Blueprint that I strongly endorse is Pillar 2, which focuses on high quality and diverse teachers and leaders. This pillar mandates that local school systems implement new teacher ladders, including a minimum teacher salary of $60,000 by fiscal year 2026. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of partnering with Historically Black Colleges and Universities to increase and support the pipeline of diverse teachers and leaders. Increasing teacher pay is essential for Dorchester to remain competitive and attract top talent to our schools.\nHowever, it's important to note that while I fully support the Blueprint, it is not currently fully funded by the State of Maryland. Despite a budget surplus in fiscal year 2023, the state is projected to face a structural budget deficit of $761 million by fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2024, DCPS received $58,118,000 in direct state funding and $24,006,038 in funding from the county. Historically, our county commissioners have funded education locally at around 0.0-1.0% above the Maintenance of Effort, whereas neighboring Wicomico County funds at roughly 5.0-10.0% above the MOE. As leaders in the school system and the county council, it's imperative that we collaborate to find ways to fully fund initiatives and programming efforts locally.\nSUSAN MORGANSusan Morgan is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Morgan is the current Board of Education vice president.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nRaise the academic performance of all students in every school, with a particular focus on reading and math.Make kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.Reduce chronic absenteeism.Implement an effective alternative education program to address disruptive behavior at every level.Refuse to accept violent behavior by imposing serious and predictable consequences on such behavior.Increase fiscal responsibility and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe Board of Education is directing DCPS to implement the Blueprint requirements within the required timelines. However, sufficient funding to meet these mandated requirements is not being provided by the State of Maryland. Lack of adequate funding will require hard, but informed choices over the next several years. Unless increased funding is provided or implementation deadlines are modified, it may impossible to meet Blueprint requirements going forward.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have worked constructively with all individuals and groups who have the success of our students as their goal. For example, Mike Diaz (2023-24 Board President, 2022-23 Vice President) and I (2022-23 President, 2023-24 Vice President) have markedly different political views, but we have worked extremely well together to generate the constructive change needed for our children to succeed. Actions of the Board under our leadership over the past two years have resulted in the following accomplishments:\nStudent Achievement: The Board is now monitoring student achievement using structured reports prepared by the DCPS Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessments. As a result, we now have reliable data demonstrating that our students' test scores are improving somewhat is some areas.Kindergarten Readiness: Importantly, 42.4% of students enrolled in pre-kindergarten programs demonstrate readiness for kindergarten. Overall Kindergarten readiness has improved with 39% of students demonstrating readiness in Fall of SY2023-2024 (versus 32% in SY2022-2023 and 29% in SY2021-2022).Programs to Address Disruptive Behavior: This year, the Board has finally implemented a structured alternative education program that includes both academic and social/emotional components (with both an on-campus and an off-campus high school program) that is showing measurable results. Functional Family Therapy delivered in the student's home is an important component of this program. A request for proposals to develop and implement similar on-campus programs at the elementary and middle school levels has been posted.Increased Fiscal Responsibility and Accountability: Over the past two years, the Board President and Vice President have initiated increased scrutiny of budget development and detailed justifications of spending requests. The Board now requires that concrete performance and outcome measures be specified for funded programs and for contracts with external organizations. In preparation for SY 2024-25, we are going back to the basics with our budget. Every dollar is being scrutinized, including costs of maintenance, function, administration and teachers. Costs have often been carried over from year-to-year without evaluation.School Safety: School safety has been improved demonstrably. We have supplied all of our secondary schools with weapons detection systems and installed fences around many of our schools. In addition, the board now refuses to accept violent behavior and is willing to impose serious and predictable consequences for violent behavior.Website Redesign: Comments from users indicated that the previous DCPS website failed to provide important information, was difficult to navigate, and lacked effective mechanisms for getting information out to the community. The Board directed DCPS to develop a new website that would incorporate an integrated communication system to address these deficiencies. After much discussion and review, the new website and communication system were installed and became operational this year.Increased Communication with the County Council:The board president and vice president have met regularly with the president and vice president of the County Council to foster an understanding of DCPS needs and programs and to address wider areas of concern, such as juvenile justice challenges.\nMIKE DIAZMike Diaz is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Diaz is the current Board of Education president.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nElection of the right candidates is what will be working toward for the district. The Board members working with the superintendent are highly focused on retention and accountability within the system. As with any large company, or in our case school district, change doesn't occur over night and neither do results. I feel we are moving rapidly in the right direction.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nOur job as the duly elected members to the school district is to govern the district and work with the superintendent. He manages the district and, specifically, the Blueprint requirements. The county government provides us the Maintenance of Effort funding to which we and the superintendent account for in the budget. This funding accounts for roughly 20% of the DCPS budget.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI was elected in 2020 and, shortly after taking office, the pandemic occurred, slowing everything down. That being said, I ran on safety and security and accountability as my main focus. Since then we added a layered security apparatus that involves weapon detection systems, security camera upgrades, security vestibules, etc. We had the superintendent hire a director of security and an assistant superintendent to focus on safety and accountability directly in the schools.\nAlternative Education at the secondary level was something I wanted to ensure was available to the district when these students displayed undesirable behaviors and were, in most cases, sent home or suspended long term. Although DCPS by law still has to provide them educational services, many students never completed those tasks and were in the community being unaccountable. Making the investment in alternative education now ensures that there is a program in place in each high school for students that are experiencing difficulty in their normal setting.\nStudents that are placed on long term suspension are asked to participate in the off-campus alternative education program in Woolford and are there for an average of 44 days. This is in collaboration with the student and the parents. Many of the students are also given the opportunity to participate in the Functional Family Therapy program that is also offered as an intensive in-home wrap-around service.\nI can't think of a better example of the term \"equity\" than this. Providing structural, long-term, evidenced-based services to our most at risk populations.\nThis Board also approved a three year agreement with the educators, increasing their compensation to meet the Blueprint standards.\nThe overall goal is to provide the community the best education possible. DCPS is currently 23 out of 24 in Maryland, something the acting superintendent reminds us of frequently. We didn't get here overnight. I feel more confident that we are charging ahead with the mentality of accountability at all levels. This approach will shape the management and leadership culture in the district and will have a direct effect in the learning process.\nBRANDY DAWSON CUMBERLANDBrandy Dawson Cumberland is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nA fresh perspective as a parent and invested community member, without a private agenda. I have studied and implemented quality initiative projects throughout my doctoral studies. I am serious about safe, evidence-based and data-driven solutions while remembering the uniqueness and diversity of our large school district. Additionally, as a mental health professional, I aim to serve our community, and the future of our community is our children.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nGoals must prioritize safety, transparency, learning, retaining quality educators and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nWhile the Blueprint has been passed at the state level, several districts are in a similar situation to Dorchester. We must continue working with local and state legislators to advocate for resource allocation to allow for implementation.\nCHRIS WEEDLETONChris Wheedleton is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. He is currently serving as District 5 board member.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe board and district leadership established and aligned on a strategic plan last year that lays out clear goals for improvement and growth. Those goals were translated into scorecards and metrics in every area of the strategic plan including academic success, school/family/community partnerships, school safety & climate, high quality workforce and operational efficiency. We have shifted the monthly board meetings to put student outcomes and deliverables in each area at the forefront of what we focus on and post the outcomes on the DCPS website after every meeting to ensure transparency and clarity for all community stakeholders. Continuous improvement in every one of those areas is what the district needs to and is working towards. Check out the plan at: https://www.dcps.k12.md.us/o/dcps/page/parents\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nIn an honest and open way. That includes how we are working to understand and stay compliant with the guidelines that have been and continue to be laid out from the state, which we are currently doing through our Blueprint coordinator, Dr. Boyd. It also includes sharing with all stakeholders what is working and not working for our District and community. There are multiple elements of Blueprint that need to be refined in order for it to help support the unique needs of Dorchester County. The board and superintendent continue to share those with state and local officials so that they understand, from the educator's perspective, what the implementation looks like on the ground. Working together to understand and try to improve what is needed for our county is important. There are positive aspects that have brought resources in the area of workforce development and career planning for students, as well as areas like early childhood that have yet to be structured in ways that work in Dorchester County.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have enjoyed the work of the board and appreciate the feedback I have received that community members have seen my approach as organized and thoughtful to the questions and work that comes before the Board for consideration and action. I am proud to have added value in helping to develop and steer the publicly available Data Dashboard and the process behind it, clearer connections to the business community, and a reinstated CASE Agricultural program at DCTC to ensure that exposure to pathways to success in agriculture remain a viable part of the educational experience for students in our community. One clear goal ahead is the critical work of finding the best next leader of DCPS as part of the superintendent search process that we are currently going through, and I am honored to be helping to lead that process. I would be proud to represent the area of Dorchester County in District 5 that raised me.

    "content": "Two face off for District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education position\n\n May 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 2177\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Dorchester County Board of Education has three position on the ballot this year for Districts 1, 3 and 5. There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 3 will not appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The two candidates for the seat will appear on the ballot for the November general election.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the candidates competing for the District 3 seat to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity.\nChristine LaMonica\nChristine LaMonica is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhy are you running?\nAs a parent and a dedicated member of public safety in Dorchester County, I am motivated to address safety concerns in our schools as well advocate for all students to have access to a quality education. As a community we continue to face evolving challenges, these challenges look different in each district. I am prepared to serve our community's public schools and assist in ensuring that the school districts are responsive to these challenges and receptive to the values and priorities of its community members.\nIn addition, as a prospective board member, it is my desire for our children and educators to be set up for success. I plan to use my commitment to public service and my personal and professional experiences to assist with solutions, ideas, and decisions. I firmly believe it is time for Dorchester County Public Schools to start rising to the top and to exceed expectations.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a prospective member of the Board of Education, I bring a commitment to fostering positive change and ensuring that every student receives the best possible education in a safe environment.\nI bring a true passion for advocacy for our students, families, and educators to ensure that their voices are heard, and their needs are met within our educational system. This will include advocating for resources for all schools regardless of their socioeconomic status or location, as I believe in the power of inclusive education that celebrates diversity and promotes a sense of belonging for every student.\nAs a board member I would promote transparency and collaboration in decision making. I am looking forward to visiting the schools and listening to the needs of each district, I believe that is paramount in understanding the culture of our schools. I recognize that to make progress, the Board functions best when the members work together towards common goals with open communication and respect.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nWe have many important issues, all requiring attention. However, as a parent with children in the school system, and as a public safety professional in Dorchester County, I personally believe we need to start our new school year off creating a safer school environment for everyone. Safe schools foster successful learning. This goes beyond more school resource officers and weapon detection systems. This includes addressing the root cause of violence and insecurity in our community by advocating for safe schools with a holistic approach that addresses social, emotional and environmental factors that impact our students.\nThis issue as well as many others require commitment, collaboration (one of my favorite words) and action to ensure our schools are nurturing and safe environments where our students can thrive for success. We can achieve this with more wraparound services and consistency in planning and implementing.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward? How do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nI am going to combine this question along with the question regarding the Blueprint. Overall, the board and district should work together towards the common goal of student safety, success in learning, and wellness for all students first and foremost, the Blueprint hopefully being a roadmap to help us meet certain objectives.\nAs a candidate and community member I see the Blueprint as a \"challenge,\" and one that has the potential to bring good to our schools, albeit nothing is perfect or easy. As a candidate I think the county and the board are addressing the issues of funding and staffing regarding the requirements of the Blueprint and the future of our education system the best they can right now with the resources available to them. The county and the board are going to have to be creative and resilient with the challenges ahead. We aren't alone or singled out in Dorchester County. Larger counties are facing challenges also. They may have more resources to pull from, but larger populations to serve. We all have our specific barriers to overcome. We see this not only in the education system, but in many public service arenas.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nThese numbers tell me that we have work to do. We need those numbers to rise, not only because they are statistics to boast about, but because we want our young students to do well so they can be successful learners. Our educators and support staff that I personally have worked alongside are giving what they can and then some. There is no simple solution, however this is where I think the Blueprint has some promise to help us navigate through some of these difficulties. It just has pieces and parts that are difficult for Dorchester County to achieve for many reasons.\nThe district has its work cut out for it, and so does the board. But as a community, we also have work to do. It takes a village. We need to come together with transparency and a willingness to listen without any personal agendas. As a candidate, I am ready to work with other board members, community leaders and stakeholders to move us forward.\nSusan Morgan\nSusan Morgan is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Morgan is the current Board of Education vice president.\nWhy are you running?\nDriving change has not been easy. More work is needed to bring about the changes that our children need and deserve. DCPS still faces tremendous challenges.\nDCPS students score next-to-last in the State on every academic measure.\nIncoming students lack social, emotional and academic readiness.\nChronic absenteeism remains a significant impediment to achievement.\nDisruptive behavior too often impedes learning and threatens student and teacher safety.\nBudget reductions will require hard, but informed choices over the next several years.\nWithout a strong, improved school system, our community will never attract the young families and businesses that are that are critical to future success.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nMy top priority going forward is to raise the academic performance of all students in every school, with a particular focus on reading and math. The Board is now monitoring student achievement using structured reports prepared by the DCPS Director of Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessments. As a result, we now have reliable data demonstrating that our students' test scores are improving somewhat is some areas. However, unacceptably large percentages of our students in every grade score below grade level in reading and math. Chronic absenteeism remains a significant impediment to achievement. More effective interventions are needed that dedicate time EVERY DAY to reading and math.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nRaise the academic performance of all students in every school, with a particular focus on reading and math.\nMake kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.\nReduce chronic absenteeism.\nImplement an effective alternative education program to address disruptive behavior at every level.\nRefuse to accept violent behavior by imposing serious and predictable consequences on such behavior.\nIncrease fiscal responsibility and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe Board of Education is directing DCPS to implement the Blueprint requirements within the required timelines. However, sufficient funding to meet these mandated requirements is not being provided by the State of Maryland. Lack of adequate funding will require hard, but informed choices over the next several years. Unless increased funding is provided or implementation deadlines are modified, it may impossible to meet Blueprint requirements going forward.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nImportantly, 42.4% of students enrolled in pre-kindergarten programs demonstrate readiness for kindergarten. Overall Kindergarten readiness has improved with 39% of students demonstrating readiness in Fall of SY2023-2024 (versus 32% in SY2022-2023 and 29% in SY2021-2022) We need to make kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have worked constructively with all individuals and groups who have the success of our students as their goal. For example, Mike Diaz (2023-24 Board President, 2022-23 Vice President) and I (2022-23 President, 2023-24 Vice President) have markedly different political views, but we have worked extremely well together to generate the constructive change needed for our children to succeed. Actions of the Board under our leadership over the past two years have resulted in the following accomplishments:\nStudent Achievement.Progress \u2013 The Board is now monitoring student achievement using structured reports prepared by the DCPS Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessments.

A request for proposals to develop and implement similar on-campus programs at the elementary and middle school levels has been posted.Priority \u2013 Implementation of these intervention programs is critical to ensuring students' academic progress and behavioral control. These programs must be flexible enough to address individual student needs, and must be based on a written Functional Behavioral Assessment, supported by a concrete, individualized Behavioral Intervention Plan.Increased Fiscal Responsibility and Accountability.Progress \u2013 Over the past two years, the Board President and Vice President have initiated increased scrutiny of budget development and detailed justifications of spending requests.

Costs have often been carried over from year-to-year without evaluation.Priority \u2013 The practice of continuing programs without evaluation must stop, and programs that cannot demonstrate effectiveness must be eliminated in favor of programs that can. Budget reductions will require hard, but informed choices going forward.School Safety.Progress \u2013 School safety has been improved demonstrably. We have supplied all of our secondary schools with weapons detection systems and installed fences around many of our schools. In addition, the board now refuses to accept violent behavior and is willing to impose serious and predictable consequences for violent behavior.Priority \u2013 Violent students may be offered appropriate voluntary educational programs outside DCPS, but violence can not be accepted on any DCPS campus. Consequences for violent behavior must continue to be clear and consistently enforced.Website Redesign.Progress \u2013 Comments from users indicated that the previous DCPS website failed to provide important information, was difficult to navigate, and lacked effective mechanisms for getting information out to the community.

There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 5 will appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election in November.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the candidates competing for the District 5 seat to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity.\nChris Wheedleton\nChris Wheedleton is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. He is currently serving as District 5 board member.\nWhy are you running?\nI was honored to be appointed last year by the County Council to represent District 5, based on the experiences and skills that I have built working in education and workforce development innovations across the country over the last several decades. I have enjoyed the process of collaborating with the board and community stakeholders to align our resources and find solutions to improve opportunities and outcomes for our students, educators and schools. I feel like I have added value and see the opportunity to help make further improvements. I would like to continue that work for a full term.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThere are many needs and challenges that we face as a community and school district. Among the most important issues currently is the need to have a clear sense for where we are and where we need to go as a school system, and a consistent culture across the system and in each school for accountability and working together to find the best solutions. The current process for finding the best next leader for DCPS is an important part of that, and the board is starting with direct engagement with the community to get the voice of all stakeholders as part of this process. I believe that having a culture that brings all resources that we have as a collective community to help create the best conditions for our students to find success, is among the most important issues we face right now and into the future.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe board and district leadership established and aligned on a strategic plan last year that lays out clear goals for improvement and growth. Those goals were translated into scorecards and metrics in every area of the strategic plan including academic success, school/family/community partnerships, school safety & climate, high quality workforce and operational efficiency. We have shifted the monthly board meetings to put student outcomes and deliverables in each area at the forefront of what we focus on and post the outcomes on the DCPS website after every meeting to ensure transparency and clarity for all community stakeholders. Continuous improvement in every one of those areas is what the district needs to and is working towards.

That includes how we are working to understand and stay compliant with the guidelines that have been and continue to be laid out from the state, which we are currently doing through our Blueprint coordinator, Dr. Boyd. It also includes sharing with all stakeholders what is working and not working for our District and community. There are multiple elements of Blueprint that need to be refined in order for it to help support the unique needs of Dorchester County. The board and superintendent continue to share those with state and local officials so that they understand, from the educator's perspective, what the implementation looks like on the ground. Working together to understand and try to improve what is needed for our county is important. There are positive aspects that have brought resources in the area of workforce development and career planning for students, as well as areas like early childhood that have yet to be structured in ways that work in Dorchester County.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nThere are so many positive improvements happening across our community, and the collective impact of community partners is starting show real results, in concert with the leadership of DCPS. It is no accident that the timing of these improvements comes in the second year of a 10 year comprehensive plan as part of the Campaign for Grade-Level Reading that was started in Dorchester County by a wide range of community partners. This has included nonprofits, business partners and action agencies including Moving Dorchester Forward, the Health Department, the Chamber of Commerce, the library system, the YMCA, Boys & Girls Clubs and United Way. Much of this was started through the leadership of the John & Janice Wyatt Foundation. DCPS is a key leader in this effort through the Early Childhood Advisory Council. The more that we can bring EVERYONE together in this collective effort, the more we will see continued progress. Learn more at: https://www.dorchestercglr.com/\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have enjoyed the work of the board and appreciate the feedback I have received that community members have seen my approach as organized and thoughtful to the questions and work that comes before the Board for consideration and action. I am proud to have added value in helping to develop and steer the publicly available Data Dashboard and the process behind it, clearer connections to the business community, and a reinstated CASE Agricultural program at DCTC to ensure that exposure to pathways to success in agriculture remain a viable part of the educational experience for students in our community. One clear goal ahead is the critical work of finding the best next leader of DCPS as part of the superintendent search process that we are currently going through, and I am honored to be helping to lead that process. I would be proud to represent the area of Dorchester County in District 5 that raised me. I welcome anyone who wants to learn more to check out my website at: https://skillsgap.org/welcome\nMike Hartford\nMike Hartford is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhy are you running?\nMy main focus is keeping our current schools in place. The last few years have been challenging for the current students, board and parents. We need to be sure parents have a true say in what is happening and a place to have their questions answered. I'm running to bring transparency to the current issues at hand and to keep the parents well informed in not only our district, but our county. Its time the younger generation stands up and starts making the changes they wish to see.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nFirst-hand knowledge from a parent standpoint on current issues. Outside perspective, from not only a parental standpoint, but from a business standpoint. As a small business owner I feel I have the tools necessary to communicate issues effectively and provide reasonable solutions when problems do arise.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe infrastructure of certain schools. We need to explore all options that work for the parents, not just the budget. We have schools that have been standing in low-lying areas creating common problems that if fixed, could potentially save the small communities around them. These communities make our county great, if we remove the school(s), we not only face logistical nightmares for parents, grandparents and siblings. We need reasonable solutions that the parents of the students who attend the schools can come to an agreement on.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nWe need to focus more on our local needs and suggestions, rather than what the state suggests. Our county is run by the students and the parents. The current board needs to be aware of that. It is about the kids, always.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nMaryland's Blueprint itself is a great concept. We need to adapt to these guidelines and utilize the tools and knowledge we have of our local community to expand the idea further. For Instance, teacher incentives, pay raises and teacher appreciation should be at the forefront of our focus. These are the people who guide the students in the right direction. We need to attract the best talent so we can provide the children the best education they can get. Our country's future depends on it.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nWhile trending in the right direction, we need to keep the momentum. Providing parents of toddlers and childcare workers educational supplies and online classes to further their skills could potentially be beneficial. The parents/daycare providers could use these supplies/skills to ensure our young children are mentally, physically and emotionally ready for their big transition. The current pk-3 option we are bringing into the 2024-2025 school year is a great idea, but at what expense?\nJerome Harris\nJerome Harris is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.

Truly it takes a village. I want to be able to recognize the people in the village that helped us do the jobs that we can do. We can't do it alone, isolated, as a school district,\" said TCSP Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi during her opeing remarks. \"We are super excited to shine a light on those community partners that helped us. Each school selects one community partner that has helped them throughout the year. As I like to say it is a handshake, not a handout.\"\nThe TCPS dance program performed by Beyond the Steps stole the show and got big applause for their energetic performance to Pharrell Williams' \"Happy.\" Afterwards, awards were presented to community partners.\nEach school in the district chose one partner to uplift.\nTalbot County Public School District chose the Talbot County Public Library to honor.\n\"We selected them because we always come up with ideas and the people from the library are like sure we will do it. Like for example popsicles in the park. Anything we want to do, they are like, 'Call us and we will help out,'\" Pepukayi said.\nShe also made sure to \"Give a super shout out to the Talbot County Education Foundation. They are the group that supports our teachers in the classroom when they have ideas. They help fund those innovative ideas and projects that teachers want to do.\"\nDr. Lisa Devaric, principal of Easton Elementary School, said, \"We are recognizing Rack Room Shoes. They have a program where people buy shoes and a percentage goes into a shoe fund for our school. We are at about 78% free and reduced meals. So close to eight out of ten of our students are living at or below the line of poverty line.\"\nShe said that community school program manager Katie Fox knows what style, color and size the students need and uses the funds to buy shoes for them.\n\"We want to provide more than academics. We want to improve the quality of life for our students looking at mental health, access to nutritional foods, wraparound care,\" Devaric said.\nDebbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools, introduced the schools and their partners one by one.\nFirst was Kari Clow, principal of Chapel District Elementary School, who chose Second Chance Thrift Shop. Easton Middle School chose Foundation of Hope. Easton High School chose Harbor Freight Tools. St. Michaels Middle High School chose Donnie and Shelley Gowe. St. Michaels Elementary chose the St. Michaels Fire Department.\nTilghman Elementary chose Tilghman Methodist Church. White Marsh Elementary chose Mamma Maria's and the Coffee Trappe. TCPS Internship Program chose iFrog Marketing Solutions. The Early Learning Department and the Judy Center chose Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers.\nThe closing remarks were made by Emily Jackson, president of the Talbot County Board of Education.\n\"I am so blown away by what I have seen today. Our community is truly amazing. Thank you all for everything you do every day. Your unwavering support is the backbone of our schools, and you empower us to create meaningful experiences for our students,\" Jackson said.\nShe thanked the culinary arts students, Linda Brown and Joseph Candel for making breakfast. She also thanked the TCPS Education Foundation for sponsoring the whole event.\n\"It is about recognizing the spirit of collaboration and the unity that defines us as a community. Whether it is volunteering your time, providing resources or lending your expertise each of you and your contributions makes a real difference in the lives of our students,\" Jackson said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We needed a new road to bring a loop around before we could start on the construction,\" Evans said. \"We would like to thank Stacey Seward and Dan Fox, who is not here, from Caroline County to help us get a community development block grant that helped us build this road. Justin Fair was the project manager at the state and Cindy Stone. And then Robyne Chaconas, who is the deputy director the Community Development Administration.\"\nThe excited crowd clapped.\n\"When we talk about this master plan, it didn't only take a village in the beginning to develop the plan. It is going to take a village to bring it to fruition. We are starting to see that by this first step,\" Evans said.\nThen on this windy cloudless day, 10 people joined Evans as he snipped the royal blue ribbon signifying the opening of the road around campus.\nGoing 100 feet and down a hill were five golden shovels by a patch of dirt. In the background was a backhoe and the space where residences will be built.\nBenedictine got $1.8 million in congressional directed funding to support these new spaces for residents who have developmental and intellectual disabilities and autism.\n\"Benedictine is launching its 'Transforming Lives' campaign to address the needs of its student demographic that has significantly changed since the existing residential spaces were built,\" a press release from Benedictine said. \"Over 80% of the student population that Benedictine now supports is living with more complicated forms of autism. The new residential wings will include suites equipped with multiple recreational and sensory areas, along with an updated dining area and state-of-the-art infirmary.\"\nEvans spoke while those assembled grabbed golden shovels.\n\"Where we stand now and what is behind me is the old convent for the sisters. As you know, our campus operates 24/7, 365. When we started this, one of the biggest obstacles was how are we going to update our facilities and not hamper what we do on a daily basis serving the students,\" Evans said.\n\"We could refine and develop a space that really does meet the needs of the student profile that we serve today. That is what is most important. The next is how do we pay for it?\"\nFunding for the school comes primarily from the state, Evans said.\n\"A lot of people stepped up beginning with Gov. Hogan's office and then Gov. Moore's office giving us capital. And then our entire congressional delegation, including Sens. Van Hollen and Cardin, Rep. Andy Harris,\" he said.\nThere was even more local delegation support that included state legislators \u2014 Sen. Stephen Hershey and Sen. Johnny Mautz, Del. Jeff Ghrist, Del. Chris Adams, Del. Steven Arentz and Del. Jay Jacobs, Evans said.\n\"They really went to bat for us with bond bill money and capital monies at the state. Because of our advocates in Annapolis, we were able to get $1.25 million in capital, which is huge,\" he said.\nBenedictine will start building the new facility in a few weeks. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There are currently six candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Talbot Public Schools.Candidates in District 2 will appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election. The Districts 5 and 6 candidates will not be on the ballot until November, since no more than two candidates are registered in those races.\nEach position will serve a four-year term beginning in Dec. 1, 2024, and ending in Dec.1, 2028.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the eight candidates competing for the seats to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity and length. Extended versions of the candidates' Q&As can be found at stardem.com.\nCANDACE HENRY\nCandace Henry is running for the District 2 Board of Education seat. She is currently on the Board of Education.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nSeveral very important issues face Talbot County Public Schools. One key issue is the recruitment and retention of diverse teachers and administrators.\nAs a board, we should continue and enhance our efforts to create a welcoming and supportive work environment, offer competitive compensation, increase opportunities for high-quality professional development, prioritize work-life balance, and recognize the value of all educators.\nAnother important issue is the opportunity gap. To address the opportunity gap, it is important to continue our multi-faceted approach to advancing equity throughout TCPS. Examples include resource allocation, targeted support for underserved communities, access to challenging courses for all students, data-informed decision-making, community engagement, and recruiting diverse educators.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe implementation of the Blueprint involves careful planning, collaboration with stakeholders, and a focus on equity. Additionally, TCPS leadership should continue efforts to regularly communicate with our local community and stakeholders on the progress and updates related to implementation planning.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nEach year, the board and district meet to identify and align our goals with the district's strategic planning initiatives. The board and district should continue to work toward several overarching goals to effectively improve educational experiences and outcomes for all students.\nWe should continue to ensure that all students have equitable access to high-quality education, regardless of their background, socioeconomic status, race, or ability. This includes addressing disparities in resources, opportunities, and outcomes among student populations.\nThe board and district should continue to set ambitious goals that focus on improving student achievement, closing achievement gaps, increasing proficiency levels in core subjects, and preparing students for post-secondary education and/or career success.\nWhy are you running?\nI currently serve on the TCPS School Board, a position I've been proud to hold for the last 4 years. I am inspired by my personal experiences as a student in Talbot County Public Schools and am a proud alumna of Easton High School.\nI am also a mother of two TCPS students. My grandmother's legacy as a TCPS educator has instilled in me a profound passion for education, which has fueled my dedication to serving on the Board of Education.\nI witnessed my grandmother go above and beyond for her students and work tirelessly in our community to help others. Her work inspired and shaped the mother, advocate, wife, community leader, and professional that I am today.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nI bring over 20 years of advocacy experience and a deep commitment to public education to the Board of Education.\nRegarding my professional background, I am currently the director of the Disability Resource Center at Salisbury University, where I am responsible for the oversight and coordination of all operational, administrative, budgetary, personnel, outreach, and assessment activities for students with disabilities.\nAdditionally, I am an adjunct professor in the College of Health and Human Services, where I co-developed and teach in the university's first disability studies minor.\nData is showing a lack of kindergarten preparedness since the pandemic. What do you feel needs to be done to help young students catch up to pre-pandemic numbers?\nTCPS's commitment to engaging families as partners in their children's education has been critical to the goal of improving kindergarten preparedness. I am in support of expanding access to high-quality early childhood education programs, including pre-kindergarten and Head Start programs, especially for children from historically-excluded backgrounds.\nThese programs can provide a strong foundation for academic and social-emotional development before kindergarten. Additionally, extended learning opportunities, such as summer and afterschool programs, can also provide complimentary academic support and enrichment experiences for young students.\nWe should also continue to establish systems for ongoing data monitoring and assessment to track students' progress in kindergarten preparedness and adjust strategies as needed. Using data to identify areas of improvement and allocate resources strategically to support student success.\nOver the past decade, Talbot County elementary schools have seen a rise in Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language. What would you suggest or hope to do to better accommodate these students?\nI support TCPS's continued efforts to increase and strengthen support for our Hispanic and ELL students.\nTo better accommodate Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language in Talbot County elementary schools, it's essential to implement strategies that foster a supportive and inclusive learning environment while addressing student needs.\nSuch strategies include establishing strong partnerships with Hispanic families and community organizations, increasing outreach initiatives, incorporating culturally responsive teaching practices, and expanding support services to include topics related to academic support, cultural integration, and navigating the school system.\nCYNTHIA JURRIUS\nCynthia Jurrius is running for the District 6 Board of Education seat.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most significant issues facing Talbot County Public Schools are interrelated:\nStudent mastery of essential knowledge and skills.Retention, recruitment, and support of excellent teachers.Positive, safe, effective, inclusive school climate for all learners.Family and student engagement.\nAlthough test scores are not always indicative of a student's mastery of the subject matter, statewide and local assessments indicate that many of our TCPS students are not yet achieving grade level standards in essential subjects.\nOne of the most significant indicators for student success is an effective teacher, and, like the rest of the nation, Talbot faces significant teacher shortages.\nA positive, safe, effective, and inclusive school climate is fundamental for student success, as well as teacher retention. Finding innovative ways to engage families, including non English speakers, and students will support all aspects of student success.\nThe current board and superintendent are making progress toward addressing these issues despite many challenges, such as the learning gap caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through additional instructional support, expanding use of innovative community partnerships, strategic use of technology, targeted allocation of resources, and engaging all sectors of our community, I believe that working together we can accelerate progress in these areas.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling the Blueprint?\nThe board, Superintendent (Sharon) Pepukayi and team have a detailed plan for managing the Blueprint. I commend the transparency with which they are approaching this massive undertaking, providing regular reports on Blueprint progress for public review.\nThere are areas of the Blueprint that Talbot was already doing well and new areas that are now required to be addressed. There are many aspects of the Blueprint that are positive. However, the most challenging aspects of the Blueprint in Talbot are state mandates without sufficient funding.\nI would support continued efforts to address the state funding formula as it has been applied to Talbot County.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nAs stated in the TCPS FY 23 Annual Report, the board and superintendent have identified the following goals:\n\"Academic Equity and Achievement; increasing student mastery of grade level/course mathematics standards as measured by local assessments and MCAP measures.\nFostering an Engaging Environment; create and maintain a supportive environment that engages all students and staff.\nHiring and Retaining Highly Qualified and Diverse Staff. Recruit, hire, retain, and promote highly qualified and diverse staff.\"\nI support these goals \u2014 innovative, collaborative solutions are needed to accomplish the goals.\nWhy are you running?\nOur public schools play a pivotal role in shaping our community's future, and we need community members on our board who can help move Talbot County Public Schools forward to excellence.\nI serve to make a difference, I care about kids, and I have skills and experience to contribute. I would listen to all perspectives and value the richness in diversity of opinion.\nI am a natural collaborator, skilled at helping people work together to find solutions to challenging community problems. I am also willing to speak up and ask tough questions when necessary.\nI want to ensure that our Talbot Board of Education continues to function effectively and that the polarization that has infected many school districts stays out of our community. We have many strengths on which to build, and together we can solve any challenge.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a seasoned community leader and mediator, I am committed to fostering an inclusive environment where all perspectives are heard, valued, and considered.\nThrough my community involvement; career as an attorney, community mediator, former director of a local nonprofit; and in my current role, I have honed the skills necessary to navigate complex community challenges.\nAs director of youth and family services for Mid Shore Community Mediation, and later as executive director, I launched the implementation of school-based programs focused on conflict resolution, leveraging limited resources for successful outcomes for students.\nI thrive on the challenge of collaborating with diverse stakeholders to uncover innovative solutions that benefit all parties involved. As the parent of three TCPS graduates, I understand the importance of advocating for policies and initiatives that prioritize the well-being and academic success of every student.\nAs a family member of educators and school administrators, I bring a multifaceted understanding of the educational landscape. We have many good things to celebrate in the Talbot County Public Schools \u2014 a great foundation of caring and skilled teachers, experienced administrators, an effective Board, and fantastic kids.\nI am dedicated to listening, collaborating, and working hard to ensure that our schools continue to evolve and thrive for the benefit of our entire community.\nData is showing a lack of kindergarten preparedness since the pandemic. What do you feel needs to be done to help young students catch up to pre-pandemic numbers?\nTCPS is currently implementing aspects of the Blueprint that provide for expanded pre-K, to support improved kindergarten readiness in the future.\nAdditionally, these students are now moving through the elementary grades, and students at other grade levels also have a pandemic learning gap. The existence of the gap needs to be recognized and addressed at all grade levels.\nAt the elementary, middle school, and high school levels, additional math coaches, use of differentiated self-paced technology, and additional instructional aides could be beneficial, including bi-lingual math and language coaches.\nIt is essential to meet students where they are, so that students who need support are not left behind, and those who are ready to excel have that opportunity.\nOver the past decade, Talbot County elementary schools have seen a rise in Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language. What would you suggest or hope to do to better accommodate these students?\nProviding an inclusive environment that supports all learners is important at all grade levels, and students who are not yet proficient in English come into TCPS at all grade levels.\nIt is essential for students at all grade levels to receive support to achieve English language proficiency, as well as support in other subject areas. The types of support for young learners, who are emerging readers, may differ from those for older students.\nThere is considerable research available about working with emerging language learners at all grade levels, and as a Board member, I would look for the best evidenced-based approaches.\nIn addition to providing additional bi-lingual instructional aides in classrooms, math and language coaching, and other direct supports for ESOL students, working with community organizations and community partners to engage these students and their families could be beneficial.\nANNA HOWIE\nAnna Howie is running for the District 5 Board of Education seat. She currently serves on the Talbot County Board of Education.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now is providing exceptional education opportunities for all students while being fiscally responsible.\nCurrently, the curriculum coordinating committee has brought high quality resources to the board for approval in the areas of reading and mathematics. These resources are paid for through educational grants.\nUtilizing grants is a responsible way of ensuring that we are providing our students with high quality instructional materials while being fiscally responsible.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future is designed to improve the quality of education for all children in Maryland and is law. We must ensure that our plan is attainable to meet the goals of the five pillars.\nTalbot County Public Schools and the Board of Education worked in collaboration to create three goals to serve serve serve as the priorities for this school year.\nThe goals include ensuring that we recruit and retain a high quality and diverse staff, increase and improve our mathematics Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program (MCAP) scores, and ensure that our schools are safe. These goals directly align with the pillars of the Blueprint.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nTalbot County Public Schools and the Board have been working toward three goals which are recruiting and retaining a high quality and diverse staff, increasing and improving our mathematics MCAP scores, and ensuring that our schools are safe.\nTCPS and the Board of Education are on target with the three identified goals that we are working towards that align with the needs of the school system, as identified through stakeholder surveys, as well as the Blueprint. TCPS will continue to work collaboratively with stakeholders to continuously improve and meet the needs of our community.\nWhy are you running?\nI am running for a position on the Talbot County Board of Education because not only am I a product of public-school education, I come from a long line of educators and education is my passion.\nMy grandfather was the industrial arts teacher at Moton High School and Easton High School. My mother was a teacher at Easton Middle School, as well as an elementary school teacher in Michigan and Florida.\nMy husband has worked as a special education teacher, assistant principal, principal (Easton High School), and now currently services as the director of student services in Dorchester County. My daughter is a fifth-grade elementary school teacher.\nEducation is extremely important to me and my family, and we have made it our mission to ensure that all students receive a high-quality education.\nStudents deserve to learn in a safe and nurturing environment that allows them to discover their strengths and develop skills that will ensure that they grow to be lifelong learners and productive citizens.\nAs a board member, I want to ensure that our students are safe, healthy and successful. Teachers should be compensated at a wage that respects their professional position and levels of education.\nCommunity stakeholders should be reassured that the students from our school system are provided with the best education and are college and career ready when they graduate from high school. As a member of the board, I will make it my job to do what is necessary for all of our students to succeed.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nI bring to the Talbot County board more than 20 years of public-school experience.\nMy career in education has progressed from being a teacher to an instructional mathematics coach, human resource administrator, local accountability coordinator, curriculum supervisor for mathematics and career and technical education, and a principal.\nI have learned so much from the various roles that I have had the privilege of working in over the years. I work collaboratively with my colleagues, and the Board of Education is a team that works collaboratively to ensure that we achieve our educational goals.\nI bring respect, leadership and the ability to listen which are all essential to ensuring that our collaboration is productive for our students' success.\nData is showing a lack of kindergarten preparedness since the pandemic. What do you feel needs to be done to help young students catch up to pre pandemic numbers?\nKindergarten preparedness is important, and by providing pre-K to our students, Talbot County Public Schools is taking the initiative to ensure that our students are ready for kindergarten. I will make sure that we are working to start our students on the right path to academic achievement.\nOver the past decade, Talbot County elementary schools have seen a rise in Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language. What would you suggest or hope to do to better accommodate these students?\nTalbot County Public Schools welcomes all students and now that we are seeing a rise in our Hispanic student population, we are ensuring that we have the appropriate staffing to accommodate our students.\nThis includes making sure that we have the appropriate number of English language teachers and instructional assistants in our schools.\nThe funding formula that has been the guiding principle in our budget mandates that resources are aligned to each school's need.\nThis includes ensuring that funding is available for all students identified within specific student populations. I will work to ensure that all students receive the education and accommodations that they need to succeed.\nOTHER CANDIDATES\nKerry Gunshenan, District 6, is also running for a position on the Board of Education. Reporters reached out and received no response from Gunshenan.\nKarla Wieland-Cherry, District 5, is running for a position on the Board of Education.

    "title": "Moms For Liberty Fields Candidates in Elections",
    "date": "2024-05-05",
    "author": "Jim Johnson",
    "content": "Moms For Liberty fields candidates in elections\n\n May 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM JOHNSON | Section: Columns \n \n 1066\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Voters need to know that three candidates for the Talbot County Board of Education are backed by Moms For Liberty, a group that has raised questions across the country and stirred controversy with its views.I don't think it was a coincidence that none of the three candidates \u2014 Ann C. O'Connor in District 2, Karla Wieland-Cherry in District 5 and Kerry Gunshenan in District 6 \u2014 submitted a questionnaire the Star Democrat sent to candidates seeking their opinions on why they are running for the Board of Education and their stances on various issues.\nOther candidates in the race submitted the questionnaires and their answers were published in the newspaper this week. This is a common practice in elections to give voters insight into how to cast their ballot.\nThe Associated Press, in a July 2023 story, described Moms For Liberty as a \"parental rights\" group that has sought to take over school boards in multiple states.\nThe group has been accused of harassing community members, advancing anti-LGBTQ+ misinformation and fighting to scrub diverse and inclusive material from lesson plans, according to the AP story.\nMoms for Liberty advocates for various conservative causes in education, such as opposing critical race theory and advocating for school choice. They often mobilize parents to attend school board meetings, petition policymakers, and advocate for changes in curriculum and policies.\nWhether Moms for Liberty poses a threat is a matter of perspective.\nSupporters argue that they are exercising their democratic rights to advocate for their beliefs and values, particularly in education, where they feel their voices have been marginalized.\nCritics raise concerns about the group's impact on public education, the potential for polarization within communities, and whether their advocacy could lead to the undermining of public institutions and democratic processes.\n\"'Parental rights' is an appealing term, but voters have caught on to the reality that it is fueling book bans, anti-LGBT efforts, pressure on teachers not to discuss race and gender, whitewashing history, and so on,\" said political analyst Larry Sabato, a politics professor at the University of Virginia and founder and director of the Center for Politics, who was quoted in a November Washington Post article. \"Parents may want more input in the schools, but as a group they certainly aren't as extreme as many in the Moms for Liberty.\"\nHere in Talbot County, I wish the local candidates had taken the time to write about their stances on issues. There is no doubt that there will be voters in Talbot County who agree with them. In some districts, that may be a majority. Yet few people know what these candidates stand for.\nThe fortunate thing: Due to only two candidates running in each district, all of these candidates will be on the ballot again in November. Only District 2 will be on the May 14 primary ballot. In that district, three candidates will be listed, but Connie Loveland said that she has withdrawn from the race, albeit too late to have her name removed from the ballot.\nThe November election will give these candidates another opportunity to tell voters what they stand for. I hope they take it. Before voters cast their ballots, they deserve to know where candidates stand.\nTalbot County this week celebrated the businesses that keep our region's economy thriving. It was an inspirational event.\n\"Our goal is to connect the business community with resources that will help them succeed and grow, and to tell the stories of business leaders who are doing extraordinary things,\" said Cassandra Vanhooser, director of Talbot County's Department of Economic Development and Tourism.\nBefore the awards, Chris Pilkerton, former acting administrator and general legal counsel for the U.S. Small Business Administration, talked about the value of small businesses in the county. He should know. His wife, Amanda Cook, owns the Tilghman Island Baking Company in Tilghman where the couple live.\n\"Talbot County's small business community actively seeks out ways to work together to support each other and their businesses,\" Pilkerton said. \"That type of environment creates real opportunities for new and existing companies.\"\nHe praised the county's economic development efforts.\n\"I have had the opportunity to travel through many states and counties throughout the country and meet directly with local economic development officials,\" he said. \"In my experience, the team within Talbot County is uniquely supportive of their small businesses and is accessible to help with so many topics as they come up.\"\nPilkerton is right. The team led by Cassandra Vanhooser continues to provide much needed support for businesses both small and large in Talbot County. We are lucky to have such talent here.\nA Washington Post story this week showed alarming data for the Eastern Shore, sea levels are rising quickly along the Gulf coast and Atlantic seaboard. The story documented the change in coastal sea levels between 2010 and 2023, in some cases more than 8 inches in the past 14 years.\n\"Since 2010, it's very abnormal and unprecedented,\" said Jianjun Yin, a climate scientist at the University of Arizona who has studied the changes. While it is possible the swift rate of sea level rise could eventually taper, the higher water that has already arrived in recent years is here to stay.\n\"It's irreversible,\" he said in the story.\nThe study included Cambridge, which has seen a 2.8-inch sea level rise since 2010. That was the only Eastern Shore community listed in the story.\nThis increase should not be a surprise to people in the area. A friend with a home on the Choptank River in Cambridge has pumped out his basement multiple times this year, not due to heavy rains but because of high tides.\nJust over a week ago, Oxford announced a pair of federal grants to address the rising sea levels. One grant of $2.6 million is to raise 14 Oxford homes. Residents in those homes agreed to covering 10% of the cost for their home to be elevated. The other 90% of the cost will be paid by the federal government. Lewis said one of those 14 homes is currently being elevated.\nCommission President Tom Costigan turned to the residents in the room, \"I hope you all appreciate just how gigantic this is.\"\nMany towns on the Eastern Shore are taking steps to deal with this problem. As shown by the sea level increases reported in this week's Washington Post story, there is no time to waste.\nJim Johnson is the Star Democrat executive editor.

    "content": "Elkton teacher has green thumb for growing students' knowledge\n\n May 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 1138\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ELKTON \u2014 Most people make the same wrong assumption about Brittany Rigdon.\"No, I did not grow up on a farm,\" Rigdon said with a chuckle, before noting, \"But a lot of people think that I did.\"\nThe mistake is understandable, though, given that Rigdon has been a high school agriculture/horticulture teacher for the past 16 years \u2014 the last seven of which in the Cecil County Public Schools system \u2014 and that her classroom is a greenhouse.\nBut the reason for the common misconception goes well beyond the basic fact that Rigdon teaches horticulture at the Cecil County School of Technology. For anyone who has interacted with her, the confusion has a lot to do with Rigdon's vast knowledge of horticulture and all subjects related to it.\nPerhaps the biggest reason people mistakenly believe that she has worked on a family farm since childhood, however, is this: Ridgon exudes a green-thumb passion for horticulture and for effectively teaching the subject to her students.\nAnd those are some of the reasons why Rigdon is the 2024 Cecil County Teacher of the Year, a distinction that CCPS officials announced last month during a gala at The Wellwood restaurant in Charlestown.\n'ON OUR LEVEL'\"She does way more than just being a teacher,\" said 18-year-old Colin Schmoker, a Rising Sun High School senior who is one of Ridgon's 18 students in the two-year horticulture program. \"Because of our plant sales, the goals that she sets for herself and for us helps us, as individuals, set our own goals for school, for work and for life in general.\"\nSchmoker was referring to how Rigdon uses a practical-application approach inside her main classroom \u2014 a 90'-by-30' greenhouse where, under her guidance, students grow 1,200 poinsettias during the fall semester and then thousands of colorful flowers during the spring semester.\nWith all of the proceeds redirected into the school's horticulture program, Ridgon and her students sell the poinsettias at Christmastime and then, during this time of the year, they sell spring flowers, including ones that have been arranged into prom corsages.\nRigdon's students will be selling class-grown flowers to the public between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Saturday (May 4) during the annual Cecil County School of Technology Spring Showcase on the CCST campus at 912 Appleton Rd., northeast of Elkton.\nDuring the process of preparing for the sales of poinsettias and spring flowers, Ridgon teaches her students about the business side, including pricing to turn a profit.\nRigdon provides her students with much more than backyard-garden skills and techniques for growing plants because this is, after all, a high school horticultural science class taught by a woman who presumably grew up on a farm.\nHer students know how to take soil and texture samples, with the knowledge of which readings are desirable and undesirable and \u2014 just as importantly \u2014 why. They know how to operate tractors and other landscaping machines.\nRigdon's students also know which pesticides to use, when to use them and how to apply them. Along those lines, all of the seniors in Rigdon's class recently passed a Maryland Department of Agriculture pesticide application class and, as a result, they are legally permitted to spray higher-dose pesticides that are unavailable to the general public. The pesticide-applications certification enables her students to earn a higher wage on landscaping jobs than the pay for uncertified employees.\nIn addition, her students know how to identify scores of plants. One of her students recently passed an academically rigorous exam given by the Maryland Nursery Landscape Greenhouse Association (MNLGA) in which, as part of it, test takers must identify 240 types of plants.\nThree of her students fell short by a half point and will retake the exam next week. The MNLGA test has a 33 percent pass rate and, for those who do make the grade, they are certified professional horticulturalists, which can lead to good-paying jobs and also waivers from certain college classes. Under the MNLGA umbrella are numerous prestige gardens in the area, including Longwood Gardens.\nThere is much to learn in the CCST horticulture program and, according to her students, Rigdon is quite natural at imparting her wealth of knowledge to them.\n\"She likes to get on our level. She has a way of making us understand,\" said Belle Granger, 17, a Rising Sun High School senior.\nJoel George, an 18-year-old North East High School senior, echoed Belle.\n\"She has a great knowledge about her subject and makes it understandable for every student,\" George said, adding that Rigdon is known to work right alongside her students. \"She doesn't just show up. She helps us.\"\nIt's noteworthy that Schmoker complimented Rigdon's character, too, as did other students. \"She is a kind person,\" Schmoker said. \"She is very well-respected and she treats everyone with respect.\"\n'KIDS LIKE MYSELF'A Wilmington, Del. native who grew up in a suburban neighborhood, Rigdon took classes in the agriculture program at Thomas McKean High School in Hockessin, Del. because she considered pursuing a career as a veterinarian.\nWhile serving as a student aide for her agriculture teacher during her senior year, however, Ridgon made a realization that put her own a different career path.\n\"A lightbulb turned on. I decided that I wanted to teach kids \u2014 like myself \u2014 that you don't have to grow up on a farm to have a career in agriculture,\" Rigdon said.\nSo, after graduating from Thomas McKean High School in 2004, Rigdon selected her courses accordingly while attending Delaware Valley University in Doylestown, Pa. And in 2008, she graduated from that college with a B.S. Degree in secondary education and agriculture.\nAfter her college graduation and before starting her teaching career, Rigdon served a summer internship at Winerthur Museum, Garden and Library in Delaware. \"I lived on the property and I learned to love plants,\" Rigdon remarked.\nStudents in Rigdon's two-year horticulture program gain the knowledge and experience to work in landscaping, at greenhouses, in florists shops and on farms. Related jobs also can be found in the government sector. In addition, they can go to college and pursue advanced degrees in horticulture.\nIn her Teacher of the Year essay, Rigdon cited a famous quote and then put her own spin on it, taking the liberty to creatively express her belief that each student needs the attention and care of a teacher to flourish.\n\"I wrote, 'To plant a seed is to believe in the future',\" Rigdon said. \"Then I wrote that you have to have more than a belief system to grow a garden. You have to tend to the crops \u2014 and every student has his or her own needs.\"\nAlthough she didn't grow up on one, it's noteworthy that Ridgon now lives on a 20-acre farm in Conowingo with her husband, George Rigdon, and that she tends to flower beds there and other chores that come with the bucolic territory.\n\"I married a farm guy,\" Rigdon laughed. \"We have tractors, chickens, hay, pumpkins, raspberries . . .\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Will plan for better pay ease teacher shortage?\n\n May 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AIDAN HUGHES and DARANEE BALACHANDAR Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 911\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fifth-grade teacher Melissa Carpenter works a 10-hour day on average during the week, and her job sometimes requires her to put in hours on weekends, too.\"I feel like teaching is one of those jobs where we go to work to do more work \u2014 to do work after work,\" said Carpenter, who teaches at William B. Wade Elementary School in Waldorf in Charles County.\nCarpenter's long hours are far from unique among Maryland's educators, as the state and nation grapple with a teacher shortage.\nThe U.S. Department of Education keeps a Teacher Shortage Areas database \u2014 and it found that for the current school year, Maryland was short of teachers in 28 subjects, which the state defines as \"areas of certification.\" That's up from 17 five years earlier. Some teacher certification areas \u2014 such as English as a second language, health science and special education \u2014 are short on teachers from pre-K through the 12th grade.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future \u2013 a landmark state law reforming public education \u2014 aims to fix that problem by \"elevating the stature of the teaching profession\" through higher pay, better training and stronger recruitment efforts.\nHowever, experts and educators have mixed views about whether that will successfully address the root causes of the shortage.\n\"Money is a huge help, but it's not everything,\" said Simon Birenbaum, director of grading, assessment and scheduling at Baltimore City Public Schools. \"Human capital is the biggest issue, and money can help with that problem, but recruiting, training and retaining high-quality teachers and staff has to be the primary focus. No amount of money can compensate for a lack of highly-skilled educators.\"\nDOCUMENTING THE SHORTAGE\nMaryland's teacher woes follow national trends. The National Center for Education Statistics reported 86% of U.S. K-12 public schools faced challenges in hiring teachers for the current school year.\nAmid the shortage, the Blueprint calls for hiring an unspecified number of additional teachers to ease the workload of classroom veterans.\n\"You hear a lot about the teacher shortage \u2014 and how are we going to implement all these Blueprint programs, which require additional staffing, when we have a teacher shortage?\" asked Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\nShortages stem, in part, from the fact that teachers are leaving the profession. In Prince George's County, 1,126 teachers resigned between July 2022 and July 2023 \u2014 up from 989 the previous year, The Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, 625 resigned in Montgomery County Public Schools, up from 576 a year earlier.\nDorchester County experienced the highest attrition rate in Maryland during the 2021-22 school year at 18%, according to a Department of Education report.\n\"I used to never have people just quit in the middle of the year,\" said Dorchester County Superintendent Dave Bromwell, who recently retired. \"The pandemic told some people, you know what? If you're not happy, move on.\"\nAll those factors end up impacting teachers like Carpenter. She said her grade level saw an influx of students, with around 30 students in her own fifth grade class this year.\n\"Our class sizes are growing, and we don't have the support in place to help some of our struggling learners,\" she said.\nBLUEPRINT PAY BUMP\nIn order to address the teacher shortage, the Blueprint provides a number of measures that lawmakers hope will encourage people to become teachers and ensure that existing ones don't leave for more lucrative out-of-state positions \u2013 or exit the profession altogether.\nA key Blueprint initiative increases teacher pay to a minimum of $60,000 by 2026. In some counties, that means a nearly $15,000 pay bump for new teachers.\nDavid Larner, chief human resource and professional development officer at the Howard County Public School System, said the pay raise will attract teachers from other states and build up Maryland's teacher workforce.\n\"If our salaries are higher than salaries in surrounding states \u2026 then candidates are more likely to come,\" Larner said.\nHowever, Hansen, of the Brookings Institution, expressed skepticism about the likely impact of the measure on the state's teacher shortage.\nHansen argued that rather than a universal rise in minimum salary levels, money should be targeted where it's needed the most \u2013 attracting teacher talent in high-need schools and specialized fields like STEM subjects and special education. He also highlighted research that suggests salary is just one of many factors that can lead to teacher attrition.\n\"I think we need to be paying teachers more \u2013 I don't think paying a $60,000 minimum wage is the way to do it,\" he said.\nWORK IN PROGRESS\nBeyond the Blueprint, the General Assembly last year passed the Maryland Educator Shortage Reduction Act, which requires the state to set recruitment goals for teacher education programs, creates an alternative teacher prep program for early childhood educators and establishes a $20,000 yearly stipend for eligible student teachers.\nGov. Wes Moore, who proposed the legislation, said upon signing it that it is intended to place \"world-class teachers in every classroom.\"\nCarpenter, the Charles County teacher, said future changes may be necessary, too.\n\"We will have new students next year, and they will [have] different needs. So we need to make sure that we are constantly evolving,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Sparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George's County, stressed that reinforcing the teacher workforce is key to the Blueprint's overall success.\n\"It lands in the hands of our educators, and if we don't have educators who are highly qualified or able to do the work, then the Blueprint work would never get accomplished,\" she said.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "School officials: Blueprint money is not enough\n\n May 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: OLIVIA BORGULA and OLIVIA YASHAROFF Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1614\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n You might think spending $16.6 billion more in state funds from 2024 through 2029 \u2014 and billions more after that \u2014 would be enough to give Maryland a world-class education system. But that's not what many people at the state's local school districts think.For proof, look at what local district leaders said in March when they updated state officials on efforts to implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's landmark effort to rebuild its public schools.\n\"The funding provided under the Blueprint is not sufficient to meet all of the requirements,\" officials in the Baltimore City Public School System wrote.\n\"Blueprint funding tied to specific programs for expansion requires the elimination of other programs and supports,\" the St. Mary's County Public School System's report said.\nMeanwhile, in Kent County, school officials bemoaned that the district will see increased costs related to staffing, data systems, student support and transportation.\n\"KCPS has found that many of the requirements of the Blueprint come without subsequent funding sources to sufficiently cover full implementation,\" district officials wrote.\nCreated by legislation passed by the General Assembly in 2021, the Blueprint is built on five pillars: expanding pre-K to all 4-year-olds and low-income 3-year-olds, improving the teacher workforce, changing curriculums statewide to prepare students for college and careers, expanding funding and setting up a state agency to oversee it all.\nBut in those March updates, 15 of the state's 24 school districts listed funding or resource allocations among the three central challenges they face under the Blueprint.\nMeanwhile, some county officials \u2014 such as Harford County Executive Bob Cassilly \u2014 say the Blueprint is unaffordable.\n\"Unrealistic state spending mandates for the Blueprint for Education are straining local budgets statewide and should be paused and revisited,\" Cassilly said as he unveiled the county's latest budget April 15.\nNEW MANDATESWhile dramatically boosting state funding for public education over a decade, the Blueprint asks local school districts \u2014 and taxpayers \u2014 to do their part. And that is causing some concern among the state's school principals, said Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\n\"In education, one thing that sometimes happens is we get unfunded mandates, and unfunded mandates are very challenging,\" Kaufman said at a principals conference late last year.\nCounty leaders find the mandates challenging, too. In a letter to Gov. Wes Moore \u2014 a Democrat and strong supporter of the Blueprint \u2014 the Maryland Association of Counties last November listed a litany of concerns. They said the Blueprint's cost estimates don't take into account the bottom-line local impact of several major spending items, including:\nConstruction costs for additional classrooms needed under the plan's expansion of pre-K.Classroom modifications to accommodate instructional changes called for under the Blueprint plan to expand career and technical education.Additional staffing for special education students and English language learners.The new minimum $60,000 teacher salary starting in 2026 and other efforts to construct a \"career ladder\" for Maryland teachers.\nNoting that local education funding has already reached all-time highs, the Maryland Association of Counties said: \"This record county funding, combined with greater funding requirements mandated by the law, will limit counties' ability to fund competing governmental needs at basic operational levels.\"\nThe Blueprint's burden on local school districts is only beginning to be felt. By 2034, local school districts will be expected to pay $700 million more annually than they would if the Blueprint hadn't been adopted, a 2022 state report projected.\n\"As the Blueprint ramps up and the formulas increase, more and more counties will have to put more funds in because the local share will increase,\" said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board, the statewide agency created to oversee the Blueprint. \"We're just in the early first couple of years of Blueprint implementation. So it's only four or five counties that are required to put in more than they have been. But over time, it will be more than half of them.\"\nTROUBLE IN COUNTIESTo hear county officials tell it, though, the Blueprint's mandates are already leaving them in a pinch.\nWhen the Blueprint began its rollout, Dorchester County saw a $3 million jump in local funding contributions, according to County Council President Lenny Pfeffer.\n\"That $3 million jump was devastating to us,\" Pfeffer said. \"We had to pull from every resource and cut some programs that we wanted to do as far as highway maintenance, bridge maintenance and other things like that.\"\nMeanwhile in Cecil County, a school funding battle tied in part to the Blueprint led to the creation of a Facebook group \u2014 Fund CCPS \u2014 with 6,700 members.\nCecil County Executive Danielle Hornberger, a Republican, has refused to meet the school district's funding request. And last month, Hornberger filed an ethics complaint against Cecil County Schools Superintendent Jeffrey Lawson, accusing him of using public property and funds for political purposes in the budget battle.\n\"CCPS families deserve better,\" Hornberger said.\nThat prompted an angry response from Allison Stoudt, the Rising Sun High School senior who founded the Fund CCPS Facebook group. Noting that the county has funded local schools \"at the legal minimum\" for three years running and that its current budget proposal falls $13 million short of the $17 million in additional local aid the district is seeking, Stoudt called Hornberger's accusation against Lawson \"shameful.\"\nIn Worcester County, the county government has similarly refused to increase school funding above the state requirement minimums, leading to a $9 million cash shortfall that could force the district to trim between 90 and 100 staff positions.\n\"It is WCPS' belief that drastically cutting instructional staff runs contrary to the spirit of the Blueprint's goals of continual improvement and transformation in education,\" district officials said in their March Blueprint update.\nSHIFTING RESOURCESThe Blueprint calls for shifting resources within school districts at the expense of other schools.\nCarroll County Public Schools Superintendent Cynthia McCabe explained the potential ramifications of that change at a public meeting in Sykesville last year.\n\"What I don't want to be is a fearmonger, but I also don't want to get to September of 2024 and have parents calling me saying, 'Why are the class sizes so much bigger in my child's school this year?'\" McCabe said during the presentation.\nThe Blueprint shifts funding to higher-need schools in several ways.\nThe education reform plan provides \"concentration of poverty\" grants to some schools to bolster support for academics, extracurriculars, and mental and physical health. Grants are given to schools based on the number of students receiving free and reduced-price meals. In this fiscal year, 454 schools in Maryland received concentration of poverty grants, with just over one- fourth given to schools in Baltimore City.\n\"Especially the community where I serve within my district, they've benefited greatly from having concentrations of poverty funding,\" said Ashley Moore, principal at the Empowerment Academy, a charter school in Baltimore City.\nIn addition, a new requirement under the Blueprint requires students who qualify for Medicaid to automatically be enrolled in free and reduced-price school meals.\n\"This is an improvement from the standpoint of feeding kids,\" said Christopher Meyer, a research analyst at the Maryland Center on Economic Policy.\nBut shifting resources to the schools that need them leads to ramifications elsewhere.\nIn Baltimore County, for example, average class sizes will go from 25 to 24 in grades 1-3 starting in the fall, but middle school class sizes will grow from 20 to 22 while high school class sizes will increase from 21 to 23.\nAt a February media briefing, Baltimore County Schools Superintendent Myriam Rogers said elementary school class sizes have been reduced under the Blueprint because making sure students can read by third grade \"has been proven time and time again to be an indicator of success.\" In addition, she noted that fifth-graders must pass state tests on reading and math.\nAsked if the larger class sizes in other grades could negatively impact students, Rogers replied: \"No,\" saying district officials were being careful in how they were planning to adjust class sizes.\nBut McCabe, the Carroll County superintendent, reiterated her concern about class-size adjustments called for under the Blueprint.\n\"We are concerned that very large class sizes will be detrimental to student learning,\" McCabe said in an email. \"As we are seeing increased mental health concerns in our student population. It is essential that teachers have a manageable class size in order to meet the varied needs of students.\"\nTHE FUTUREThe Blueprint's long rollout period \u2014 along with the nation's post-pandemic bout with inflation \u2014 could pose other financial concerns to local school districts.\nMapping out the potential district-level impact of the Blueprint in 2022, the Maryland State Department of Legislative Services projected that 15 of the state's 24 school districts would have to increase local funding levels at some point before the Blueprint rollout is complete in 2034.\n\"The impacts are not uniform \u2026 leading several counties to need to make significant increases in their local appropriation to the boards of education in the early years, later years, or both,\" the state report said. \"Other county governments are forecast to spend about the same or slightly more than they would have otherwise.\"\nOf course, inflation could impact those projections. Meyer, the research analyst with the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, noted the Blueprint's cost projections were made before prices skyrocketed at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Actual costs in the economy have gone way up, but the funding amounts that are required under state law haven't,\" Meyer said.\nThat being the case, it's possible that some of the funding requirements in the Blueprint may be changed at some point, either by the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board or the General Assembly.\n\"No law is ever perfect,\" Maryland Education Coalition co-chair Rick Tyler Jr. said. \"We're still early in the process of what is intended to be a 10-year process.\"\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Even if the answer is no, Dr. Toughlove is sure you will enjoy the book \"Aaron Slater, Illustrator\", written by Andrea Beaty and Illustrated by David Roberts. Beaty and Roberts have produced a string of New York Times best-selling books including \"Iggy Peck, Architect\", \"Rosie Revere, Engineer\", \"Ada Twist, Scientist\", and \"Sofia Valdez, Future Prez.\"\nThis enchanting, rhyming tale is about a boy named Aaron who loves to listen to stories and dreams of writing a story someday. But when he goes to school, he struggles to learn to write. \"But the words are just squiggles, and try though he might, even with help Aaron can't get it right. Why can't I do it? Why is it so hard? He goes back to drawing on slate in his yard.\" (p. 8-9).\nAaron's self-confidence is shaken by his inability to excel at reading and writing, and his effervescent personality is transformed into a quiet, inconspicuous young boy. But in grade two, something magical happens. Aaron realizes that although writing and reading aloud is a challenge, his superpower is his ability to capture his thoughts with pictures. \"His art makes the difference. His art leads the way and helps him discover what he wants to say.\" (p. 32).\nSpeaking of pictures, the illustrations in \"Aaron Slater, Illustrator\" emanate joy and beauty and just jump off the page. Dr. Toughlove loves colorful illustrations, and this book does not disappoint. It is no wonder that David Roberts illustrations have received so much acclaim.\nIf children wish to explore art further, \"Aaron Slater's Big Project Book for Astonishing Artists\" provides additional information about how art influences our world and includes follow-up art projects as well. If you go to Andrea Beaty's website (andreabeaty.com) there are downloadable coloring sheets and other goodies available.\nThe rhyming verses in this book are also ideal for emergent readers who are working on learning how to sound out words, which is one of the cornerstones of mastering reading. \"Aaron Slater, Illustrator\" is appropriate for children aged 4-7 and is available at your county library.\nCarol Franks-Randall has a doctorate in education and is a retired educator and children's book author. She lives in Centreville and each month writes children's book reviews as Dr. Toughlove, one of the protagonists in her first book, \"Jamal and Me.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Teachers would spin a wheel, and the number that they get would correlate to a challenge. The challenges included writing a paragraph of praise to a fellow teacher and sending it to the principal to give the message anonymously.\nHaley Wright, a teacher at Maple Elementary, said she had a lot of fun this week. She enjoyed the appreciation she received from staff and the chance to connect with other teachers at the school.\n\"It allows teachers who may not always see each other or maybe they're able to establish new friendships among their staff members. The kids really get into it,\" Wright said. \"On their morning announcements, students asked staff to ask us, 'Did we spin the wheel?' 'What challenge are we going to work on today?' So I think it also allows for the students to get excited about it, too.\"\nNatalie Drake, teacher at Maple Elementary, said she enjoyed the work that the administration put into this week, especially while making it a team activity. Drake described how teachers and support staff were split into teams to earn points to be the winning team at the end of the week.\nBy far, Drake's favorite part was feeling seen by other teachers and staff at the school.\n\"I did receive one of those anonymous emails today, and that really just put a smile on my face,\" Drake said. \"Other people here at school recognize the hard work that we all put in. They're very appreciative of all that we do here. So not just our administration appreciates us, but also our colleagues are appreciative of us.\"\nFor Ford, teachers work hard all year, and with standardized testing, it is easy for everyone to feel a bit burned out this time of the year. These events are meant to refresh everyone and provide a positive outlet for energy for teachers, staff and students.\n\"Teaching is hard. But it's fun, and it's rewarding,\" Ford said. \"I enjoy seeing my teachers in action, their passion, and you can truly tell that they care about all of their students, and it just makes me feel good. It makes me proud to be the principal here and just proud to be able to work with such amazing educators.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I have purposely waited to announce my candidacy because I was curious what type of hate I was going to start to encounter.Well ... the Star Democrat has wasted no time with starting to blatantly attack my character because Moms for Liberty is endorsing me. Jim Johnson (editor) wrote an article (May 5) stating that he \"wished the local candidates had taken the time to write about stances on issues.\" Well, Mr. Johnson, if you remember the phone call I made to you the other day (Wednesday), you would be amiss to remember that I stated that I was still seeking to learn input from parents around the area on their concerns with schools and education, that I was finishing four college courses related to my jobs in nursing and real estate, was focusing on getting my volunteer work aligned and preparing for surgery so I could start campaigning in June. I also told you I had emailed the writer and told her I would be happy to meet with face to face to discuss her questions.\nSo don't start questioning my character, ideologies, or stance on anything just because I didn't feel I was prepared to answer your questions at the time and a group you claim to \"pose a threat\" is giving me support. Maybe you pose a threat more with your own biased hatred and to know you haven't even met me yet.\nSince I posted this on Facebook first, I haven't been let down with the haters. Wow. And they call Moms for Liberty hateful ... go figure!\nKARLA WIELAND-CHERRY\nTrappe \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But the reality is that, at the national level, their party remains the principal roadblock to any meaningful, long-term solutions.To understand all this, it's necessary to consider the broad contours of the crisis. During and following the pandemic, many child care centers closed, and many areas of the country, known as \"child care deserts,\" today have critical shortages of licensed slots for children.\nMeanwhile, thousands of centers remain under-enrolled because operators can't afford to pay early childhood educators competitive wages. At an average hourly rate of $13.71 in 2022, early childhood educators are among the lowest paid workers in the country.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, child care should constitute no more than 7% of a family's income, but costs for a family with two children in care can range anywhere from 10% to 33% of a family's budget, exceeding rental and mortgage costs in many states.\nJust last month, Congress passed, and the president signed, a $1.2 trillion funding bill that included almost $9 billion for child care and $12 billion for Headstart, the early childhood program for low-income families. But even those funds will serve a relatively small fraction of eligible families, and the state-level fixes, helpful as they are, will only go so far.\nRepublicans have resisted more substantive solutions to the child care crisis out of a familiar opposition to many, if not most, forms of social spending \u2014 sometimes labeling them \"socialist,\" other times describing child care itself as disruptive to traditional family roles, that is a mother at home. The net result places the burden of care on individuals and individual families, a proposition that works only for the most affluent.\nThe alternative is to recognize \u2014 as many European countries do \u2014 that high quality care, whether for small children or for the elderly, is a collective responsibility. This idea is the essence of what many call a \"caring society,\" a society that enshrines care as a human right and that values the well-being of all individuals, all families, no matter what their socio-economic status may be.\nBut for millions, the child care crisis remains a troubling problem that won't solve itself. Alternatives beckon; other possibilities for a caring society beckon. Will these inspire action?\nAndrew Moss, syndicated by PeaceVoice, writes on labor, nonviolence, and culture from Los Angeles.

    "content": "Moms For Liberty advocates for school parents\n\n May 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JAN GREENHAWK | Section: Columns \n \n 798\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In his column in the Easton Star Democrat, Sunday, May 5, Executive Editor Jim Johnson wrote an article entitled, \"Moms For Liberty fields candidates in clections.\"I am the current chapter chair for Moms For Liberty Talbot. Mr. Johnson made no attempt to contact me to verify or discuss any of the information contained in his article.\nMoms For Liberty Talbot encourages people to run for school board and other political offices. We feel the more choices people have, the better. Although we didn't \"field\" the candidates mentioned we certainly sent out a call for people to run in the districts that are open for election in 2024. It is a sad situation when a candidate for any position runs unopposed.\nJohnson states, \"Voters need to know that three candidates for the Talbot County Board of Education are backed by Moms For Liberty, a group that has raised questions across the country and stirred controversy with its views.\"\nNeither Moms For Liberty Talbot nor the national organization Moms For Liberty has made an official endorsement or backed any candidates in the Talbot school board races. That doesn't mean we won't support board candidates at a certain point, but we are not at this time. We like to do our research and get to know the candidates first.\nMr. Johnson could have made a simple phone call to me to find out our status on endorsements or backing candidates, but he did not.\nI can't speak for any of the candidates regarding their responses or lack thereof to the Star Democrat \"questionnaire,\" but I will remind Mr. Johnson that since there are not three candidates in either of the districts, there is no meaningful primary in any of them. Therefore, a candidate can wait until closer to the election to share their opinions with any of the many groups that send out questionnaires.\nThe Star Democrat is a newspaper, Mr. Johnson, not an official arbiter of how candidates should conduct their campaign or when they should answer questions from any group in an election year.\nOur local chapter has scheduled and will offer an opportunity to all school board candidates to meet voters and answer questions in a forum in the fall closer to the election. Invitations will be sent to all candidates prior to that event.\nMr. Johnson is wrong in his portrayal of Moms For Liberty. He says we are controversial. I guess when you advocate for parents instead of unions and special interest groups, you are called controversial.\nAs Mr. Johnson picked descriptors of Moms For Liberty, he used biased, disproven allegations from The Associated Press and an extremely liberal politics professor from Virginia. These descriptions don't address the reality that Moms For Liberty supports parental rights which allow parents a seat at the decision-making table for the educational, medical and mental health decisions made regarding their children.\nMoms For Liberty is dedicated to helping all parents be aware of what is happening in the schools so they can assert their rights in the educational decision-making process.\nDid Mr. Johnson ask any local education officials about how we work with them in Talbot County? Doubtful.\nAs the local chair of Moms For Liberty, I meet often with Talbot County officials including Superintendent of Schools Dr. Pepukayi. We discuss the many issues, questions and concerns of parents in the county. It is always a positive dialogue and very beneficial.\nDr. Pepukayi and school board President Emily Jackson attend our member meetings periodically to answer questions and have discussions. Dr. Pepukayi has done so twice; Emily Jackson once. All three of these events were an opportunity to share ideas in a respectful, positive manner. Does Mr. Johnson know we have a good relationship with both and with many people in the local school district?\nWe attend school board meetings so that we know what is going on in our schools. We are often supportive of our school board and have joined with them in the past to oppose state legislation that would diminish their role in local control of the schools.\nFor a candidate to answer questions created arbitrarily by a reporter eight months from the election is counterproductive and, quite frankly, not very smart. Issues can change so much between now and then. Maybe the better question is why the Star Democrat put out the questionnaire so early in the election year especially since there is no real primary in any of the school board races.\nOverall, Mr. Johnson's opinion piece is being used to target a group he doesn't like and to prejudice voters against candidates he doesn't know. He does this with lies, distortions and omissions.\nMaybe he should sit down and talk with the candidates and also our group. Moms For Liberty Talbot will await his call.\nJan Greenhawk is the chapter chair of Moms For Liberty Talbot.

I do not speak for the group in any capacity, only as a member who shares their concerns.\nThe group was formed as a local group during the COVID-19 response, called the Family Advocacy Alliance ... citizens concerned about the nationwide push for masking of our children and the school closure mandates. Later the teaching of critical race theory and gender fluidity became a major concern. The group only later joined the M4L organization.\nMany parents are dismayed that kids are being taught they are either \"oppressors\" or \"oppressed\" depending on their race. They are being told such things as \"boys can have babies\" and that people can actually change their gender ... in school. Trans boys were allowed to compete against girls in sports and use female bathrooms.\nThey are finding books in their children's elementary school libraries with sexually explicit photos of every imaginable sex act. If we want books removed, it is this kind of book to which we are objecting. (Banning books like Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, I find objectionable.)\nSince the school \"report cards\" came out and showed dismal proficiency scores in math and English for all grade levels in Talbot County, a major concern of the group.\nThe Maryland Board of Education Blueprint for the Future (with its mandates regarding some of these issues that are tied to school funding) is another major concern.\nMoms for Liberty of Talbot would like to support Talbot school board candidates who have these issues front and center. People who can think out of the box and find solutions that have been elusive when following the national and state agendas. We want a school board that will demand proficiency at all grade levels.\nI am not aware of any candidates that have been endorsed by Moms for Liberty to date.\nAbove and beyond all else Moms for Liberty stresses parents' rights to have a major voice in their children's education and the major say in their social and sexual upbringing. M4L members believe that schools are there to teach our kids how to think critically, not what to think.\nI suggest that you and your staff do some basic research before printing.\nKENT ROBERTSON\nRoyal Oak \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This trust is founded in my own experiences. Kindly leave our children alone, Moms for Liberty.\nMoms for Liberty is an extremist organization grounded in advocacy for issues that are irrelevant and misplaced in Talbot County. Moms for Liberty advocates against rights for all, complicating issues around equality, ethnicity, advocating for book bans in school, and opposing common sense, scientifically grounded health care policies in schools.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that tracks extremism, has designated them an extremist group. Moms for Liberty is jamming the zone with rhetoric and conspiracy, purposefully misguiding those who listen and downplaying the everyday achievements made by our school system including the successes of our staff and students. They are a growing organization with chapters across the country. Talbot County's chapter chooses to be affiliated with this organization and proudly trumpets that affiliation.\nIt's important to understand the candidates that Moms for Liberty is endorsing in Talbot County, as these candidates will become a mouthpiece of the organization, and continue to propagate anti-education, anti-diversity rhetoric.\nAs the Star Democratic reminded us, candidates recruited and endorsed by Moms for Liberty in Talbot County include:\nAnne O'Conner.Kerry Gunshenan.Karla Wieland Cherry.\nAt best, these candidates are accepting an endorsement from this divisive, extremist organization that has no place in our county, without understanding what that endorsement means. At worst, these candidates subscribe to this unhinged web of lies and will play an active role in their conspiracies.\nEither way, I do not support these candidates, nor should you.\nTOTCH HARTGE\nEaston \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In absolute terms, St. Mary's charges lower tuition than it did in the 2013-2014 academic year \u2014 a difference magnified significantly by inflation over that period of more than 30%, according to a release from the college.\nThe board-approved increase of 3.9% for room and board reflects the increased costs of goods and services as well as an increase in the Maryland minimum wage.\nThe meeting was led for the final time by outgoing Chair Susan L. Dyer, who completed the maximum three-year term. A commercial real estate developer and managing partner in a restaurant in Leonardtown, Dyer has more than 30 years of experience as a recognized leader and expert in information technology strategy, design, development and delivery of large-scale business and scientific systems.\n\"It has been my absolute pleasure to serve as chair of this outstanding board of trustees and our equally amazing faculty and exceptional staff,\" Dyer said. \"Under the tremendous vision and leadership of President Jordan, we have consistently focused on determining the best outcomes for our students, which truly reflects the heart of this institution.\"\nUnder Dyer's leadership, the trustees oversaw significant positive changes, including maintaining the aforementioned tuition freeze and long-range tuition strategy, the approval of new academic majors, the approval of the three-year Rising Tide strategic plan and an upgrade of the college's credit rating, according to the release.\nDyer will be replaced as chair by John Bell, a 1995 graduate of St. Mary's College who is the managing director of Wells Fargo Corporate & Investment Bank. Bell is the first alumnus to chair the board of trustees.\nThe board was informed by Jordan of her decision to retire in June 2025, and of the transition of the college's Taking the LEAD fundraising campaign to a How High Can We Fly phase for its final year after eclipsing its initial goal of $20 million a year ahead of schedule.\n\"Ten years ago, I said 'now is the time'\u2014the time to become a model of what higher education can achieve, the time for us \u2014 the invisible \u2014 to become visible,\" Jordan, who as appointed president of the college in 2014, said. \"I am immensely proud of our shared accomplishments including the increasing diversity of our student body, steady enrollment growth, curricular and co-curricular innovations, the focus on an expanding campus culture where everyone can thrive, and deeper partnerships with the broader community.\"\nThe board also approved the 2024-2025 meeting calendar, the awarding of degrees to the Class of 2024, a new attendance policy, diversity report, state capital budget proposal and its authority and responsibility matrix. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Will Maryland\u2019s Blueprint for education work?\n\n May 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lizzy Alspach and Apurva Mahajan Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1394\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland plans to spend $16.6 billion through 2029, along with billions more after that, to improve its public schools.But will it work?\nState legislators created a seven-member oversight board to ensure it would.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a transformative education law passed in 2021, aims to boost student performance and education quality throughout Maryland schools. It outlines these goals in five pillars: the expansion of prekindergarten, the hiring and retention of high-quality and diverse teachers and leaders, college and career readiness, additional resources, and accountability and governance.\nLawmakers established the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board to monitor the Blueprint's progress. The board oversees funding and initiative implementation while providing guidance to school districts, all with the intention of improving academic performance in Maryland.\n\"I think part of it is just understanding that we can do better, we need to do better and we're going to do better,\" said Rachel Hise, executive director of the accountability board. \"That's the promise of the Blueprint.\"\nSchool leaders across the state tend to agree \u2014 but they said the Blueprint comes with complications that go beyond the financial challenges it poses to the state and its 24 public school districts. Educators said they're concerned about the Blueprint's deadlines, a lack of detailed procedural information and the plan's overall place in the educational system.\n\"Implementing a law as comprehensive as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future is going to be a herculean effort under the best of circumstances,\" Baltimore City Public Schools officials wrote in their May 1 report to the accountability board. \"But combined with the added complexities of pandemic recovery, delays that resulted in extremely limited pre-implementation planning time for districts, and the slow pace of regulations and guidance pertaining to the Blueprint, the challenges are amplified.\"\nAssessing the BlueprintThe Accountability and Implementation Board will oversee the progress of each public school system in implementing Blueprint initiatives.\nThe board is by law required to:\nDevelop a plan to fully implement the Blueprint in public school systems, complete with timelines and deadlines.Monitor the progress school districts and the state are making regarding the Blueprint by reporting annually on 92 data measures, which collect information on student performance, teacher preparation and outcomes backed by Blueprint funding.Determine if changes need to be made to the plan to achieve the plan's original goals.Ensure \"Expert Review Teams\" of teachers, faculty and staff observe schools and understand how to make recommendations about changing how the plan is implemented.Release about a quarter of Blueprint funds each year to school systems that are implementing initiatives properly.Hire an independent contractor to evaluate the Blueprint's success.Ensure school systems demonstrate at least 75% of funding received per student follows the students to their school.\nUnder the law, the accountability board can withhold funding from school systems that fail to implement Blueprint initiatives or show significant student progress.\nThe board holds routine meetings to hear from Marylanders. It also has a series of advisory groups to gather feedback from teachers, parents, students and other stakeholders, according to Laura Stapleton, a board member and chair of the University of Maryland's Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methodology.\n\"There's so many moving parts,\" Stapleton said. \"Many different stakeholders are needed to implement all the various parts of the Blueprint.\"\nStretching deadlinesEvery Maryland public school district is responsible for rolling out Blueprint initiatives and collecting each of the 92 different data measures for the Accountability and Implementation Board to evaluate, Stapleton said.\nBut school district officials said none of that is easy.\n\"With educational reform of this scale, it is difficult to keep up with the constant changes, timelines and work of each pillar,\" Carroll County school district leaders said in their May 1 submission to the accountability board.\nJanine Bacquie, Montgomery County Public Schools' Blueprint implementation coordinator, said her district is straining to properly gather data and implement Blueprint initiatives within allocated deadlines.\n\"We're struggling to get the guidance that we need to do the work that we need to do with a short timeline,\" Bacquie said. \"If we had another year or two, it'd certainly take some of the pressure off.\"\nAll 24 school districts were originally required to submit their final Blueprint implementation plans by March 2024.\nBut because the state provided necessary materials \u2014 such as report templates and expectations \u2014 to districts only two months before the March deadline, the submission schedule was revised.\nThe March deadline was changed so it only had to be a 10-page preliminary report, according to Bacquie. The final report deadline was then pushed back to May 1.\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board is facing a tough deadline, too. According to Stapleton, an independent contractor is set to perform an evaluation of the Blueprint by October.\nBut Stapleton said she hopes the deadline for the evaluation can be pushed back a few years to give the Blueprint's many initiatives more time to lead to change.\nA slow flow of informationMeanwhile, Blueprint information seems to move slowly to and through the state's school districts.\n\"Because the implementation of Blueprint is massive and encompasses the entire district, one of the biggest challenges is communicating with employees the ways in which their work already aligns with the Blueprint,\" Prince George's County school officials said in their March 2024 submission to the accountability board.\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board holds regular meetings on Zoom for anyone to attend. All meetings are held online and published in an online archive for anyone to view.\nBut Javier Valera, a math content specialist at a public middle school in Montgomery County, said he and other teachers have no clue about the depth of information in the Blueprint.\nHe said the state should work harder to keep teachers informed.\nChanges are coming next year, \"and we don't even know anything about it,\" Valera said. \"It is concerning, because we are going to be the ones implementing the plan. \u2026 There should be more transparency and they need to talk with us and let us know what is this about.\"\nSparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George's County, echoed Valera's sentiments about a need for more details about the Blueprint.\n\"There's a lot of information that definitely needs to be clarified,\" Jefferson said. \"I think it needs to be disseminated in a clear, concise manner where of course our principals are able to understand \u2014 and understand the impact that it has for each school.\"\nMembers of the accountability board encourage community members to provide feedback. Principals, parents and teachers are urged to reach out about the Blueprint, Rachel Amstutz, the accountability board's policy director, said at a principals conference late last year.\n\"We need to hear from the local level what's happening and what you need,\" Amstutz said. \"We need to hear from our parents what's working for their kids and what isn't.\"\nLingering concernsImplementing the Blueprint hasn't gone exactly as planned so far. Deadlines for criteria and implementation plans have been extended at least three times. And in district-level Blueprint plans submitted this spring, school officials across the state expressed a variety of concerns.\n\"From funding uncertainties to staffing shortages and delays in receiving critical guidance, the district must navigate various obstacles to ensure the successful execution of Blueprint initiatives,\" Caroline County school officials said in their March submission to the accountability board.\nMeanwhile, school officials in Allegany County said workforce issues make implementing the Blueprint a challenge. \"Sustaining district-level initiatives across all schools is difficult because of staff retirements and turnover rates,\" officials wrote in their May 1 report.\nIn their Blueprint update, St. Mary's County school officials said they are concerned about all the elements of public education the Blueprint ignores. Other crucial parts of the learning experience could see funding cuts as the district strives to meet the Blueprint's mandates, they said.\n\"The ubiquitous challenge inherent in meeting Blueprint goals is in the fact that the Blueprint is silent on supporting all else, i.e., the arts, athletics, enrichment and after-school programming, transportation, facilities, health care, etc.,\" St. Mary's County school officials wrote. \"These elements of school are necessary and imperative in supporting the whole child.\"\nAmid all the concerns, Bacquie, Montgomery County's Blueprint coordinator, said further delays may be necessary. The rush to complete various measures in the Blueprint could render the plan to reinvent Maryland's public schools less effective than it could otherwise be, she said.\n\"It's not something where you just come in and say something's going to change overnight,\" Bacquie said. \"You're changing hearts, thoughts, minds, strategies.\"\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That doesn't mean, as everybody may think, that we're going to react with violence. We're going to react with education.\"\nAccording to a letter signed by Baltimore's Masjid Ad-Da'wah Ilat Tawheed Imam Raha Batts, the videos shows Gibbs \"being verbally and physically attacked with her hijab being violently snatched from her head.\"\nThe letter says that those involved chanted Islamic phrases to \"taunt\" Gibbs. It also says Gibbs was physically assaulted in the presence of the assailant's father.\nGibbs' mom, LaToya Gibbs, said in an interview May 9 that it's been heartbreaking and devastating to see her daughter go through this.\n\"It's been really hard on her mental health and mine,\" she said.\nShe said Tori Gibbs will be doing home hospital schooling through the end of the year due to her mental health.\nCarter said that when he saw the video, he felt outrage.\n\"Everybody should feel safe,\" he said.\nAt the barbecue, organizers grilled hamburgers and hot dogs and offered pamphlets and books about Islam for people to peruse.\nAlong with offering learning opportunities to people in the community, Carter said they came to help foster a peaceful resolution between the children and parents involved in the incident. He said he was able to help make that happen in the early afternoon before the barbecue began.\n\"We're not protesting or anything like that,\" Carter said about the event. \"But we are calling for change. We're calling for education, and we're calling for change.\"\nThe same day as the barbecue, LaToya Gibbs said she and faith leaders sat down with Dorchester County Public Schools Interim Superintendent Jymil Thompson. Although she said the district had given her \"the runaround\" in the past, she said the meeting was a positive one.\n\"Unfortunately it took for my brothers and sisters to make a post and bring more awareness than I could,\" she said about finally getting that meeting.\nLaToya Gibbs said that at the meeting, she talked to Thompson about how better communication with parents could have stopped the situation from getting as bad as it did.\nAccording to a statement from DCPS, Thompson called the meeting constructive and said the Gibbs family's concerns were taken seriously.\n\"The school and community need to work together to prevent small issues becoming big,\" he said about Imam Raha Batts' suggestion to work together on a bullying awareness program. \"It is sensible to use school, where the community's youngsters come together, to further education against bullying. I look forward to working with the Imam on this project.\"\nIn an email, DCPS Communications and Community Outreach Specialist Valerie Goff said that following the meeting, Thompson will be monitoring the situation and checking in with the family.\nIn an interview May 9, Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd said that on April 5 the department began investigating the incident, which took place outside a Mace's Lane Middle student's home on March 26. He said police did a detailed investigation that included getting video footage of the incident from social media and from city street cameras.\nTodd said Rian Johnson, a parent of one of the children involved in the incident, has been charged with conspiracy of assault in the second degree, conspiracy of reckless endangerment, reckless endangerment and contributing to the condition of a child. He said one of the children involved was identified as a juvenile offender but has not been charged. He said the Dorchester County State's Attorney is looking into whether the offender's actions could be considered a hate crime.\nLaToya Gibbs said the community barbecue resulted in five attendees taking their Shahada, which means they made the decision to convert to Islam. She said two of those five attendees were the fathers of girls in the video that showed Tori Gibbs being attacked.\nTori Gibbs' great aunt, Kandy Waller, said she just wants her niece to be OK. She said the bullying has been a constant, and she hopes the barbecue results in an end to the bullying and harassment.\n\"I just want her to be able to enjoy her childhood like everybody else without the threat of violence,\" Waller said.\nLaToya Gibbs said the barbecue had a positive effect on her Tori.\n\"She did say she was more confident (seeing) all the people come together and show support for her,\" LaToya Gibbs said.\nThis story has been updated to include comments from DCPS. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was in her second year of teaching.\n\"Her loss leaves a big hole in the heart of Sandy Hill Elementary School,\" the letter says.\nCockey \u2014 who also coached the school's cheer team \u2014 was high-energy, friendly and lively, Gibson writes in the letter.\n\"Even if you're child was not a student of Miss Cockey, they will probably know her as she was very engaged with the life of the school,\" Gibbson said.\nBefore coming to Sandy Hill to teach, Cockey interned at Vienna Elementary School during the 2021 to 2022 school year, Dorchester County Public Schools communications and community outreach specialist Valerie Goff said.\nAccording to an email from Maryland State Police, a preliminary investigation found that Cockey \u2014 who was traveling westbound on U.S. Route 50 near Maryland Route 347 in Hebron \u2014 drifted left for unknown reasons and partially entered a left turn lane, striking the rear of a box truck. MSP said Cockey continued to travel through the center median, going west across the eastbound Route 50 lanes and sideswiping a Mazda CX-4 before coming to a stop in a field.\nCockey was pronounced dead on the scene. No other deaths or injuries were reported in the ongoing investigation.\nGoff said that along with notifying the school community of Cockey's death via a letter, Gibson called and spoke with each of the families of Cockey's students.\nOn Thursday morning, students and staff began the day in small classroom circle discussions to share their feelings and offer support.\nGoff said education psychologists, social workers and counselors from other schools were brought to the school, as well as external partners like Mid Shore Mediation, Life's Energy Wellness Center and Mobile Crisis.\nGoff said these extra supports would be available to students and staff on Friday, and from there, the school would \"play it by ear.\"\n\"People are on call, so they'll be coming in on an as-needed basis,\" she said.\nIn the classroom circles, the extra counselors, social workers, psychologists and partners were great in supporting teachers, Goff said. She said some teachers were still in shock about the loss of their colleague.\n\"It was great having that extra support there at the school, both from other schools and from, as I said, our external partners,\" she said.\nTeachers were given resources about grief to use with their students.\nGoff said that students \u2014 particularly fourth and fifth graders \u2014 have started conversations about how the school community can memorialize Cockey.\n\"There are going to be plans about that,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Foremost, salary increases, with the next priority to address health insurance cost increases (approximately 8%), and an increase in utilities; adjusting for what was also an increase in FY24, and subsequently adjusted for in FY25.\n\"It was a very tight and very concerning push and shove\u2026for coming up with the budget,\" Couch said.\nAdding to the challenge, everything is placed in designated line items now, Couch said, referring to the requirements coming from the Accountability and Implementation Board (another component of the Blueprint) that dictates how funds are allocated and prevents the transfer of funds among categories.\n\"Right now we can't see how it's going to work and its going to be very muddy and its going to be devastating I think unless something changes,\" she said, The AIB consultant is very much aware of this problem and can help us try to figure it out.\nOf the proposed budget, \"This is what I believe what we need to operate our school system,\" Couch said. \"If we don't get the money to make this budget, we will need to figure out what we can do without.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester BOE passes emergency virtual education plan with amendment\n\n May 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 647\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 A drafted prolonged state of emergency virtual education plan, now required by the state through a Maryland Senate bill, brought discussion among the Dorchester County Board of Education at a board meeting Thursday.Dorchester County Public Schools' Jodi Colman, the director of curriculum, instruction and assessment, said the drafted plan includes information about staffing, personnel, student instruction and assessment and learning supports in the event of an emergency that is longer than 14 consecutive days. The plan can be amended as needed when entering into a state of emergency, she said.\n\"The purpose of this is in case something like COVID happened,\" she said about the plan.\nColman said the district needs to submit its plan to the Maryland State Department of Education by June 1.\nAfter Colman talked about why the plan is needed, board member Talibah Chikwendu asked why the draft plan requires that content supervisors are invited into Schoology classrooms, a school management system that connects students and teachers online.\nChikwendu said as a teacher, she puts multiple plans in different places and adjusts those plans based on what she's seeing in the classroom and how students are doing. She said she doesn't like the idea of someone else being able to go into the Schoology classroom and possibly move around or delete things.\n\"Especially if I'm going to be held accountable or made responsible for what is in there,\" she said.\nBoard member Sheri Hubbard asked if this is something content supervisors have access to now. Chikwendu said that they did not currently have that access and that it needs to be given upon request.\n\"Which certainly they could request and certainly a teacher should do,\" Chikwendu said. \"But they don't automatically have it. This plan says that they automatically have to do this, and I don't like that.\"\nColman said her intention for including that line in the plan was to be a support for teachers and not so that supervisors could go into Schoology and make changes.\n\"As you're wearing your teacher hat, if you're not seeing that as a support, that's not what I was going for,\" Colman said to Chikwendu.\nChikwendu said she agreed with offering it as a support but did not like the idea of making it mandatory. The board voted to approve the prolonged emergency virtual education plan on the condition that the content supervisor line is amended to be offered as support rather than mandatory.\nBefore the board passed the plan, the subject of camera usage in virtual classrooms was also brought up. In the plan, it says that cameras need to be turned on in the event that classes become virtual.\nChikwendu said she understood why having cameras on is important, but brought up concerns with bandwidth.\n\"When you have a classroom of even 15 students and all of their cameras are on and your camera is on, the bandwidth is horrible,\" she said, later adding, \"I get why we need to turn them on, I'm just wondering how we manage the bandwidth issues that come with keeping a whole class together for the period of time the Google Meet is on if we have all those kids' cameras on at the same time.\"\nColman said she went back and forth on this aspect of the plan. She said the district learned with the COVID-19 pandemic that not requiring cameras to be on creates a lack of accountability. She said a sentence could be added to the plan to explain that cameras can be turned off in the event of wifi or bandwidth issues.\nChikwendu said she just wanted to make sure everyone was aware of the issue.\nThe board also talked about students not feeling comfortable with classmates and teachers seeing their homes in the background in virtual classroom settings. Hubbard suggested using a standard background for all students on camera so that students' homes aren't in view. Colman said this was something the district could do. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Caroline County Public Library celebrates renovation\n\n May 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 505\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 Politicians, law enforcement, children and librarians all met at the Caroline County Public Library on Saturday to celebrate the completion of a years-long renovation.Over and over, people said the space feels brighter and more open. But beyond the library's physical appearance, the renovation project was designed to help the library continue to function as a hub of the community, offering a variety of programming for library patrons of different ages.\n\"We have got gaming stations in the teen zone and for adults we have study rooms and zoom meetings for tutoring,\" Nancy Pollen, a library associate said. \"We make it so much fun. We have puppet programs and read to a beagle.\"\nThe group gathered for a ribbon cutting amidst the stacks of books.\nYears of effort went into raising money and designing the new space. An architect of the project, Connie Kumor of RMM Architects, brought her family to the grand opening.\n\"A lot of the design was making the space more friendly and open,\" Kumor said. \"When we started the project, especially the children's area, there was a big dividing wall right down the middle, and there were no restrooms for families to use while they were in this space, and the lighting levels were a bit tough for a library environment. We really wanted to open up the space for everybody and make it more inviting.\"\nKumor said that all the renovation work was done to the interior and that the original footprint of the building did not change. She noted that Executive Director Debbie Bennett has been planning this project for a long time, and Kumor was happy to see it completed.\nBennett, who is retiring at the end of June after decades of service, was whirling around in the midst of many wellwishers.\n\"This is terribly exciting,\" Bennett said. \"We started in the fiscal year of 2019. We did a space utilization study and a design plan, then the renovation of the first floor, finally the replacement of the slate on the back pitched roof and a major upgrade on the elevator.\"\nShe said that this is one of her major legacies. It continued the effort that was started by the library founder John Hargreaves in 1961.\nShe also cited the Maryland State Library Capital Grant and all political support the library got from state legislators. There were also several large donations and hundreds of small donations from the community.\n\"We have a small but mighty Friends of the Library,\" Bennett said. \"I asked them to raise $50,000 for furniture, which wasn't included in the grant. They raised $78,000.\"\nIrene Padilla, the state librarian who was present at the ribbon cutting, said, \"We know what a great resource this is for Caroline County. Libraries play an important role in the success of any community.\n\"Beyond the 1,000s of books that you have on your shelves, there is the access to computers, the internet, makerspace, printing services and a myriad of digital resources. Thank you to the professional staff. We all need their help to succeed in the 20th century.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "BOE Approves Sysco Food Services\n\n May 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Andrea Grabenstein agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 683\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Centreville \u2014 Retaining food service employees is on the menu as the Queen Anne's County Public Schools Board of Education approved Sysco Eastern Maryland, LLC for food delivery services during its workshop meeting May 15.Facing a turbulent budget cycle the school board approved shifting its food service program to join a partnership with Maryland's Shore Educational Food Service Consortium contract with Sysco for the delivery of food and related products.\n\"There is no intention to cut any hourly staff, the number of people that are in the kitchens right now are needed to run those kitchens,\" Julie Hickey, coordinator of food services said.\nWith a variety of reasons the district made the food service decision, cost was one of them. The Sodexo contract was set to expire on June 30 and QACPS is now joining 22 other school systems that run in-house food-service programs in their districts.\nAs of July 2024, QACPS food services will be self-operational and no longer operated by Sodexo as a food service management company. In order to be self operational, a vendor contract is needed to provide the necessary food and items which is currently being procured through the district's food service management company, according to Hickey.\nThe district looks to save money in aspects such as management, by going self operational, she said, and will be joining forces with MSEC to join in a contract with Sysco.\nCaroline County put forth a bid for food and food related items and Sysco was the only bid received, Hickey said.\nThe MSEC contract contains a clause for Queen Anne's to partner and utilize the services. The contract was recently renewed for the third year to begin July 2024 with two more years of renewal options, she said.\nThe total estimated cost for FY25 is $800,000 and will utilize the food service balance account, according to Hickey.\nFood service department staff have been notified of the district's conversion to self-operational and have been given the opportunity to ask questions.\n\"No hourly positions are being cut and they are all encouraged to reapply when the positions become available, \" Hickey said.\nBoard member Richard Smith noted, \"I was back in the day when we had it in-house, then we went out, now we're back in.\"\nWhile the operational budget may not look different within the first year, Hickey emphasized, \"What we're doing is keeping that money in the county, and being able to prioritize and utilize local vendors which it cannot do right now,\" she said. By October, the district hopes to have a partnership with a local vendor in time for Homegrown School Week.\nIn addition to the cost savings, Board President Helen Bennet was particularly excited about the prospect of partnering with local farms, particularly for the benefit of FFA, and looked forward to updates as it moved forward.\nThe board's approval of the contract was necessary as the district needs to begin ordering food for summer programs and the start of next school year, Hickey said.\nIt was also noted, as the district shifts away from its current food service management company Sodexo, so too does its milk distributor service contract and the BOE approved piggybacking off of the MSEC milk contract with Cloverland Dairy.\nCloverland is QACPS's current milk provider through the Sodexo, so the approval just brings a different contract, Hickey said.\nPricing on half pints of regular milk are estimated to be better with the piggybacking contract, Hickey said.\nWicomico County Public Schools put the public bid out for milk delivery and the contract contains a piggyback clause for QACPS to jump on, she said.\nThe total price is expected to be $190,000 for the Fiscal Year 2025 and funding will come from the food service funding account, according to Hickey.\nAn established milk vendor is required as part of compliance with the national school lunch and breakfast programs and federal guidelines, she said.\nThe contract is in effect until June 2026 unless terminated early by Wicomico, which is unlikely, Hickey noted, as Clover Farm is one of the only dairies in the area that has K-12 compliant milk products and has been that way for some time.\nThe board will next meet June 5. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat.

    "content": "Student seeks to share Choptank River history\n\n May 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: NIAMBI DAVIS Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 967\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 Kennedy Thomason grew up as an avid reader of historical fiction.Now, after working towards a degree in history, Thomason is sharing her historical interests with countless others, thanks to her family's river cruise business.\nThe 2019 graduate of Ridgely's North Caroline High School carried her love of history to Chesapeake College, where she graduated with an associate's degree in liberal arts, followed by a transfer to Washington College in Chestertown to major in American studies.\n\"It's the liberal arts version of a history major,\" she explained, pointing to the Washington College website description as \"the exploration of U.S. culture and American national identity from cross-disciplinary perspectives in order to help students develop a rich understanding of the American experience.\"\n\"I chose this major because I'm particularly interested in how our history influences the society in which we live,\" she said. \"Understanding the human experiences that have led us to this point is vital to figuring out where we go from here. The study of history is the key to solving the labyrinth of social, economic and political problems we face today.\"\nAt the Starr Center for the American Experience, Thomason works as a digital archiving intern under the supervision of Melissa P. Kemp, the center's digital archivist and historian.\nShe scans, archives and uploads content into the Chesapeake Heartland archive, which features local African American families and their personal collections of family photos, home videos, yearbooks and other mementos they've collected over the years.\n\"I've learned a lot about digital history and its importance, as well as how tedious it can be,\" Thomason said.\nFor Thomason, the rewards of her Starr Center experience are many. \"It's the confidence boost and sense of community that comes from association with professors and students who are just as passionate as I am. At school I feel a sense of belonging and I'm exposed to opportunities that I never knew were available,\" she said.\nShe considers the most challenging aspect of student life as striking a balance between college, work and life. \"I am a unique undergraduate, especially for a Washington College student, because I have a two year old daughter. Most of the students around me at school still live at home or in dorms and are accustomed to only being responsible for themselves and their studies. Commuting from about an hour away, having a little person depending on me, a household to keep up with, and finding time to work has added many struggles that most of my peers do not have to navigate. But I wouldn't change it for the world!\"\nAs the oldest of the Thomason family's five children, Kennedy counts her parents as inspiration.\n\"I remember watching my mother wrangle five children. I learned a lot from my mom and I admire her and look up to her. She and my dad supported all five of us doing five different things. We have always been a very tight-knit family unit with parents who have provided immense support. I could not do what I do without them. They keep my daughter (whose name is Sailor) when I need them to. Our family has always functioned as a unit working towards whatever goal we have, that day, that week, whenever.\"\nWhen her family purchased Denton's Ellen B from Captain Bill Behlke, it was a given that the River City Cruise Company would be a family affair. Thomason immediately planned to add history as part of the river tours.\n\"I love the Choptank River,\" she said.\nAware of the deep historical roots she was certain that many Eastern Shore residents knew of the area's history and wanted to learn more.\n\"I'm a huge proponent of accessibility to history, which means I'm always trying to think of ways to bring history to the public rather than waiting for the public to seek it out,\" she said. \"The river tours are just one aspect of my advocacy.\"\nThe first year of the River City Cruise Company was a great success. \"I had the time of my life on each trip,\" Thomason recalled.\nHer favorite guests were the people who came along for the ride but found themselves fascinated by the stories of the Choptank's history and heritage.\n\"I also loved seeing people from our community learn more about the land. Although I love and appreciate the out-of-towners that come and enjoy everything the Choptank has to offer, seeing locals being able to connect their lives with the past is truly special. One thing that I tell each cruise is there's no reason that people, states or oceans away should know more about our land than us.\"\nThis year, she's revamping the script and expanding the talking points to make each cruise truly unique. \"I never want someone to feel that they came once and can't come again. I always want people to take away something new, even if they've taken the tour ten times.\"\nRecently, Thomason was awarded funds to complete her own Choptank River History project from the Gerda Blumenthal Grant through Washington College's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.\nOver the summer she'll publish a series of blog posts in conjunction with the Caroline County Historical Society's website that will focus on ways the Choptank has shaped the greater Caroline County community.\n\"My motto for the project has been that people tend to think of rivers as borders, but, historically, the Choptank has been the center,\" Thomason said. \"What exactly this project will look like I am still trying to work out, but I am excited about it. I plan on having at least one public event and my research will lead to a more robust history tour.\"\nThis fall Thomason will graduate from Washington College. She's still trying to figure out what she wants to do post-graduation. Whatever she chooses, the study of history will benefit.\nVisit River City Cruise Company on Facebook, email them at riverruncruise@gmail.comor call 410-673-8201. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Coopersmith recounted his journey as a community college graduate over 40 years ago.\nIn his speech, he referenced two themes he wanted to share with the graduates: the first acknowledges the extraordinary times they are living through, and the second theme is the hope that the graduates embody.\n\"I wish to focus on all of you, our first cohort of students graduating with degrees and certificates that were impacted the most by the immediate and following effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Coppersmith said. \"You have persevered in the most difficult times we have seen as a nation in decades, and your decision to pursue your education, to quote a colleague of mine, Dr. David Harper, is a sign of hope, in and of itself.\"\nAn array of individuals were honored, including Rob Thompson, current director of arts for Chesapeake College, who received the 2024-2026 Bounds Distinguished Teaching Chair Award.\nIn Thompson's speech, he spoke of Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for president in 1872, and her dedication to her dream for a more equal society. He described her as a pioneer for women's rights.\n\"Woodhull never asked for permission to try and change the world or to embark on any of the careers she took up,\" Thompson said. \"She felt an injustice, she found a purpose, and she took action in as many ways as she could think of. For as long as she could stand, it would all be a national figure. But as her story shows, she was just as focused on changing conditions in her home as she was on the nation.\"\nThompson described the importance of shaping homes and communities and the power that adapting after failure has on people.\n\"That's not so much persisting as it is adapting and seeking an alternative,\" Thompson said. \"Chasing dreams requires that you travel down some dark and twisting trails. But you've got to keep searching. My student's dreams and their remarkable capacity to show up with creative minds and passionate hearts have carried me through this career. I'm talking about you guys.\"\nAfter Thompson's speech, Milton Nagel, vice chair of the Chesapeake College Board of Trustees, presented the John T. Harrison Award to Zulema Delacruz Martinez. The John T. Harrison Award is given each year to a student who has demonstrated the highest academic performance, leadership and overall contributions to the college and the community.\nDelacruz Martinez was praised for her commitment to Hispanic and Latino students within the region who are interested in college but may be intimidated by the academic process. She has organized several events to welcome the students and their families to complete college applications and sign up for resource services.\nDuring her speech, Delacruz Martinez recounted her childhood growing up in a nontraditional home and witnessing the extraordinary hard work that her mother had to do to provide for her and her brother.\n\"My mother overcame so many obstacles while making so many sacrifices. It was then, at the age of 8, that I vowed to do the same. I decided I would learn from her experience of having a front-row seat to my mother's hardships as she overcame her adversities. All of those experiences have pushed me to persevere.\"\nShe recounted the resources her advisers gave her and the many people who helped guide and support her to finish. During her time at Chesapeake College, she founded the Hispanic Latino Student Union, learned to be a leader and found her home there.\nToward the end of her speech, Delacruz Martinez praised her classmates and offered words of encouragement.\n\"Take advantage of every opportunity that comes your way. Build upon meaningful relationships with those around you and keep persevering as you keep persevering. Whether that be in your future college endeavors or in your day-to-day lives,\" Delacruz Martinez said. \"I leave you with this quote: 'To make a great dream a reality. The first requirement is a great capacity to dream. The second is persistence.'\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Graduation ceremonies held for local homeschool students\n\n May 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DOUG BISHOP | Section: News \n \n 805\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Saturday afternoon, May 18, students who have been homeschooled under the umbrella of Shore Christian Fellowship, were awarded diplomas. The ceremony was held inside Shore Christian Fellowship Church in Queenstown.Homeschool commencement programs have been held at the church for more than a decade. This year's graduating class of 10 is the largest class yet. Students in the Class of 2024 are: Cody Blunt, Ashlyn Boyles, Alyssa Jastram, Kylee Koss, Makayla Larson, Mason Patterson, and Hayden Winborne.\nLora Largent, Shore Christian Fellowship's homeschool umbrella coordinator for many years, made the arrangements for commencement program. All five of Largent's own children have graduated as homeschoolers.\nLargent said, \"There were three other students who were part of this year's class, but chose not to join us for the ceremony. So, we really have 10 graduates this year.\"\nAs part of the program, all seven graduates, individually, got up to the podium to speak, if to say nothing more than thank you to their parents for dedicating themselves to helping them with their educations. Each also selected a verse from the Bible they found impressive and meaningful in their lives. Those verses were shared in a power-point presentation prior to the graduation ceremony.\nSeveral of the parents also spoke at the podium, congratulating their child, and the other graduates.\nAs for future challenges, each graduate listed what's next in their lives. Cody plans on becoming an electrician and will embark on training to become a journeyman in that profession. Ashlyn has a late June wedding planned and will be attending River Bible Institute in Tampa, this fall. She is an accomplished ice skater which she's been doing since she was three. Alyssa will be attending the University of Kentucky this fall, majoring in Equine Business and Management with a minor in Communications. She will be a member of the UK Eventing Team, and hopes to earn a spot of the USA Olympic Equestrian Team. Kylee has many interests, hoping to teach and continue her passion with competitive dancing. Makayla who has been taking classes in dual enrollment at Chesapeake College, was the founder of the college's mental health club which currently has 28 members, and will be serving as Vice President of the college's SGA next semester. She plans to eventually earn her PhD in psychology. Mason will also be attending River Bible Institute in Tampa. Hayden plans to find a career in Cyber Security.\nOf the students who were interviewed, none of them said they felt they missed out on anything by transitioning to the homeschool program. Kylee said, \"I felt homeschool provided me with more opportunities than if I had stayed in regular school classes.\" Makayla added, \"I needed a more mature setting than what I found in school when I left to do homeschooling. I was still able to have my friends and socialize with them.\"\nMost of the homeschool student graduates started in public schools, but moved to homeschooling when the pandemic started. They decided to stay with homeschooling when the pandemic ended.\nTo conclude the commencement program, Pastor Tom Chandler provided \"a challenge\" to the graduates going forward with their lives. He said, \"I'm a homeschool parent. I understand the sacrifices that are made to do a homeschool program with your child. However, the benefits outweigh the sacrifices \u2014 we call that, investments in the future. You parents are to be commended for your commitment to your children's educations.\"\nHe continued, saying \"Jesus said, 'There is no greater sacrifice one can make than to give up their life to another. We all need to remember that in our own lives. Living a life that prioritizes selfless, loving sacrifice for others rather than living for self. Ultimately, living each day to the benefit of the next generation.\"\nHomeschool programs must be supervised by local public schools to ensure that students of all ages are truly receiving an education at home. Largent said, \"We, at Shore Christian Fellowship, serve as an 'umbrella' of the homeschool program. We help make sure parents are following the homeschool program as it is designed. We meet with parents, answer any questions, explain anything they might not understand. We make sure their children meet all the requirements to help their children get their education's properly. You can do it with our help, or do it yourself by going directly to the board of educations to file the proof of learning they are doing at home. Those filings must take place at least twice a year, if you want to do it yourself, rather than ask of help from us.\"\nLargent also said, \"We have more than 100 families registered in the homeschool program at Shore Christian Fellowship who we are helping. It's the most we've ever had.\"\nThere are other families within Queen Anne's County, who report directly to Queen Anne's County Public Schools who are not part of the SCF umbrella. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Thank you for your service\n\n May 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 633\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Michael Feehley and Tom Carlson are on a mission.The two veterans want young people to respect veterans and understand the sacrifices they have made.\nOn Friday, Feehley and Carlson, with the help of some students, put up dozens of flags along the drive at the Easton Elks Lodge.\nThe veterans replaced the weather-worn flag at the lodge. Carlson, a decorated veteran and member of the Elks, moved with quiet precision to attach the flag and hoist it. The two men worked together. This was not their first rodeo.\nFeehley takes veterans of all military branches into the schools to teach the kids a simple message \u2014 thank you for your service.\n\"I really think that from after the Korean War, even though this country was in a few conflicts, to when the Gulf War started, veterans were lost in the shuffle,\" Feehley said. \"Nobody gave them any recognition that I think a veteran deserves.\"\nHe is reminded of a famous saying: \"All gave some and some gave all.\"\n\"That all gave some is what I try to impart, which is why I started what we call a teach-in at the schools,\" Feehley said.\nAt Easton Elementary School, he teaches that veterans are all around us.\n\"The veteran is their school bus driver. A veteran may be their teacher. A veteran is their mom or dad or sister, their brother, the next-door neighbor,\" Feehley said.\nSome veterans have a different rhythm than 9 to 5 workers. When it is time to serve, they go.\n\"But that veteran also was away from their family for a long time,\" he said.\nHe and his team teach that some veterans have a tough time when they get back.\n\"That veteran sometimes didn't have the same advantages they have today. They might not be able to take a shower for more than a week. They might not have had any opportunities to watch television or to listen to the radio,\" Feehley said.\nHe teaches that the veterans' families can go through loss.\n\"The veteran's family had to do without their dad or their brother or their uncle or their cousin at the table or the family reunions,\" Feehley said.\nHe tells students not to take the liberties they have for granted.\n\"They have the choice of what TV show to watch. They have the choice of whether to pack your lunch or get it at school. To have the choice of what clothes you are wearing today. If it wasn't for a veteran, you might not have those choices,\" Feehley said.\nSo how should his students and the public engage with vets when we see them? What can be said?\n\"When you are walking through the parking lot and you see a car that has a Coast Guard sticker on the bumper and you see the driver simply say, 'Thank you,' and they will know exactly what you are talking about,\" Feehley said.\nHe says the young students are enthusiastic and engaged. He has members from each of the armed forces for each session where he acts as the moderator.\n\"I direct the question to a particular veteran. When the kids, who are in school, leave (our program) they are smiling. They can't get enough. When the assembly is over, they still want to interact with the veterans up on the stage. Fifth graders, fourth graders,\" he said.\nIt is not a recruiting effort. It is a lesson in gratitude.\nHe does what he does to remind people.\n\"Everybody who served in the armed forces gave something. Here is how we make your life a little better every day. Better than perhaps what it could have been. The kids love it. The teachers love it. The veterans hope they can come back next year,\" Feehley said.\n\"I think the best part is to try and let the kids know what a veteran is and why to say, 'Thank you.'\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS \u2014 On Wednesday evening, the community supported 63 students from St. Michaels High School as they received their diplomas.Senior Class President Madi White welcomed the students' loved ones and congratulated the Class of 2024 for their accomplishments. In her speech, she expressed the hardships that her class had endured to get to graduation.\n\"The faces, the smiles, the tears, they all represent a journey of great memories and unforgettable hardships,\" White said. \"Four years, 1461 days and 35,064 hours \u2026 That number didn't feel real because it's hard to believe that we spent a kajillion seconds waiting for this moment ... Before we dive headfirst into our ceremony, we must acknowledge how we got here. Our support system was none other than the best.\"\nAt the end of her speech, White reminded her classmates that they are not facing the future alone but with that robust support system.\nAfter the welcome speech, graduate Will Bridges presented the mantel, a time-honored tradition at St. Michaels High School. Bridges then passed the mantle over to Lexi Rockwell, president of the junior class.\n\"It is a symbol of all the ideals and principles for which our school stands and a badge of seniority,\" Bridges said. \"Tonight, we must surrender the club to the class of 2025. We hereby give the honor, place, privilege and responsibility to live up to the lofty ideals of which the garment is a symbol. I say to you, take it, love it.\"\nNathan Henckel gave the valedictorian address. In his speech, he expressed the excitement that his class had in anticipation of this day. Henckel quoted Hannah Montana, referring to her as \"one of the most influential icons of our time.\"\n\"'Of course, I always knew this day would come; we'd be standing one by one with the future in our hands, so many dreams, so many plans,'\" Henckel said. \"Yet, despite being in this room right now, with all of our future plans set, we cannot ignore how this journey began.\"\nHe expressed the difficulties of losing a part of his education journey to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Henckel said that as he reflected on his high school years, he found that his teacher, Lauren Greer, had encouraged and uplifted him.\n\"Whether I needed to ask the question about the stem from protein synthesis, have an email proofread, or simply needed a space to vibe..., 547 was always a place for me,\" Henckel said. \"It's because of teachers like this that I feel extremely prepared for all my future endeavors.\"\nTalbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi, an alumnus of St. Michaels High School, congratulated the class. Pepukayi advised the graduates to appreciate this time in their lives and to do as their chosen class motto said: \"Just keep swimming.\"\n\"Be an example, inspire others, use your talents and gifts, bring it around, take everything in this evening,\" Pepukayi said. \"Because soon enough, you'll be back in the race ... Congratulations. Best of luck, no matter if you breaststroke, sidestroke, butterfly or doggy paddle. Just keep swimming.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The students sitting before you tonight have exemplified resilience more than any of us adults have before the age of 18. They have had musicals canceled, sports seasons cut short, dances canceled, and couldn't find sustainable employment during the pandemic. But I can tell you one thing\u2026.these kids came out on top! I don't want to focus on what they have lost tonight, but rather what they have gained.\"\nIt was noted that this class rose above COVID their freshman year, earned $14,095,882 in scholarships and completed over 37,291 service learning hours.\nTCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi came up to the lectern in a green robe.\n\"I am humbled to serve a little over 4,500 students but for this evening we are focusing on these 278 students that will soon become Easton High Warrior alumni,\" Pepukayi said. \"... Be great and make mistakes. Fail forward again and again. Dare to learn something new.\"\nValedictorian Iven Chen stood up from his chair and addressed the audience and his fellow Warriors. He remembered losing the whole first year to COVID and not even coming to campus. But the proper rhythm was restored as the four years went by.\n\"If you're like me, you'll worry about not making enough memories once you realize your time is almost over. You feel the urge to make the most of your lasts as they start piling up: your last year, your last homecoming, your last game, your last prom, all leading up to your last day,\" Chen said.\nHe hit a funny and poignant note about life's choices as they become adults.\n\"If there's one thing you should take away from this, it's that you have the ability to pursue your own path. You've done this before when navigating the maze of high school, and you can definitely do it again. Heck, if there are too many walls in your way, just be like the Kool-Aid man and bust your way through them,\" Chen said.\nThe salutatorian was Sabin Long, who said he noticed how time passing had changed him, ultimately helping him reach this moment of graduation.\n\"Wherever you all are going in the next part of your life, I hope the community there welcomes you the way the community here has welcomed me \u2014 the way you all have welcomed me,\" Long said.\nSenior Class President Colin Smith and TCPS Board Member and Senior Class Executive President Samantha Jessee also addressed the packed auditorium.\nSmith said, \"Take this opportunity to break the pattern. Run that race, take that trip, make that new friend. We only have one opportunity to live our lives. We only live once, and there are no second chances.\"\nJessee said, \"Being captain of the cheer team allowed my passion for school spirit to thrive. EHS has laid out the blueprint for our successes, making conquering and achieving our dreams more than obtainable. In the words of Elvis Presley, you've gotta follow that dream, wherever that dream may lead.\"\nThen it was time for the diplomas to be handed out. Dr. Pepukayi and Emily Jackson, president of the Talbot County Board of Education, handed out 287 diplomas.\nAfter every one was honored, they turned their tassels and threw their caps in the air. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He talked about a student who, over the last four years, went from not attending class, to arguing with Tucker to calling Tucker the reason they come to school every day.\n\"There were a lot of times that I didn't want to get up and come to school, but I thought (about) what you told me,\" Tucker said about the student. \"And it inspired me to get here. Maybe not on time, but I got here.\"\nThe graduation ceremony brought tears and laughter on Thursday evening. Along with the speeches, the CSD chorus performed \"I Lived\" by OneRepublic, and the students, along with some staff and administration members, performed \"Don't Stop Believin'\" by Journey and \"The Time of My Life\" by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now, it's your time to shine.\"\nThis year's valedictorian is Ben Loller, who will be heading to prestigious Brown University this fall to study computer science. The salutatorian is Madison Messick; she earned a full ride to the University of Maryland, College Park.\nThose are just two of the many accomplishments Hemstetter listed.\nThere were increased numbers of students who achieved dual-completer status for finishing a Career and Technical Education pathway, of students taking Advanced Placement classes and exams, of students earning dual enrollment credits through classes at Chesapeake College and Washington College and so much more.\nLooking to their immediate future plans, 70% of the class will be attending a two- or four-year college or trade school, 26% of the class will be entering the workforce and 4% have enlisted in the military.\n\"As you venture into new territories \u2014 be it college, careers, workforce, military or other pursuits \u2014 never forget the power of your authenticity,\" Hemstetter told the class. \"It's your genuine self that will open doors, forge connections and create lasting impact.\"\nDr. Karen Couch, superintendent of Kent County Public Schools, offered her remarks in a video message. She was attending her grandson's high school graduation in Howard County.\nCouch spoke about the immense pride and enthusiasm she has for the graduating seniors, many of whom she has known since she arrived in Kent County at the start of their second-grade year.\n\"Graduates, as you stand on the threshold of new beginnings, remember the journey that brought each one of you here today,\" she said. \"With those first uncertain steps in our hallways to this moment of time, you have demonstrated resilience, passion and dedication to excellence.\"\nCouch said the class of 2024 \"embodies the best of our values: integrity, resiliency and a commitment to learning.\"\n\"You're not just graduates, you are the future, ready to make your mark on the world,\" she said. \"My heartiest of congratulations goes out to the Class of 2024. May your futures be bright, your lives full of joy and your contributions meaningful.\"\nThis year's graduation speaker was Darius Johnson, a member of the KCHS class of 2011 and now the Digital Justice Fellow at Washington College's Starr Center for the Study if the American Experience.\nHe spoke to the students about the importance of finding their own paths to success. He said that if he had followed other people's vision of success, he wouldn't be happy.\n\"In this next chapter, each of you must define what success means for you,\" he said. \"Write your plans in pencil, embrace change and walk with certainty, even if people doubt you, or if you doubt yourself. I'm here to tell you that you'll be alright.\"\nIn addition to being salutatorian, Messick has served as a student member of the Kent County Board of Education and the Citizen Advisory Committee as well as in the Maryland Student Page Program of General Assembly.\nShe spoke about how the Class of 2024 \"navigated through a whirlwind of experiences, challenges and triumphs\" and persevered in the face of hardships.\nShe said each member of the class has unique talents and urged them to use those \"to build a future that reflects the values of compassion, empathy and equality.\"\n\"May your futures be as bold and brilliant as the people I know you are today,\" Messick told her classmates. \"Together, let us continue to change the world by simply being ourselves.\"\nLoller, who among his extra-curricular activities also has served on the Citizen Advisory Committee and been a member of the KCHS Coding Team, used a metaphor about three skiers in his speech.\nHe said the first skier is focused on the trees and ice patches \u2014 the obstacles in the way to success. For the second skier, he said it is all about the path. He said the third skier failed to set the alarm and never made it to the mountain.\n\"I believe there have been times when we could all relate to him,\" Loller quipped.\nHe encouraged his classmates to be like the second skier, saying that by focusing on the path they will naturally overcome the obstacles and hardships along the way.\n\"Stay focused on your goals, stay focused on the destination, stay focused on your experiences. And keep your path forever clear,\" Loller said.\nClass of 2024 Secretary Jessica Rosanova served as the hostess of ceremonies. Jaeda Hoxter, class of 2024 vice president, introduced the platform guests. Guadalupe Duarte Arellano, Student Government Association president, gave the Senior Welcome and Ryan Myers, class of 2024 president, delivered the Message to Seniors. Class Historian Melissa Landon introduced Johnson as the guest speaker.\nCapping off the commencement ceremony, SGA Secretary Addisyn Litton led her classmates through the turning of their class rings and tassels, announcing them as graduates of KCHS.\nAs parents and family members and teachers, staff and administrators cheered, mortarboards went flying into the air and the class of 2024 showed their 24-karat shine, celebrating their graduation from Kent County High School. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They wore mortar boards and walked in unison to the strains of \"Pomp and Circumstance.\"\nNCHS's graduation was on May 29. Colonel Richardson's was the following evening.\nThere were uplifting messages about the future. And remembrances of their freshman year during the COVID outbreak.\nThere were all kinds of future journeys for the graduates. Some young men and women were headed off to serve in the military, some were headed to colleges and some were going to trade schools. Some were just ready to get to work.\nThe principal of Colonel Richardson is Jared Sherman. And Matt Spiker is the principal of North Caroline High School.\nSherman posted, \"Congratulations to our newest CRHS alumni.

    "content": "Dorchester County talks Blueprint with MACo\n\n June 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 776\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Maryland Association of Counties President Johnny Olszewski told the Dorchester County Council at a council meeting June 4 that Dorchester County is not alone in \"feeling the pinch\" from the Blueprint for Maryland's Future requirements.\"It's large counties too,\" said Olszewski, who is also the county executive for Baltimore County and the Democratic nominee Maryland's 2nd congressional district. \"I think we're seeing, every year, a few more jurisdictions of varying sizes as sort of hitting that point where it's like 'Oh man, how are we going to actually make this all work?'\"\nAt the June 4 meeting, which Olszewski and MACo Executive Director Michael Sanderson attended to present on the association's efforts and hear from the county, council members talked about their concerns with being able to fund Blueprint.\nBlueprint is a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state through increasing education funding by $3.8 billion over a 10 year period.\n\"I'm not against education, I'm not against teachers,\" council member Ricky Travers said. \"I want to see the kids get a great education. But is throwing money at it going to do it?\"\nTravers said that funding the Blueprint requirements is forcing the county to strip its other services.\n\"They want to buy a Lamborghini on a Toyota budget, and they want to pay for it in a really short time,\" he said.\nSanderson told the council that it's not lost on him that income taxes and property taxes are the main revenue sources for county governments. He said that because two-thirds of Marylanders are at the \"absolute cap\" on the income tax, property taxes are the only way counties are going to be able to pay for their share of the Blueprint.\n\"It's exactly the wrong way to try and fund it,\" Sanderson said. \"Even if you're a big fan of the progressive policies in the Blueprint.\"\nThose policies include expanding full-day pre-K for children in families with incomes up to 300% of the federal poverty line, increasing teacher starting salaries to $60,000 by 2026, implementing a new college and career readiness standard and increasing funding for special education and multilingual learner students.\nIn November, MACo sent a letter to Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson and Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne Jones writing that \"in many ways,\" the Blueprint is a one-size-fits-all approach to investing in education in a state with \"diverse local government capacities, processes and abilities.\"\nThe letter says that record county funding and additional mandated funding for Blueprint will make it difficult for counties to fund other things in their jurisdiction.\nIn the letter, MACo makes a variety of requests \u2014 including a more comprehensive cost analysis of the Blueprint, an increase in state aid for the renovation and construction of pre-K facilities and more time for the development of educator career ladder models \u2014 to ensure the Blueprint's success.\nAt the meeting, council member Rob Kramer pointed out that 72% of Dorchester County is considered critical area, like wetlands, and cannot be built on. He said that under the new critical areas map, that percentage will increase to 78%. With only so much space that can be built on, how much the county's property tax revenues, which pay for Blueprint requirements, can increase without raising taxes is limited.\n\"We're a small county and we basically rely on property taxes to operate,\" Kramer said. \"So that makes it tough on the ones that do own property here.\"\nCouncil member William Nichols said he refuses to raise taxes on seniors. He said their are a lot of seniors in his district, and they can't afford higher taxes.\nDuring his presentation to the council, Sanderson brought up the Cade Funding Formula for community colleges, which received a reduction from the state for fiscal year 2025, and highway user revenues, which Sanderson said could receive cuts in the future.\nOlszewski said talked about how this affects counties, especially when they have to meet Blueprint requirements.\n\"It sort of becomes, well we can't fund community colleges and roads and all the other things and meet their obligations,\" he said about the Blueprint requirements.\nSanderson said that for any county governing body that doesn't meet Blueprint requirements, its county income taxes will be sent directly to the schools, rather than to the county.\nAt the end of the conversation, Olszewski talked about the importance of facilitating these conversations between MACo and Maryland counties.\n\"They're so helpful because they us sort of inform the legwork (we're) heading into,\" he said. \"And it's already sounding like Blueprint is going to be another major issue that we are going to be taking up in the year ahead.\" \n\n Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Children struggling to read (for any reason), can request a session with a canine and handler at the library. It is proven that canines open many doors for children struggling emotionally and physically. Children feel comfortable with a canine. Canines break down barriers, do not judge, are fluffy, motivate and create trust.I have been visiting special needs classrooms in Talbot and Queen Anne's counties, as well as hospitals, nursing homes, physical therapy centers, doctors' offices and psychological sessions since 2012 with my canines. I have had four canines, all female rottweilers, approved as therapy dogs. My current dog, and previous dog, were members of Alliance of Therapy Dogs and Crisis Response Canines.\nThe requirements for both groups are strict. Dogs and handlers have a background check and must pass handling tests. My dogs are desensitized to loud noises, children yelling, falling on them, sirens, etc. They are obedient and trust me. My dogs have over 1,000 visits, and have earned National Recognition for their Therapy Work.\nLast August, I set up my calendar with visits to seven classrooms at Easton Elementary School, for the September-December session. A few weeks before the session began, I was forwarded a letter by one of the teachers, saying that no dogs were allowed at school. My first thought was that this decision would hurt the many children we help.\nI never received any updates. Nothing. After a few months, I was told (anonymously) that the decision was based on \"policy change,\" I was told Jovie and I would be back in classrooms before 2024. Not to be. It is now too late in the school year to start visiting classrooms. I'm not sure if, or when we will be allowed back in Talbot County Public Schools.\nIn 12 years, my dogs have never had an issue. We have excellent insurance coverage through our therapy groups. We do all of this without compensation. We do this for the children. I am deeply saddened by this. I can't believe this would happen in Talbot County. My hope is that we will be back visiting children in need, at Easton Elementary School, next September.\nBARBARA LEE JEFFERSON\nEaston \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Aiman, 54, of Rising Sun, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault, a misdemeanor that is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. In exchange, prosecutors dismissed related charges of reckless endangerment and false imprisonment.\nAiman's defense lawyer, Thomas C. Morrow of Towson, told the judge that Aiman is on administrative leave, a status that school officials assigned Aiman shortly after a Rising Sun Police Department officer filed criminal charges against him in the wake of the early-May incident.\nJoseph Buckley, who is the Cecil County Public Schools associate superintendent for administrative services, told the Cecil Whig on Thursday that the situation is under review.\n\"We are aware of the legal matter that's facing one of our employees, and we're going to follow all of our human resources processes to access the situation to address the matter,\" he said. \"We'll be working with the employee to address the matter. Other than that, at this point, we really have no further comment.\"\nAiman chased the two boys in the early evening of May 4, which was a Saturday, after they rang the doorbell at his residence in the 200 block of Turtleneck Court and ran away \u2014 a prank known as \"ding dong ditch.\"\nAfter catching the teens across the street from his home, Aiman forced them back to his front porch, where he made the boys wait for police officers to respond after calling authorities and making a harassment complaint, according to court records.\nOfficers responded to the scene at 7:32 p.m., and Aiman told them that he \"gripped one up,\" referring to one of the teens. Aiman maintained that he gave chase after the second time that the ding-dong-ditch prank had been pulled at his residence that evening.\nIn the courtroom Wednesday, Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Verratti reported that Aiman grabbed one of the boys by his sweatshirt, lifted him up by the garment and kneed him in the ribs. Verratti said that Aiman handled the situation in \"an aggressive manner,\" which included him yelling at the boys.\nPolice informed Aiman that \"he could not put his hands on juveniles and that it does classify as an assault,\" according to court records.\n\"(Aiman) did not seem to understand, asking what he was supposed to do \u2014 let them run away. (Aiman) continually stated that he just held the kids on his front porch until the police arrived,\" court records show.\nAiman did not know the boys, who live in his neighborhood, according to the defense.\nInvestigators filed charges of second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and false imprisonment against Aiman on May 5, a day after the incident, and served him the criminal summons on May 6, court records show. He was released on personal recognizance. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

In front of a packed Buccaneer's stadium, several representatives from the class gave parting words of advice to their classmates.Darcy Lynn, the Class of 2024 valedictorian, welcomed family, friends, faculty, and her fellow graduates. She acknowledged the significance of the day and the importance of the decisions the graduates would make about their future. Lynn emphasized that while major life decisions, like choosing a college or career path, are daunting, it is the small, everyday choices that truly define a person's character.\nShe stressed that these minor actions, from how one interacts with others to behaviors when no one is watching, are the true indicators of who a person is. Lynn reminded her classmates, \"These actions make up who you are inside and reveal your true character.\"\nLynn paid tribute to Jacob Sloan, a classmate who died during their seventh grade year. She said that many graduates were wearing red heart pins in his honor. Sloan was known for his kindness and his habit of making others smile through small acts of generosity, like sitting with someone who was alone at lunch or making someone laugh when they were feeling down.\nIn an emotional tribute, Lynn continued, \"Jake always went out of his way to brighten someone else's day by performing small acts of kindness.\"\nSloan's lasting impact on their class, and his memory continues to inspire them to be kind and supportive of others. She encouraged her peers to carry on Sloan's legacy by making the world a better place through their everyday actions.\n\"While Jake may not be with us today, the mark he left on many of us remains,\" Lynn said. \"It is our job to carry on his kindness through our next steps in life.\"\nIn concluding her speech, Lynn urged her classmates to consider who they wanted to be as they moved forward in life. She reminded them that small choices, such as giving a compliment or helping someone, could significantly impact others.\nQuoting Taylor Swift, Lynn said, \"No matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind.\"\nShe ended by congratulating her classmates and encouraging them to embrace their future with the same spirit of kindness and community that Jake Sloan had exemplified.\nJake Sloan's message endures in Queen Anne's through the foundation set up to honor him.

He said he is most excited about the opportunity to serve the community and be a part of something bigger than himself.\n\"(As superintendent) you're just one small piece,\" he said. \"But I think you can be the catalyst to help change a school system and ultimately change the community.\"\nThompson hopes to bring the district's ranking up from 23rd to 15th in the state. To do that, he said the district will need to improve its instructional practices as well as the climate and culture within its schools.\nBefore taking on the role of interim superintendent, Thompson served as the district's assistant superintendent. Thompson previously served as assistant principal and principal of Mace's Lane Middle School.\nBoard President Mike Diaz said in a news release the board was fortunate to attract \"well-qualified candidates\" to the open position, but Thompson \"stood out as the best fit.\"\n\"The entire board looks forward to working alongside Dr. Thompson to ensure that all Dorchester County children have the opportunity to reach their full potential,\" Diaz said.\nThompson's official start date as superintendent is July 1. According to the news release, the board will vote to approve Thompson's contract at its regular meeting Thursday.\nThompson said he is \"all about the students\" and wants to ensure the district is producing kids that can compete in all fields at a national and global level.\n\"Right now I don't think we've done too good of a job of that,\" he said. \"So we've got room to grow, and that's what we plan on doing over the next five years.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Students are chosen according to the practices of their individual schools and are responsible for providing information about activities and events occurring at their school and the elementary and middle schools in their area.\nSimmons introduced both students and their extensive leadership roles and accomplishments.\nOdidika is a senior at Colonel Richardson High School. She is treasurer of the Straight Gay Alliance, a member of the National Honor Society and the Technical Honor Society, and a member of the LEO Club, orchestra and chorus.\nAfter graduation, Odidika plans to be a pediatric emergency physician.\nBelle is a junior at North Caroline High School. She is treasurer of the class of 2026, as well as treasurer of the Student Government Association, student ambassador for the Maryland Business Roundtable, co-director of the Regional Policy Director of the Eastern Shore of Maryland AYA and a member of TRIO Upward Bound. She is involved in the intensive law trial program at Stanford University and plans to study law after graduation.\nSimmons described the students as outstanding representatives of their schools and said he looked forward to the leadership they will bring as student representatives to the board.\n\"We are thrilled to have you guys, and we're looking forward to a great year together next year, so thank you all for being here tonight,\" Simmons said. \"This is the only night where you won't be sitting up here at a table for a while and contributing and being a part of it, but we are thrilled to have you here tonight and being able to come out.\"\nA former student representative was in the crowd as well, and she advised Odidika and Belle to take time to visit the other schools, including the elementary and middle schools in the county. She also encouraged them to check out any events happening in those schools and engage with the community so they have a better understanding of the community they will help make decisions for.\nAt the end of the introductions, Simmons also gave the student representatives a piece of advice.\n\"Feel free to make the most of it and be part of it and help provide your voice when we're at board meetings and feedback and those things as well,\" Simmons said.\nThe student representatives will begin their responsibilities in September. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "DCPS approves fiscal year 2025 budget in 3 to 1 vote\n\n June 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1386\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Although the Dorchester County Board of Education approved the district's fiscal year 2025 budget on June 3, not everyone felt what was proposed was ready for approval.On social media, county residents shared their concerns, and board member Chris Wheedleton, who could not be at the meeting due to a work conflict, said he was shocked when he found out the budget had been approved.\n\"I as a board member then should have had the opportunity to receive feedback from the community (and) talk with the community about some of the ideas that we should have around that budget so that, by the time we voted, I was equipped to have all that feedback,\" he said.\nOne aspect of the balanced $88.5 million operating budget that drew particular concern \u2014 and has since been reversed \u2014 was the decision to remove media specialists from libraries, redistributing them to other positions in the school system and putting instructional assistants in the libraries.\nThis would have contributed to the district saving over $313,000, or 32.3%, in salaries and wages expenditures compared to fiscal year 2024, according to board documents.\nBoard member Talibah Chikwendu, who voted against approving the budget, said during the meeting that she thought the board needed to look harder at the budget to find other ways to save that money.\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat Thursday, Chikwendu said she did not like some of the ways that the district's financial concerns were being resolved.\n\"I like the fact that we got a chance to work to resolve them,\" she said, later adding, \"It wasn't about media specialists as much as it was about any frontline staff.\"\nChikwendu said if another category of staff had been moved around like that, \"the objection would have been the same.\"\nAt the meeting, North Dorchester High School librarian Jacqueline Bennett talked about the impact of her role in the school and asked that the district not remove media specialists from libraries.\n\"I understand that you have to make tough decisions, but I've devoted my life to this,\" she said.\nBoard member Sheri Hubbard, who voted in favor of the budget, said she agreed that \"it would be a shame\" to move media specialists to other positions in the district, and clarified that approval of the budget did not mean they couldn't amend it.\nIn an interview Friday, Board President Mike Diaz, who also voted to approve the budget, said Dorchester County Public Schools Interim Superintendent Jymil Thompson made a decision later in the week to not redistribute its media specialists to other positions in the school system.\nOn Wednesday morning, DCPS communications and community outreach specialist Valerie Goff said in an email that the district is \"looking at other means to mitigate the budget shortfalls.\" Goff said Thompson met with district media specialists June 6 to reassure them that their positions are secure.\nLeading up to the district announcing Thompson's decision, multiple took to social media expressing frustrations. Some called on residents to reach out to the Board of Education.\nLucas Thorpe, who ran for Diaz's board seat in the May primaries and lost, took to social media to express his discontent.\nThorpe said in an interview that he doesn't think taking librarians out of the libraries would benefit literacy scores. He said the entire situation points to a larger issue of elected officials trying to run the school system like a business, without considering students and staff.\nThorpe brought up the district's alternative education contract with Vision Quest, which the district is paying more than $93,000 per month for, as well as two alternative education programs with Transforming Lives for elementary and middle schools that the board approved at the June 3 meeting. He said that although alternative education is important, the public needs to draw concern to these contracts.\nDiaz said in an interview that alternative education is something DCPS has used for many years. He said the Board felt Vision Quest was \"best poised\" to provide services to the district, and mentioned there are services built into the program like family functional therapy.\nUNANSWERED QUESTIONS\nAlthough Wheedleton was aware the budget had been included on the agenda for the meeting, he said he communicated with the Finance Committee \u2014 made up of Diaz, board Vice President Susan Morgan, Thompson and DCPS Assistant Comptroller Laurie Dale \u2014 ahead of the meeting to say he didn't think the board was ready to approve the budget.\nWheedleton told them he still needed answers to some \"significant questions\" related to the budget approval process so that he could support the budget moving forward.\n\"I asked, both verbally and in writing, when we would be having a community meeting to share both the challenges and the priorities that we were working through, when we would have a meeting where we were expected to vote and what needed to be submitted to either the state or the county,\" Wheedleton said in an interview with the Star Democrat on Friday. \"And I still have yet to receive answers to those questions.\"\nIn the interview, Wheedleton spoke about the importance of receiving community feedback in the budget process. He said that, instead, the board made a decision at a meeting they knew he wouldn't be able to attend and gave no time for community feedback on Thompson's budget presentation.\nWheedleton said that although he is expressing his concerns publicly, he remains committed to working with the board to find \"productive solutions.\"\n\"I really do want us to learn from this and move forward in a way that we can all work together to make the best possible decisions for the schools and our students,\" he said.\nAt the meeting, Diaz said unlike previous years where it would take about two months of work to get the budget to the finish line, the fiscal year 2025 budget process started in January.\n\"I can't tell you how many meetings we did and the hours that we committed to really getting into this thing to make it what it is right now,\" Diaz said at the meeting. \"Nobody's ever going to be perfect, and I think there's probably still some more work to do ongoing as we move through this thing.\"\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat Friday, Diaz said there are some things the board will agree on and others that it won't. He said it's inevitable that there are times when board members can't attend a meeting.\n'FISCAL CLIFF'\nThe balanced $88.5 million operating budget is a $7.4 million increase from fiscal year 2024.\nState revenue sources total $59.9 million, an increase of $4.6 million from fiscal year 2024. County revenue sources total $23.7 million, a decrease of $265,200 from fiscal year 2024. The remaining revenue comes from fund balance carryover from prior years and other funding sources, like investment income and building use income.\nCompared to the fiscal year 2024 budget, fixed charges expenditures increased 22%, from $17.8 million. Pupil services had the second largest increase between fiscal year 2024 and 2025 budgets, increasing 7.8%, from $2.7 million to $6.8 million.\nIn his budget presentation at the June 3 meeting, Thompson talked about the \"fiscal cliff\" that is coming with COVID-19-related Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funding and Maryland Leads grant funding coming to an end.\nDiaz said the district is trying to dial it back when it comes to spending. In January, the board asked for an audit trail so it could look at every financial transaction the district makes.\n\"We had an overspending problem,\" Diaz said. \"And to get the house back in order, we've got to do certain things to right that ship. And it's painful sometimes. And they're hard decisions to make.\"\nBoard members also talked about costs that are out of the district's control. Diaz mentioned inflation and Morgan, who voted to approve the budget, said there was a requirement of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future that the district will need to increase teacher starting salaries to $60,000 by 2026.\n\"That's not an easy thing to do,\" she said. \"And that's causing a lot of money to be poured into personnel.\"\nThompson warned that it's possible more cuts will need to be made down the road.\n\"We really have to look at our financial situation,\" he said, later adding, \"Our financial situation hasn't improved, and we've made a lot of poor decisions that have gotten us into this situation that we're in currently.\"\nThis story has been updated to include the district's response. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said he is most excited about the opportunity to serve the community and be a part of something bigger than himself.\n\"(As superintendent) you're just one small piece,\" he said. \"But I think you can be the catalyst to help change a school system and ultimately change the community.\"\nThompson hopes to bring the district's ranking up from 23rd to 15th in the state. To do that, he said the district will need to improve its instructional practices as well as the climate and culture within its schools.\nBefore taking on the role of interim superintendent, Thompson served as the district's assistant superintendent. Thompson previously served as assistant principal and principal of Mace's Lane Middle School.\nBoard President Mike Diaz said in a news release the board was fortunate to attract \"well-qualified candidates\" to the open position, but Thompson \"stood out as the best fit.\"\n\"The entire board looks forward to working alongside Dr. Thompson to ensure that all Dorchester County children have the opportunity to reach their full potential,\" Diaz said.\nThompson's official start date as superintendent is July 1. According to the news release, the board will vote to approve Thompson's contract at its regular meeting Thursday.\nThompson said he is \"all about the students\" and wants to ensure the district is producing kids that can compete in all fields at a national and global level.\n\"Right now I don't think we've done too good of a job of that,\" he said. \"So we've got room to grow, and that's what we plan on doing over the next five years.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And to me it seems like our special ed staff has been pretty flat.\n\"It doesn't seem like we are really as a county growing with the student need proportionally.\"\nAdditional recommendations presented by Mentges included the addition of a special education supervisor and four additional instructional assistants \"to support young students with more significant disabilities.\"\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the next step would be setting up a work session next month to lay out special education data and indicate areas to improve upon. Henry requested that in the future, a work session be scheduled prior to the approval of the staffing plan, to which the board and Pepukayi agreed.\n\"I would like to continue this conversation,\" Jackson said. \"A yes vote from me tonight does not mean a 'check this box, let's talk about it next year.' If we could continue this conversation at a more frequent pace, that would be fantastic.\"\nENROLLMENT STEADY\nKevin Shafer, Talbot County Public Schools' director of operations, presented enrollment projects reviewed by the Maryland Department of Planning. Numbers are steady and no schools were marked to be overutilized.\n\"TCPS remains in a relatively comfortable position related to our overall utilization across all facilities,\" Shafer said. He signaled housing development, demographic shifts and the state's education plan \u2014 Blueprint for Maryland's Future \u2014 as potential as areas of uncertainty in regards to enrollment and facility needs.\nEaston High peaked around 93% facility utilization last year, according to how large of an enrollment it could support, but Shafer said that percent will drop in years to come. All other percents came in under 90%, with Tilghman Elementary at a district-low 57% last year.\nShafer was asked by the board which school may be next in line for renovations after Chapel District Elementary School's upcoming expansion. He said Easton High School would be next, even if it's not needed the most.\n\"We would look at the state facility assessment data and use the data in order to make an informed decision on what makes more sense,\" Shafer said. \"The truth of the matter is that Easton Middle School is probably in a greater need for a renovation, but unfortunately state funding is dependent on the age of the building. \u2026 We have some years yet before we would qualify for funding.\" \n\n ",

    "content": "Dorchester school board Vice President Susan Morgan resigns\n\n June 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 860\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Susan Morgan, Dorchester County Board of Education vice president and former president, has resigned. Morgan made the announcement on Friday following a contentious vote and discussion during Thursday's school board meeting.Morgan said she also is withdrawing from running for reelection on the November ballot.\nAt the Thursday, June 13, meeting fractures in board member relationships were apparent.\nMorgan was the sole vote in favor of keeping the contract with Vision Quest, an alternative education program for district high schoolers that has been met with criticism from residents since it was approved in September.\nOver three years, this would have cost the district more than $3.3 million \u2014 one of the primary reasons other members voted against the contract. Morgan advocated for the program, citing seven students who graduated this year who otherwise would not have.\nThis vote was not the only reason Morgan decided to resign, she said in an interview with the Dorchester Star. \"My decision,\" she said, \"[came] when I saw the direction the people appointed by the County Council \u2014 not elected by the people \u2014 have chosen to take.\"\nMorgan referred to appointed members, Chris Wheedleton and Tabilah Chikwendu, who filled vacancies on the board this year.\nAt the June 13 meeting, board member Wheedleton called out the board for not being more collaborative.\nThe accusation came 10 days after the Board of Education voted to approve the proposed fiscal year 2025 budget at a meeting where Wheedleton was absent. At that meeting, the board acknowledged the challenges of passing a balanced budget and interim Superintendent Jymil Thompson talked about the \"fiscal cliff\" that is coming with COVID-19-related funding nearing an end.\nWheedleton, who was not at the June 3 meeting due to a work conflict, said he was shocked when he found out the budget had been approved. Wheedleton brought this up at the meeting Thursday, calling out board leadership, revealing fractures within the board.\n\"I'm now convinced, after a year on the board, that one of the biggest challenges in DCPS, if not the biggest, is this board,\" he said. \"I am part of that, so I am partly to blame. I have failed in bringing people together, and I need to be part of whatever solutions we find.\"\nWheedleton said he hates to have to make statements like this.\n\"This does not feel collaborative, and it feels divisive,\" he said. \"But this experience and the culture of this board currently matches that.\"\nThompson, whose four-year superintendent contract beginning July 1 was unanimously approved at the start of the meeting, asked that everyone work together.\n\"Because if this is the reality, if we don't get better, if we don't work together, we're going to still be sitting at 23 in five years,\" he said. \"That's a guarantee.\"\nSince becoming interim superintendent in March, Thompson has talked about the need to increase the district's ranking from 23rd in the state. At the meeting, he said the district will be using the hashtag #23nomore this year. There are 24 school districts in Maryland, one in each of the 23 counties plus Baltimore City.\nThompson talked about the importance of seeing one's role in the district as bigger than themself.\n\"I'll say it 1,000 times,\" he said. \"I'm the superintendent, but the job's not about me. It's much bigger. And that's what I want to keep the focus on, the most important people. And that's our kids.\"\nIn an interview Saturday afternoon with the Dorchester Star, Morgan said that crafting the fiscal year 2025 budget \u2014 the budget approved in Wheedleton's absence \u2014 was difficult for the board. Losing COVID-era funding and having to decide whether to continue to fund hires made during the COVID-19 pandemic was a tough decision.\nIn addition to funding Vision Quest \u2014 a need Morgan saw as a paramount to creating a good alternative school program \u2014 the safety of teachers, their pay and the performance of students have always been forefront in her decision-making, she said.\nGoing through expense reports for the past three fiscal years, Morgan said she was \"simply amazed at what was spent.\" In that deep dive, Morgan said they discovered \"rampant misspending with no real controls or oversight.\"\nWhile the board enacted a freeze on spending and hiring was only approved for those positions that opened due to attrition, Morgan said she thinks this year's budget \"might be saved, but it won't be known for a while yet.\"\nThe contract for Vision Quest was fair, Morgan said, reiterating the need for an alternative program for the fall \u2014 one that will benefit the students as much as Morgan witnessed first-hand with the success of Vision Quest.\nMorgan said when the \"surprise\" vote on Vision Quest was made, and she saw her fellow members voting to eliminate the program \"without anything other than hearsay\" she knew her opportunity to influence the board for the betterment of Dorchester County students was not to be.\nMorgan's term was set to expire in December. She had filed earlier to run against Christine LaMonica in the general election to retain her District 3 seat on the board. Saturday, she said she is no longer running for reelection.\nSchool board President Mike Diaz said he would have a statement about the situation on Wednesday. \n\n Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Along with Wheedleton, board members Talibah Chikwendu and Sheri Hubbard voted in favor of terminating the contract. Board Vice President Susan Morgan voted against termination, and board President Mike Diaz abstained from the vote and stayed silent during the discussion, as his wife is employed at Vision Quest.\nAccording to the contract, either party can terminate the agreement by providing written notice at least 180 days before the termination date. Under the agreement, Dorchester County Public Schools paid Vision Quest $93,363 per month for:\nIn-school services \u2014 such as psycho-educational groups, anger management and conflict resolution \u2014 for up to 10 students at any given time.Voluntary off-campus educational and behavioral support services at Vision Quest's Morningstar Youth Academy facility in Woolford for up to 16 students at any given time.Family functional therapy services for up to 10 DCPS families at any given time.\nOver three years, this would have cost the district over $3.3 million.\nBefore the vote, Wheedleton said he had multiple conversations with constituents about Vision Quest. He said the contract should be terminated because it is \"fiscally irresponsible\" and he believes Vision Quest has violated its contract with DCPS by not providing monthly reports.\n\"I, as a board member, have only seen two reports this year on progress,\" he said, adding that he doesn't think those reports have actually demonstrated progress.\nWheedleton said he believes there needs to be alternative education options for students, but this current agreement is not in the district's best interest.\nMorgan \u2014 who said she had been to Morningstar Youth Academy in Woolford and talked with parents of the students in the program \u2014 asked Wheedleton if he had visited the facility. He said he had not because that is not his job as a board member.\nMorgan said there were seven district students who graduated this year that wouldn't have if they had \"stayed on the path they were on.\"\n\"You have no idea what would have happened to those students if they had been in our schools supported by another program,\" Wheedleton said in response.\nMorgan said DCPS has tried other alternative education programs that have been unsuccessful. She said the school system won't have enough time to put another program in place before school starts in the fall.\nWheedleton said he believes the district's executive team has time to form a new agreement for an alternative education program.\n\"It's a three-year contract,\" Morgan said. \"And if you want to break the contract and you think you have the reasons, then you've made the vote.\"\nChikwendu said she didn't believe the Vision Quest contract is in the best interest of DCPS students. She said she has based that on information from people who have gone to the facility, from people who have seen the program inside schools and from the Vision Quest reports that the schools have received.\nHubbard said she voted to terminate the contract due to the \"numerous, numerous complaints\" she has received about Vision Quest as well as a conversation she had with a former Vision Quest staff member about the conditions. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-06-21",
    "author": "Bridget Lang Capital News Service",
    "content": "Mothers of Baltimore: Local women try to overcome lack of child care\n\n June 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bridget Lang Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 903\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Many child care centers in Baltimore tend to cater to single mothers, requiring the center operators, often based in the neighborhood, to provide ample doses of empathy and flexibility to support young families.\"You have the single parent [and the] other parent is either locked up or incarcerated,\" said Yvonne Turner, who owns Old Mother Hubbard's Child Care Center. \"They're trying to make ends meet.\"\nTurner started her own child care center with the hope of providing one-on-one time with children. \"I think it's so important that a child knows that you are loved somewhere,\" said Turner, who home-schooled her own children for most of their childhood.\nInterviews with several neighborhood-based child care centers in Baltimore reveal operators who emphasize their role in caring for the entire community and supporting young parents.\n\"I just be trying to help all of them that I run across and talk to them,\" said LaKesha Solomon, owner of Solomon's Family Daycare near Ellwood Park. \"They always say 'we're coming to the daycare lady', so I know a lot of them,\" Solomon said. \"I love my area.\"\nSolomon has been in the neighborhood for 25 years, but she credits the network in the neighborhood for supporting both parents and providers. For example, if someone is unable to afford daycare or access government-provided childcare vouchers, people will step up to cover the cost, according to Solomon.\n\"If they see somebody without [vouchers], they say, 'Take 'em up there to Ms. Kesha; fill out her paperwork and we'll talk to her,'\" Solomon said. These vouchers are provided by the Child Care Scholarship Program, which offers vouchers redeemable at participating child care centers to families who meet program requirements, like being below a minimum income threshold.\nAccording to Census data, there were 35,285 women-owned day care centers in the United States in 2021. In 2020, there were 793 registered child care providers in Baltimore City. In 2024, there are now only 669, a 15.6% loss since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Maryland State Department of Education data. In Baltimore, there are a variety of child care centers run out of family homes by women, such as Latoya Turpin, who runs the newly established Little Steps Childcare out of her house in Southwest Baltimore.\nTurpin said she had worked in other day care centers, but now as an owner she sought to create something different. Turpin said the focus of other day care centers she worked at \"wasn't about the children, honestly. I feel like they cared more about the money than the quality of child care that the children were getting.\"\nTurpin's child care prioritizes curriculum and development, while also keeping the parents in the loop through an app called Brightwheel. The app allows parents to learn what their child is doing at any time during the day via posts and updates from Turpin, such as the time of a nap or that they have eaten.\nTurpin's sense of community appealed to Jillian Kumar, a single mother raising a 1-year-old girl, Wynter. Kumar called Turpin, who immediately answered the phone, answered her questions and set up a time to look at the day care. Finding Little Steps Childcare was a gift, she said.\n\"It was all very easy, which as a new mom, single mom in over her head it was very nice that I didn't have to, you know, jump through a bunch of hoops,\" Kumar said.\nKumar's struggles as a single mother in Baltimore are not uncommon. The Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance-Jacob France Institute shows 51% of female-headed households in Baltimore have children under the age of 18. Some of the challenges for Kumar and other new parents involve delays in accessing child care vouchers, which in turn delayed her ability to return to work. And this added stress on her family, who had to babysit her daughter.\nThere are also complications from urban life in general. Kumar said her car was stolen twice after she had given birth and that her car seat and stroller were also stolen. Her neighbors, however, came to assist her.\n\"The community really came around for me in that time of need,\" Kumar said. \"I was able to get a car seat and stroller for free that was in amazing condition, and was actually the one that I had wanted when I first got pregnant but was unable to afford.\"\nNot all young parents have such support. Turner sees the stress single parents face, and some of these parents search for an outlet, which she said can be drugs. These parents are \"trying to duck reality and, and cope. That's their coping mechanism,\" Turner said. Some parents turn to smoking so much marijuana \"that their children come in smelling like marijuana,\" Turner said.\nOther parents said these neighborhood-run and owned day care centers help ease worries about the safety of their children.\n\"There's a lot of people out here who don't really care for the kids. They just care about the money,\" said Kieshe Gasque, a client of Turpin's Little Steps Childcare. Gasque said other child care centers are \"not taking care of them the proper way\" such as failing to change diapers. Having her children in the care of a quality person such as Turpin is an enormous relief, Gasque said.\n\"So it's the simple fact of knowing that your child is in good hands,\" Gasque said. \"And you can go on with your workday or your life without thinking, 'Oh my god, is this person harming my child?'\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS \u2014 On Friday morning, over two hundred educators enjoyed a day of appreciation at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum's second annual Education Professionals Gratitude Day.This event invites anyone involved in education \u2014 teachers, administrators and support staff \u2014 to enjoy free admission to the museum for themselves and their families.\nJill Ferris, vice president of education and interpretation for the museum, said the idea for this event came from witnessing educators' hard work and dedication during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"It's part of our Your museum, Your community initiative just to welcome and recognize all of the effort that's going on within our community and be a support and part of that,\" Ferris said. \"... We wanted a way to recognize that incredible effort that went on.\"\nThe Maritime Museum explores and preserves the history, environment and culture of the entire Chesapeake Bay region through interactive exhibits, recreational activities, and the preservation of historic buildings and boats.\nFerris, a former eighth-grade social studies teacher, said the museum works with teachers and educators year-round by coordinating field trips, speaker programs and summer camps. She said the museum's goal is to connect people to the Chesapeake Bay and find ways to meet people's different needs.\nEducators came from nationwide to explore the 18-acre campus Friday. Included in the activities provided for educators was a musical performance by duo Fresh Squeezed OJ, free shaved ice from Kona Ice, a visit from the Phillips Wharf Fishmobile and free Harbor Highlights cruises.\nAmong the attendees were Mia Alvarez and Michelle McDaniel, elementary school teachers who came down to St. Michaels from Pennsylvania.\nAlvarez said museums and teachers work well together because teachers learn exciting history while observing their students.\n\"I love how interactive it is here,\" Alvarez said. \"Like just right now, we were trying to collect the eels. We love how hands-on it is. It's amazing.\"\nFerris noted that teachers guide their students throughout the year, help them grow and are genuinely trying to help them achieve. Educators want to diversify learning experiences outside of rigorous testing.\nAccording to McDaniel, museums often elevate the student learning experience by connecting what they learn in the classroom to a real world scenario. Ferris said it is a delight to work with schools and help make learning come alive for the students. She said it is wonderful to be able to come together and support educators and celebrate the work they do.\nMcDaniel said it's incredible when the community celebrates the hard work that educators do during the school year. She said museums are excellent for teachers, and the two go well together in educating the next generation.\n\"It's great because teachers are always learning,\" McDaniel said. \"We always want to learn more. So the more resources we can get access to, I think it's amazing because if you do things like this, teachers will show up. They want to learn more. They want to see where they can bring their kids.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Wearing hoods, having cellphones on are not allowed in Calvert schools\n\n June 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARTY MADDEN mmadden@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 480\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When Calvert County's next school year begins in August something will be missing from students' heads \u2014 hoods.In finalizing the revised code of conduct for Calvert County Public Schools, a majority of school board members voted to forbid students from wearing hoods in the school building.\nAfter making her motion to enact the hood prohibition, board member Lisa Grenis clarified that students could still wear hooded sweatshirts in school but the hoods must be off the heads.\nGrenis cited a recent 12-question survey submitted to educators that drew nearly 1,300 responses, with a strong majority favoring the ban.\nIn lobbying for a policy change, Grenis has stated that some students are wearing the hoods up to conceal earbuds, thus ignoring classroom instruction or evading recognition by teachers and administrators in the event of a disruptive situation.\nLarry Titus, the school system's school safety specialist, confirmed the difficulty in positively identifying a student whose image is captured on surveillance camera if a hood conceals his or her head.\n\"I've been told there's many reasons why kids want to wear hoods and it's not all nefarious,\" board member Dawn Balinski said. \"Sometimes it's because you're having a bad hair day.\"\nCecilia Lewis, director of student services, who was advised by a large committee on the code of conduct rewrite, confirmed that there can be special instances where \"the preservation of a student's dignity\" is taken into consideration. Students must be proactive in seeking that preservation, Lewis indicated.\n\"We're not removing all things worn on the head,\" Grenis said. \"We're removing one thing.\"\nAttending her first meeting as the student member of the board, Grace Minakowski stated, \"I don't think that banning hoods addresses the underlying issues of students vaping and students getting into fights. It concerns me that we're not looking towards why are students getting into fights and why are students vaping. We're just going for the quick grab \u2014 'let's ban hoods.'\"\nMinakowski was allowed to vote on Grenis' motion and cast the lone vote against the modification to the code of conduct change regarding hoods. Board president Antoine White and board vice president Inez Claggett opted to abstain.\nThe board then voted unanimously to approve the complete revised code of conduct.\nEarlier this spring, the board discussed changes to the policy regarding electronic and communication devices. Those changes were included in the newly adopted code of conduct.\nThe change stated, \"Students may bring cellular phones to school but are not permitted to bring other electronic or communication devices, such as personal laptops, because Calvert County Public Schools provides laptops to students in grades 3-12 and iPads for students in grades pre-k to 2.\"\nThe policy revision also addresses cellphone procedures.\n\"Students may bring their phone, but once school begins, the device must be powered off \u2014 not on vibrate or silent mode \u2014 and must remain in a non-visible, secure location with noted exceptions in high school,\" according to the policy.\nTwitter: @MartySoMdNews \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline Commissioners approve CCPS FY25 budget summary\n\n June 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 626\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 Although Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons told county commissioners Tuesday morning that increases in the cost of business are driving the district's fiscal year 2025 operating budget, he said the district feels that it is in a \"good spot\" when it comes to the budget.\"We feel like we're in a good spot, budget-wise, to move forward,\" he said about the $94.48 million balanced operating budget at a commissioners meeting on Tuesday.\nAt the meeting, the commissioners unanimously voted to approve the proposed CCPS budget summary, which the Caroline County Board of Education had approved at its work session last week.\nThe budget is an increase of nearly $4 million from the fiscal year 2024 budget. Simmons pointed to a $185,000 increase in miscellaneous revenue, interest revenue and non-resident tuition.\n\"We had a good year with interest revenue,\" he said.\nRevenue from the county totals $18.49 million, an increase of $2.4 million over the previous year, and revenue from the state totals $75 million, an increase of $1.38 million over the previous year.\nSimmons talked about rising expenditures, such as budget adjustments for Blueprint for Maryland's Future programs, a 5% increase in health insurance costs and increases due to the cost of doing business. Those cost of business increases include Maryland Association of Boards of Education insurance costs and transportation costs.\nWhen it comes to Blueprint programming, unrestricted career ladders and unrestricted transitional supplemental instruction \u2014 which had both previously been restricted \u2014 will cost the district $559,688.\nSimmons said teacher pension costs continue to increase a little every year.\nSimmons also talked about the need to fund positions that were previously funded through COVID-19-related Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funding and Maryland Leads grants, which will both expire in September. Those positions include a third assistant principal at North Caroline High School and three technology support positions so the district can continue to have those employees in each building.\n\"We've learned that having tech support in person available at every campus was a much better model than having a centralized model and literally sending people out to the buildings,\" Simmons said. \"The mileage was killing us.\"\nSimmons said the district was able to save money from salary lapse, which is when new employees that are hired to fill the positions of people retiring. Because the new hires often have less experience than their predecessors, their salaries aren't as high.\n\"So you get some savings there,\" Simmons said.\nAfter Simmons' presentation, commissioners asked questions related to the Blueprint, a state plan to improve student outcomes and the quality of education through increasing education funding by $3.8 billion over a 10 year period.\nCommission Vice President Larry Porter asked Simmons how close the district is to reaching a $60,000 starting salary for teachers, which districts must do by 2026, per the Blueprint.\nSimmons said starting teacher salaries for next year are over $55,000, and he believes the district will reach the $60,000 mandate by 2026.\nThere are two scales for teachers: the traditional scale and the career ladder. The career ladder is a part of one of the five pillars of the Blueprint.\nTeachers on the career ladder are encouraged to pursue National Board Certification, which is a process that teaches teachers to reflect on their craft. An expenditure of $70,000 in the fiscal year 2025 operating budget will go toward increasing salaries for teachers who receive that certification.\nSimmons said the district will reach the $60,000 salary minimum by 2026 for teachers who are on the career ladder, but not for teachers on the traditional scale. He said current teachers have the option to stay on the traditional scale or move onto the career ladder.\n\"But all new hired staff will start on the career ladder,\" he said. \"So that will be the scale that we get to ($60,000).\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This includes prepayments and covering for anticipated overages.\nJones asked for approval to transfer $75,000 to student services, in part for prepayments on software, and $500,000 to transportation to prepay upcoming bus lease payments.\nThe district also asked to transfer $600,000 to fixed charges for other postemployment benefits contributions and health insurance prepayments.\n\"We're just trying to make headway there because we're very far behind on that liability,\" Jones said of the benefits payments.\nTo balance the budget, Jones requested that savings from three categories \u2014 instructional salaries, special education and interfund transfer to capital projects \u2014 be used to transfer the funds. Notably, there was $850,000 saved in instructional salaries.\n\"Whenever we're transferring out of instructional salaries, it always raises an eyebrow,\" Council Vice President Pete Lesher said. \"Because of course that savings comes from vacant positions.\"\n\" \u2026 I'm curious what the plan is to fill those positions for the coming years so that we don't see that loss in direct student contact,\" Lesher said.\nJones said the district has a director of recruitment and retention. She also mentioned that having mentors for teachers has been \"very helpful for retention of newly-hired staff.\"\n\"I think a little bit of the savings are a reflection of us having grant availability this year,\" Jones added. \" \u2026 If money frees up in a grant and it's appropriate to charge a teacher or part of a teacher salary, we're going to use that money.\"\n\"It's comforting to know that you're being intentional about ensuring that those positions will get filled,\" Lesher said. \" \u2026 The success of the schools is one of our most powerful economic development tools. When the schools succeed, it helps all the other businesses, everybody else who's looking to hire in this community.\"\nThe council approved the request unanimously. \n\n Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He is heading to Brown University in Rhode Island this fall.\nThere, Loller plans to continue his studies in computer science, with a special interest in artificial intelligence.\nHe also plans to keep working on a web-based program and location transmission hardware to help parents track their students' school buses.\nLoller gave the Kent County Board of Education a sneak peek at his work Tuesday, May 28, showing the members lines of code and the user interface and speaking about how it all came about.\n\"Online I found some nice styling formats, so that will make the website look prettier,\" Loller said. \"This is a very fun project to work on.\"\nLoller served this past school year as a member of the Board of Education's Citizen Advisory Committee.\nIt was during on those committee meetings that the question was raised about the school system getting an app that allowed parents to track their children's buses.\nLoller agreed with the value of such a program, but also recognized the financial constraints school systems face.\nSo, he set about to tackle the project himself, writing line after line of code.\nKaren Couch, then superintendent of Kent County Public Schools, said Loller approached her following that Citizen Advisory Committee discussion, wanting to take a shot at writing such a program.\n\"After that (meeting, Ben came up to me and he was so excited,\" Couch said. \"I just have such high praise for what he is doing.\"\nLoller worked with William Poore, Kent County Public Schools' supervisor of information technology, as part of the Makerspace program at Kent County High School and the coding team.\n\"As involved as Ben has been (in school) and with how much he takes on, he has worked tirelessly on this project,\" Poore said. \"I'm just incredibly proud of what he's accomplished.\"\nLoller's mother was on hand for his presentation to the Board of Education, speaking about how much time he spends coding at home.\n\"He codes all night,\" Wendy Loller said. \"That's why I'm here, to see what he's been doing.\"\nBen Loller said he has taken the code and equipment on successful test drives. He has reviewed privacy concerns and is incorporating the necessary safeguards.\nMembers of the Board of Education and the audience, impressed by Ben Loller's progress, encouraged him repeatedly to copyright his work.\n\"And you've got to come with a cool name,\" board member Trish McGee told him. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And I'm still here.\"\nDiaz said he wanted to make sure he left the board and the management of the board \"in good hands and on good footing\" before resigning, and he felt that had been accomplished when he resigned Friday.\nDiaz' resignation comes on the heels of Board Vice President Susan Morgan's resignation in mid-June.\nMorgan announced her resignation one day after a board meeting that broadcast fractures in board member relationships. At the meeting, Board Member Chris Wheedleton called out board leadership and said the culture of the board felt \"divisive\" rather than collaborative.\nDiaz said his health was the only reason for his resignation.\n\"Every board or council or what have you has its moments,\" he said. \"People trying to work together and find a common path. And (my resignation) has nothing to do with anything other than when I fell ill in February.\"\nWith neither a president nor vice president, the board is planning to have a special meeting next week where an election for a president and vice president will be held, said DCPS communications and community outreach specialist Valerie Goff.\nAlthough the board is currently down two members, the remaining three members make up the minimum number of members needed to hold a meeting, or a quorum.\nThe Dorchester County Council is in charge of making appointments to vacant Board of Education seats. Monday morning, Goff said the county had been made aware of Diaz's resignation. She said the district is waiting to hear how soon the county is planning to move and what it is planning to do.\nGoff said she does not know how far along the council is in appointing Morgan's seat.\n\"The important thing for Dorchester County Public Schools is focusing on the upcoming school year,\" Goff said. \"These resignations will be dealt with by the County Council, and we'll await and hear from them. But we're busy here getting ready to push out the next school year.\"\nNOVEMBER ELECTION\nBefore submitting their resignations, both Diaz and Morgan were running for reelection in District 1 and District 3, respectively.\nDorchester County Board of Elections Program Manager Kim Jones said Morgan has already withdrawn from the election and her name will not appear on the ballot for the general election in November.\nDiaz, who received the second highest number of votes in his district in the May primary, has not decided if he will withdraw from the election. He said he doesn't know what the future holds and it is something he will have to discuss with his family.\nIf Diaz chooses to withdraw from the election, his name will also be removed from the ballot as long as he withdraws before the ballots are proofed in August, Jones said.\nDiaz said he wishes nothing but the best to the board and recently appointed Superintendent Jymil Thompson.\n\"As with anything, I hope that (the board) stays aligned with the common goals that we have set forth,\" he said. \"And that's retaining teachers and providing good alternative education programs and school safety. ... Those are things that are going to make good school systems.\"\nThis report may be updated. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Finding childcare in Maryland is hard. Finding good childcare is even harder\n\n July 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KHUSHBOO RATHORE Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 2331\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When Stephanie Jovine searched for child care for her nearly 4-year-old daughter LuzMarie in Prince George's County in 2015, she found two options, both of them bad.Jovine couldn't afford the first one, and the second denied the young girl snacks and then sheets for sleeping.\n\"I was so upset, you know, it was so hard to trust anyone,\" said Jovine, a teacher in the District of Columbia Public Schools at the time.\nAfter six months of searching, Jovine found a grandmother who ran a small before-and-after care service, LiLi's Child Care Center, in Temple Hills. The times the program was open aligned perfectly with Jovine's needs.\n\"She's a godsend, for real,\" said Jovine, who's now 33.\nJovine's arduous search for child care is not unique \u2014 and it would not even be her last search. Interviews with several Maryland families showed that while finding child care is hard, finding a facility that fits a family's needs and budget is even harder.\nMaryland offers a rating system to help parents select the right child care facility, but providers say the rating system is difficult to navigate. Most parents interviewed by the Local News Network said they never looked at the state rating system.\nSimilarly, the state offers a generous scholarship program to help pay for child care, but providers complain they often have to wait months for the state to pay for child care for those scholarship recipients. Parents like Jovine struggle with the scholarship program, too.\nThe complications of finding child care in Maryland often leave families waiting for a place for their child, and that can lead to trouble, said Doug Lent, communications director for Maryland Family Network, which helps parents find child care and helps providers manage their businesses.\n\"When you're on that waiting list, that's when you're more likely to be tempted to rely on unlicensed care, unregulated care, and get into a situation that's maybe not safe or maybe not high quality,\" Lent said.\nThe ratings dilemma\nLinda Garey woke up at 6 a.m. on a springtime Saturday at her home in Dundalk to create a communication board for the autistic children she cares for daily in her home. Eleven hours later, she was still working on the project. She isn't paid for the time she spends preparing her classroom.\nGarey is a level-3 provider with Maryland EXCELS, the child care quality rating system in the state that offers a top rating of 5. Garey created a 65-page handbook outlining her teaching philosophy. She also assists other programs with their handbooks.\n\"I've typed probably about 20 to 30 handbooks and turned them in for other people, right? And they're all level 5,\" she said.\nEXCELS is an optional program for licensed child care providers. It offers them training and guidance and, if they qualify for it, a rating that parents can refer to when choosing a place to care for their child.\nThe Maryland EXCELS rating is based on five categories: licensing, staff qualifications, accreditation, developmentally appropriate practices and administrative policies. The highest overall rating a facility can get is the lowest rating it gets in any of those five categories.\nAnd even though Garey has more than 20 years of experience, her lack of national accreditation as a child care provider means she can't go higher than level 3.\nGarey is working on getting her child development associate credential and becoming accredited \u2014 but she won't be submitting that information to Maryland EXCELS. She said whenever she submits new documents and information to the Maryland State Department of Education, it goes to waste.\n\"'I turned in some information about 20 times and it was denied,\" she said.\nState officials insist they are trying to help. Jena Smith, the director of quality improvement initiatives at the state's Division of Early Childhood, said quality assurance specialists work with each child care facility to improve its quality rating.\nThe Maryland State Department of Education also publishes a provider toolkit that outlines the documents necessary to rise up the ratings ladder, Smith said. The requirements for each level build on the last, she said.\n\"It's a scaffold, and so that's really how our quality assurance specialists work with our programs,\" Smith said. \"They help them assess where they currently are and where they want to go.\"\nSince January 2020, the number of level-5 providers in Maryland has increased by 9.6%, according to state statistics retrieved by the Local News Network. However, 15 of the state's 24 jurisdictions have lost level-5 providers, and providers overall appear to have mixed feelings about the EXCELS program.\nAsked to rate the EXCELS program's effectiveness on a 1-to-5 scale, with 1 being least effective and 5 being most effective, the 256 child care providers who replied to a Local News Network survey gave the program an average rating of 3.\n\"I answered 3 because part of the program, I feel, has been extremely helpful, such as writing policies for guidance (on) nutrition and such,\" Cheryl Thomsen, a child care provider in Salisbury, wrote in her survey response. \"I did obtain accreditation but found it was very difficult to actually follow all the requirements properly on a daily basis.\"\nA difficult search\nJovine moved from Prince George's County to Waldorf, in Charles County, in 2020 and left teaching. Two years later, she returned to the District of Columbia Public Schools system while pregnant with her second child \u2014 only to discover searching for child care was still difficult and time-consuming.\n\"I was looking and looking and looking for child care,\" she said.\nJovine experienced exactly what other young mothers have experienced in recent years. She went on a frantic search for child care without referring to the state's EXCELS ratings.\nPriya Mahfooz's son Zakir was born in May 2019. She sent Zakir to a child care facility near the family home in Clarksburg, in Montgomery County, a few months later. But that operation shut down at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, never to reopen.\nDesperate for child care, Mahfooz and a friend banded together to hire the teacher who ran that closed facility to look after their children. Each family paid the teacher $425 a week.\nIn the summer of 2021, Mahfooz decided to send Zakir back to a child care facility. During her search, Mahfooz said, she didn't rely on Maryland EXCELS or the state inspection reports.\n\"When you're searching, it's really just whatever you're being fed in your feeds,\" Mahfooz said. \"You're thinking about price, location, (online) ratings.\"\nMahfooz found a child care slot for Zakir later that summer in Germantown and then enrolled him in Green Valley Montessori School in September 2021.\nMeanwhile, Javiera King, an administrator at the University of Maryland, had to hire a nanny to take care of her young daughter, Layla, while the family searched for a slot in a child care facility.\nWhile pregnant, \"I had to put myself on a waitlist already because most day cares have a waitlist a year out,\" she said.\nKing's nanny gave her two weeks notice in December 2023. That meant King had to quickly piece together a schedule where family members took turns caring for her daughter, who was 11 months old at the time. The family then found a child care facility that had a part-time slot for Layla, meaning the family's piecemeal plan for caring for the young girl would continue.\nFinally, in February, Layla's part-time slot at that facility became full-time.\n\"We were really lucky with how everything played out for us,\" King said.\nJovine wasn't so lucky. When she was five months pregnant with her second child, she called 12 child care facilities. All of them had a waiting list of a year or more for infants.\nHer daughter Lily was born at the end of February 2023, and Jovine finished the school year on maternity leave. She had to go back to work in August, but the earliest availability at most nearby child care facilities was in October.\n\"There was one spot that had an availability. I wasn't too satisfied with it,\" Jovine said.\nThere were few toys and learning tools. The outdoor play equipment was dirty and the facility had no curriculum for promoting development in infants, Jovine said.\nShe found another option on a billboard. Jovine called that facility and when she found they had a spot, she took it. She only took three days off work to care for Lily.\nThe facility Jovine sent Lily to after a 10-month search is enrolled in the EXCELS program but is not yet rated.\nAsked if she referred to the EXCELS system during her search, Jovine said she didn't even know about the state rating system at the time.\nJovine has seen her daughter develop significantly at the day care. Lily is happy to go and a little reluctant to leave in the evenings, Jovine said.\n\"This is how I know she's in good hands. She likes it there,\" she said.\nA scholarship program\nIn addition to offering ratings of the state's child care providers, Maryland expanded its child care scholarship program in 2022, making it easier to afford child care, said Heather Harding, coordinator at the Federalsburg Judy Center in Caroline County.\nBut providers said the scholarship program doesn't work as well in practice as it does in theory.\nThe eligibility requirements for the scholarship program allow middle class families to apply. Any family of two making less than $61,222 per year is eligible; for a family of four, the limit is $104,438.\nA new fast-track program, launched on July 1, 2023, aims to reduce the wait time for parents to receive approval for a scholarship. Three days after applying, eligible families can get 60 days of child care paid for while their long-term aid application is processed. Scholarship values each year can range from $9,000 to $25,000 per child.\nLent, of the Maryland Family Network, said the new fast-track has vastly improved the scholarship program. Previously, parents would be placed on a waiting list to receive help with their child care expenses, he said.\nBut other requirements can make the system a catch-22, Harding said. Parents are required to be enrolled in school or working to be eligible for the scholarship, she said. But many of them can't do either unless they have child care guaranteed.\n\"Even if they find it, then they can't pay for it till they get the scholarship,\" Harding said.\nThese scholarships can only be used in facilities that are enrolled in the EXCELS program. After parents receive a voucher from the state, they present it to the provider. The provider then has to send paperwork to the state in order to be paid.\nGarey, the child care provider from Dundalk, said this is one of the most frustrating parts about the process. Multiple times, she filed paperwork and had to wait three months to be paid. At one point, the state owed her $15,000 in scholarship pay. This happened after the state moved to an advance-payment system that was supposed to provide providers with income more quickly.\n\"It's this delay after delay after delay,\" Garey said.\nShe finds ways to deal with the months-late payments because she refuses to make the parents pay or to drop families from her list of clients.\n\"One little girl is nonverbal. She sang and pointed to every single letter of the alphabet,\" Garey said. \"I did that. So why in the world would I drop that family?\"\nOther providers also complain about late scholarship payments. Christine Morris, the director of Trinity Lutheran Christian School and Early Learning Center in Joppa, in Harford County, said this spring that the state owed her $40,000 in scholarship payments. And Shantel Rouzer, who runs Happy Feet Enrichment Childcare Center in Baltimore City, said she turned away students on the scholarship program because she knows the state's reimbursements will come so late.\n\"It's not the families' fault, but (Maryland State Department of Education officials) don't hear us!!!?? And providers are tired!!!\" Rouzer wrote in response to a survey from the Local News Network.\nSolving her own problem\nParents like Jovine don't always know about the scholarship program. When she found out about the program in February, months after Lily, her youngest daughter, started day care, Jovine applied. A day later, the program's new fast-track program started temporarily covering her child care costs for two months.\n\"It took a huge load, And it's amazing to have that option,\" she said.\nBefore that, Jovine was paying $1,360 per month for child care for Lily. On top of that, she had to provide snacks, milk, lunch and other resources to the center.\nBut four days before Jovine's temporary aid expired, she hadn't gotten a final decision from the state. Jovine didn't receive a response until June. By then, she was already paying out of pocket.\nShe'll have to continue to do so because the state decided she was earning too much money to qualify. Noting her application listed extra money from her old job at D.C. Public Schools that doesn't reflect what she's making now, she has reapplied.\nJovine and her longtime partner, Abdul Dopson, now need child care more than ever. Their third child, Mia, was born on June 14.\nKnowing infant spots are difficult to find, Jovine decided to leave her teaching job \u2014 and do her own small part to alleviate Maryland's child care shortage.\n\"I got licensed to start a day care myself: a home day care,\" she said. \"The need is that prevalent, you know, I might as well try to open up a day care myself and see what happens.\"\nJovine's fledgling child care facility, Elite Kidz Clubhouse, opens in August \u2014 but it's already overtaken her home's living room and dining room. She's spent more than $2,500 on cots, desks, developmentally appropriate toys and other necessities.\nA large, colorful tree painted on the wall of the facility showcases the skills Jovine wants her students to get out of their day-to-day activities. Jovine said she wants her facility to work its way through the EXCELS system and eventually qualify as a preschool under the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education reform plan.\n\"Why not start this beautiful generation how it should, educating them and giving them what they need to be successful little children?\" she said.\nLocal News Network reporter Laura Shaughnessy contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Young author presents local bird guide to Horizons students\n\n July 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Andrea Grabenstein agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Life \n \n 743\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Encouraging fellow youths to learn about their local feathered friends, Xaviana Leis, 13, of Edgewater presented her authored and illustrated \"Maryland Bird Guide\" to Horizons of Kent and Queen Anne's students at the Gunston School June 25.Preventing summer learning from going to the birds, this season's Horizons summer program focus is all about birds with high-flying fun. Last week's presenter, Leis shared her knowledge about birds and her experiences as a raptor volunteer and what others can do to support their environment.\nHorizons of Kent and Queen Anne's programs seek to prevent \"summer slide\" and provide engaging educational opportunities and events for under-resourced students, according to Emily Murphy, executive director.\nThis season's theme focuses all on birds and in addition to regular Horizons activities, this summer students are diving into what it means to be a good steward of the environment and strengthen an appreciation for wildlife, Murphy said.\nThroughout the summer the students will engage in high-flying activities including bird watching and building an osprey nest, Murphy said.\nIn keeping with this season's theme, Horizons was excited to welcome Leis, who at the age of 11, authored and illustrated her book \"Maryland Bird Guide\".\nA homeschool student in Edgewater and member of Girl Scout 11023, her passion for birds grew when a rehabilitator with Owl Moon Raptor Center came to present to her troop, she said.\nSoon, Leis was volunteering herself at Owl Moon along with her mother, and was captivated by the world of local birds, she said.\nWriting and illustrating the self-published \"Maryland Bird Guide\" as part of a Girl Scout Bronze Star Award when she was 11, Leis seeks to continually educate her community on the wonders of local birds and spread messages about how to help these amazing creatures.\n\"I wanted to do something that would inspire others to learn more about birds and how they can help them,\" she said.\nSome species of birds like crows are extremely intelligent and can remember the actions of humans that are nice to them and those who aren't so nice, Leis said. Crows also use human tools to their advantage, such as leaving nuts in the road to be cracked by passing cars and then hopping into the road when the traffic light turns red.\nContrary to popular belief, bread is not a suitable food to feed ducks at the park, Leis said.\nBread has little nutritional value for ducks and uneaten bread can also form algae to gunk up the water. Better foods available in your kitchen to toss for ducks include fruit, uncooked oatmeal and rice. Frozen peas thawed by the time you get to the park also make a nice treat, she said.\nLeis also noted the impressive wingspan on several species of raptors that truly has to be seen to be believed.\nShe reiterated the importance of cleaning up litter for the benefit of keeping a natural habitat beautiful for all of us.\nAlso part of her Scout project, Leis built special tubes to properly dispose of discarded fishing line so it does not get tangled in unsuspecting wildlife.\nEveryone can do their part in helping wildlife this summer by picking up trash, including fishing line and disposing of it in proper receptacles.\nGoing into eighth grade this fall, her goal is to continually educate her community about wildlife.\nBirds are more than just pretty things to look at out your window, they are living creatures and helping birds thrive is a necessary part of the functioning ecosystem, Leis said. \"They are part of the environment and we need to help them.\"\n\"Maryland Guide to Birds\" includes over fifty different birds common to Maryland and nearby states alongside vibrant watercolor illustrations by Leis herself. The book contains a wingspan's worth of information including habitats, diet, size, and fun facts.\n\"You have the ability to make a difference even if you're younger. I want to show others they can have a cause they believe in,\" she said.\nReceiving signed copies of the bird guide, Horizons students were encouraged to \"go wild\" and use the book through the summer program to help identify local birds in the area.\nLeis self-published book is available on Amazon and all proceeds go toward Owl Moon. To date, Leis has raised over $10,000.\n\"It just feels incredible,\" she said.\nFree copies of \"Maryland Guide to Birds\" for groups are available by messaging the Girls Making The World A Better Place Facebook page, Dombi-Leis said.\nHorizons seeks to provide additional support and summer enrichment opportunities to underprivileged students.\nMore information about Horizons can be found at https://horizonskentqueenannes.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Milk cartons are now 55 cents each.\nMeal prices do not impact the number of students who would be eligible for free or reduced meals, Hickey said.\nIn other business it was noted, as it moves toward self operational food services, QACPS once again approved a piggybacking contract, this one a little more soft served.\nThe BOE approved a piggyback off Anne Arundel County Public Schools contract with Hershey Creamery Company for ice cream products and freezers.\nThis contract that other Maryland school districts are piggybacking off of is set to expire March 2025 and then QACPS will be able to piggyback off of Baltimore County Public Schools' bid through March 2028, Hickey said.\nThe fiscal impact will be $50,000 and funding will be out of the food service fund balance account, she said.\nQACPS currently sells Hershey's ice cream as an a la carte item.\nThe QACPS Board of Education will next meet July 17 at 6 p.m. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Stafford's long-time friend and former classmate Phil Feldman stopped by the learning center on July 2 to take a tour and hand current Executive Director Goldie Cooper a check for $25,000.\nFeldman, who made the donation in Stafford's honor, said he made the donation because he wants the center to be named after Stafford, who was New Beginnings' executive director for eight years.\nNow there are plans to rename the center \"Dr. Theresa Stafford's New Beginnings Learning Academy.\" Later this summer, the facility plans to hold a dedication event.\nFeldman said he hopes his donation benefits the kids that New Beginnings serves. He talked about the experiences that the nonprofit learning center provides children.\n\"It takes kids who are maybe not as fortunate as most and shows them parts of the world they (might have) never seen,\" he said.\nDuring his visit to New Beginnings on July 2, Feldman, along with his wife Marlene Feldman and grandchildren Andie and Claire, heard from staff and students of the learning center about the book they have been reading as a class. Students also told Feldman about some of the field trips they have gone on and activities they have tried out.\nRecently, the Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay donated golf clubs to New Beginnings so that children can practice their swings.\nMyche Smith, who started as a volunteer at New Beginnings and has now been employed there for two years, said the center rolled out its new STEM program this week. Throughout the day, different age groups can try out different activities in the new STEM Center within New Beginnings.\n\"The kids are going to enjoy it because STEM is all about having fun,\" Lee said. \"It's learning through fun.\"\nFeldman said he loved seeing the children work on their reading and writing skills during his visit.\n\"That'll take them as far as they want to go,\" he said.\nAlong with Feldman's donation, New Beginnings recently received $40,000 in grant awards, including a $10,000 grant from the John and Janice Wyatt Foundation to go toward a reading programming.\n\"Reading can be fun, it can be exciting,\" Lee said. \"It can open up a new world for you that you can't even imagine.\"\nLee does the bookkeeping and grant writing for New Beginnings. She said she has written $180,000 in grants, and the center has gotten about $72,000 in grant awards so far.\n\"And I'm still writing because I vowed to do $120,000 in grants,\" she said.\nLooking back on what her sister did for New Beginnings, Lee talked about how Stafford grew the learning center that now serves pre-K through seventh graders.\n\"She went from a $43,000 budget ... to over $185,000 a year to give these kids the best experiences she could give them,\" Lee said.\nLee said Stafford wanted kids \"to have the best education they could have in the best environment.\" She said kids don't always have the best home situations.\n\"But we can put them in the best learning situations they could be in,\" Lee said. \"So (Stafford) made sure that this place was outfitted to look like any other center in the world.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She is pursuing a master's degree in social work at Salisbury University.\n\"I've had such great opportunity to work with the community in my position in law enforcement (and) volunteer work,\" she said. \"I feel honored that I get this next part of my journey.\"\nLaMonica said she'd like to see \"much more involvement by our community ... in school decisions,\" adding that it's essential for the community and the board to truly know one another.\nSome of her top priorities include school safety, transparency, academic excellence, and support for educators.\n\"Both appointees stress that building a healthy and effective learning environment must have a strong foundation of safety, staff retention, evidence-based learning practices, collaboration, transparency, and accountability,\" said a Friday morning press release from the County Council.\nBoth Diaz and Morgan resigned from the Board of Education in June.\nDiaz resigned June 28, citing family and health concerns as the reason behind his resignation. In February, Diaz underwent a liver transplant. He said in an interview that resigning from the board was something he had been thinking of since becoming sick.\nMorgan resigned June 14. She resigned one day after a contentious Board of Education vote to terminate the district's contract with Vision Quest, an alternative education program for district high schoolers that has been met with criticism from residents since it was approved in September.\nThis report may be updated. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Stronger defense, improved education\n\n July 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 374\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Among American's top concerns going into the November election are inflation (the economy), illegal migration across our southern border and crime. These are all substantive worries; however, none of them seems likely to remain equally prominent forever. This is because they have been sufficiently elevated in public consciousness that politicians are being forced to pay more attention to them.There is reason to believe, in fact, that some corrective actions, if not all resolute, are already being taken. Less obvious on the public's radar warning screen, but longer term in nature, are questions regarding national defense and youth education. These, in my opinion, should be higher on our worry list than they are today.\nAs a result of relative public indifference neither of these issues seems to be getting serious attention from elected leaders.\nFor example, the latest proposed national defense budget mandates we will be spending less going forward in real terms on military readiness than several years ago. In addition, defense spending is or soon will be exceeded by interest payments on federal debt. This does not bode well for longer-term security at a time when our chief adversaries, including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, are all looking to make the world more dangerous and less safe.\nDiplomacy and appeasement have proven unreliable compared to military superiority when it comes to keeping the peace. More political pressure has to be applied to both parties to take a path to enhanced military readiness.\nRegarding youth education, there has been a steady increase in public funding for education over the years. At the same time, multiple test results for middle grade and high school students do not show an improving academic return on these outlays. This is troubling for many reasons including a more competitive global work environment, a growing need for domestic innovation and an historical correlation between income potential and educational achievement.\nAlso, and it should go without saying, sound government requires a thoughtful electorate. There are clearly many pressing concerns on the minds of Americans today, and they all deserve attention. The point here is that our preeminent standing in the world will be in jeopardy if we don't start paying more than lip service to a stronger national defense and improving educational outcomes.\nART CECIL\nEaston \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In addition to having fun and learning how to be savvy entrepreneurs, the girls participate in many community service projects and work to identify and solve needs in their hometowns.\nLast month, Girl Scout Juniors from Troop 896 and Troop 899, based out of Queen Anne's County, joined together to construct a Gaga Ball Pit at Martin Sutton Park in Ridgely.\nThis Bronze Award service project was the culmination of hundreds of hours of planning and advocating over the previous nine months. The Bronze Award is the highest honor a Girl Scout Junior (fourth and fifth graders) can earn, and it requires the girls to identify a community need and help produce a solution.\nThey decided on helping make Ridgely and neighboring communities a better place to play, and that lead to choosing to donate a Gaga Ball Pit to the park. They presented their plan and asked for permission to build the pit at a Ridgely Town Hall meeting last fall, and the Town Council accepted the proposal.\nOn June 2, the plan that they had all worked so hard to create was taken into action, and with the help of their dads, the girls constructed the pit. Through this process, they learned how to draw up plans, take measurements and utilize basic construction skills.\nGaga Ball is a fun, fast-paced and inclusive game for families and children to enjoy. Players use their hands to hit a ball at their opponents below the knees.\nIt combines the skills of dodging, running and jumping to avoid getting hit by the ball. It has quickly become a popular sport for children, with many nearby public schools having Gaga Ball Pits on their grounds.\nIt promotes physical activity and outdoor play and is easy to learn. The Girl Scouts also have Gaga Ball Pits nearby at Camp Todd and Camp Grove Point, and they have proven to be a great source of fun for those who visit.\nAll are encouraged to stop by the new site at Martin Sutton Park for a fun break this summer. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

On July 18, Brandy Dawson Cumberland and Christine LaMonica \u2014 who were appointed by the Dorchester County Council to fill Diaz and Morgan's seats \u2014 will be sworn in as the District 1 and District 3 board members, respectively.\nAt the meeting on Thursday, Hubbard said the board welcomes Cumberland and LaMonica and looks forward to working together \"to help make Dorchester County Public Schools a place where students are safe and get the best education possible, a place where teachers look forward to coming to work and want to serve their entire careers here, and a place where parents are happy to send their children to us, knowing we will do our all for them.\"\nALTERNATIVE EDUCATION\nAfter electing its new leadership, the board unanimously approved a one-year contract with Transforming Lives for an alternative education program for elementary and middle school students.\nThe program \u2014 which will be housed at The Judy Center at Sandy Hill Elementary School and at the New Directions Learning Academy \u2014 will cost the district $950,000, or about $79,000 each month for 12 months. The program will serve a maximum of 48 students at one time.\nAt the meeting, DCPS Superintendent Jymil Thompson said the district looks at this program as one stop in a student's education journey. He said it is a place where students can remedy behavior and improve academics before going back into a \"regular educational setting.\"\nThompson also said the district is looking for a new term to replace \"alternative education.\"\n\"We're going to change the term to something more positive in nature,\" he said.\nAlternative education has been a hot topic in Dorchester County this past school year.\nIn June, the Board of Education voted to terminate its more than three-year contract with Vision Quest, an alternative education program for district high schoolers that has been met with criticism from residents since the contract was approved in September. The district had been paying Vision Quest $93,363 per month for services, which would have added up to over $3.3 million over three years.\nOne day after the vote \u2014 and a tense discussion leading up to the vote \u2014 Morgan resigned from the board. Morgan was the only board member to vote against terminating the Vision Quest contract.\nAt the meeting on Thursday, Hubbard said the Vision Quest program will be available to district high school students for the first half of the 2024-2025 school year.\n\"And then we will make a determination somewhere in that timeframe (of) how to proceed,\" she said.\nOne thing Hubbard likes about the Transforming Lives program for elementary and middle schools is that the professionals from Transforming Lives will train teachers, she said.\n\"So that eventually we will be able to do this on our own without having to look to a third party,\" she said. \"So I think that's a very positive step forward.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

College representatives spoke to the council Tuesday, saying that the project will help the college support a slew of trade programs.\nDavid Harper, vice president for workforce and academic programs, said he hopes the project \"inspires not just students, but parents and local community members\" to understand the importance of living and working locally after receiving a trade education.\nThe project's estimated cost is about $56 million, with around $42 million of that expected from state funding and the rest expected from five counties served by Chesapeake College \u2014 Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne's and Kent. Talbot County's share of the remaining funding is 21.8%, second to only Queen Anne's County at 28.9%.\nThis cost, just over $3 million, will be split between fiscal years 2026, 2027 and 2028.\nKaren Smith, vice president of administrative services at Chesapeake College, noted the original project had Talbot's estimated share at more than $4 million. However, the project's scope was reduced as the college's marine technology program will not be included.\nThe facility will support agricultural, electrical, welding, HVAC, advanced manufacturing, carpentry and masonry programs.\nEarlier Tuesday, Chesapeake College presented to the Caroline County Commissioners. The commission, however, elected to take time to discuss the request with the county's finance team before pledging support.\nDorchester County, meanwhile, did not provide a letter of support. Lenny Pfeffer, president of the Dorchester County Council, pointed to the county's Dorchester Career and Technology Center.\nHe also said money is tight in the county because of The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, an ambitious public education program that many county school districts are grappling with affording.\nBut in Talbot County, council members expressed support for the project and voted unanimously to send the letter of intent.\n\"I'm so happy that this is coming,\" council President Chuck Callahan said. \"We definitely need it for all these counties. And it couldn't be better timing for all these trades, that's for sure. We definitely lack trades. \u2026 It's going to make a difference in 10 years. It's probably going to make a difference in five once it's up and going.\"\nTom McCall contributed reporting to this story. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Mentors calling for more volunteers\n\n July 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 570\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Talbot Mentors has seen a decrease of over 34% in mentor volunteers since the pandemic. So, staff is coming up with creative solutions to assist as many children as possible.This over 25-year-old organization has been providing students across Talbot County the opportunity to create connections, obtain academic support and develop skills for their future.\nKentavius Jones, executive director of Talbot Mentors, said prior to the pandemic mentor numbers were as high as 71 volunteers. But since the pandemic, volunteer numbers have consistently stayed between 50 to 60 mentors.\n\"One of the crucial parts of a relationship is actual interaction,\" Jones said. \"So COVID shut that down. \u2026 we just been trying to ramp up recruitment, but also being conscious about it. We want the right relationships, not just any relationship \u2026 It's meaningful connections and meaningful relationships. So recruitment looks a little bit different than it used to.\"\nJones said the organization has piloted a peer-to-peer program, pairing high schoolers with elementary school students.\nJones said there is an abundance of positive research about results seen through peer-to-peer programming. A similar program run by the Texas Education Foundation found that student mentoring resulted in a reduction in substance use, an increase in academic performance, a reduction of absences and truancy, a reduction of discipline referrals to the school office, and an increase in positive decision-making skills and risk resiliency.\nBut most importantly, Jones said, it has allowed for more mentor pairs to develop amid the dip in volunteer numbers.\nAn additional program that has assisted the organization is the Scholars program. This program exists through a collaborative effort with Building African American Minds and Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center and aims to help high school students achieve their academic goals through tutoring, assistance with college admissions, and help researching and applying for scholarships.\nJennifer Kott, a college success manager for the Scholars Program, said the program is aimed at first-generation students and students from marginalized communities, to whom they can provide greater access resources than may be available to them.\n\"My scope is to help these students with the arsenal of my colleagues and the people here in the Easton community,\" Kott said. \"To provide programming for the students anywhere from premier life skills \u2026 to creatively putting together a vision board right. Sort of providing hope for these students, and that hope is sort of groomed throughout the duration of their four years in high school.\"\nJones and Kott are proud of the programs and services Talbot Mentors provides to students, but despite the creative solutions, they said the organization is still seeking traditional mentors.\nJoan Evans, a mentor for Talbot Mentors, said she has been working with the organization for about six years and was paired with a then third grader from Easton. The experience allowed her to show her mentee and herself new skills and experiences such as a fishing competition, kayaking and boating, she said.\nHer mentee is currently an \"almost sophomore\" and has become a part of her family and heart. Evans said she encourages anyone who is interested in being a mentor to take the leap and volunteer.\n\"Being a mentor does not take any particular skill,\" Evans said. \"It's providing a child with your time and attention ... Talbot Mentors is a wonderful community resource for making the connection between those children who could use another positive role model in their life with those adults who can give their time, encouragement and support.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "\u2018Stretched very thin\u2019: Child care providers in Talbot County seeing long waitlists\n\n July 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1214\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CORDOVA \u2014 When Melissa Johnson flips through her binder, she's reminded of around 80 families anxiously awaiting day care services. Some of the children on the waitlist are under a year old. Others are not born.Johnson, the director of Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers' Cordova site, calls it a \"heart-wrenching situation.\"\nCritchlow Adkins is a nonprofit that provides preschool and before- and after-school care across five sites in Talbot County. Over 100 children are on the waitlist for Critchlow's child care services in Cordova.\n\"And I really feel so bad because I want to help them, but I just cannot,\" Johnson said. \"There's a staff-child ratio.\"\nRelief for some families on waitlists in Cordova is expected by next year.\nRenovation plans for Chapel District Elementary School will allow Critchlow Adkins to build a new preschool room for 3-year-olds, two additional classrooms, an office and a teacher workspace.\nNotably, Executive Director Christy Morrell said they will double the amount of before- and after-school children they can serve from 30 to 60. Currently, that program, which includes students in kindergarten through fifth grade, operates in the school cafeteria.\n\"When school's in session, we share the cafeteria,\" Johnson said. \"And there have been a lot of times that we have been displaced. We have to relocate because of an activity or something that goes on in the cafeteria.\"\nDividers in the cafeteria split the different ages. While staff and children have made the most out of the space, Johnson said, it has limited the number of activities and stimulated learning.\nThe dedicated classrooms will create a better learning environment for the children, Morrell said, one that is more akin to the Easton Elementary site that already has two full classrooms. Johnson and Morrell said it's important for children in before- and after-school care to have a consistent space they go to each day that creates a familiar environment.\nWhile the state is taking on efforts to provide accessible child care to families, facilities across Talbot County are limited in spacing and staffing. Many are forced to turn parents and guardians in need away or add them to extensive waitlists.\nBarbra Diaz, the director of the Talbot County Center for Children and Families, said the county's Early Head Start program has a waitlist. The federally funded program serves children under 3 and focuses on serving those below the federal poverty line.\nDiaz has administered the program since January, and the number one hurdle has been staffing, she said. Currently, the program is only taking in 20 of a possible 40 kids due to state-mandated staff-child ratios.\nIn Easton, The Lab Child Care Center provides care for over 100 children between its Cynwood Drive and Creamery Lane locations. Owner John Givens, who also runs The Lab Martial Arts and Fitness Center, said there's a rolling waitlist for children under two.\nGivens said The Lab faces the challenge of adjusting to rising costs required to provide child care and a new state scholarship program that hasn't yet worked out all its kinks. As a for-profit business, he said he has to balance doing as much as possible for families in need while also keeping the business afloat.\n\"It's kind of a double-edged sword,\" Givens said. \"From an owner/operator perspective, infants and toddlers in general are the most labor-intensive, they're the most expensive to care for.\"\n\"All parents who have kids who don't have a support network need day care,\" Givens continued. \"And I think the day care game in Talbot County is stretched very thin.\"\nCORDOVA EXPANSIONThe expansion of the Cordova facility, doubling capacity from 30 to 60 will help that situation, said Christy Morrell, the executive director.\nFor parents and guardians, Morrell says having a dependable place to drop off their children provides peace of mind.\n\"They're better employees, they're more consistent employees,\" Morrell said of parents who have a reliable day care service.\nDespite challenges in available space, Critchlow's Cordova site has remained at the peak of the state's quality rating system for child care and early education programs, Maryland EXCELS. It's accredited and has a Level 5 rating, the highest rank. Those efforts, though, have taken years of dedication and funding.\nCritchlow's upcoming Cordova expansion totals around $1.82 million, not including an outdoor playground and indoor furniture. Critchlow is working to fundraise that mark, helped in part by a $300,000 boost from the Talbot County Council in American Rescue Plan funding.\nJust last week, funding for child care was stressed at the state level when Gov. Wes Moore and the Maryland Board of Public Works approved $148.3 million in state budget cuts. The cuts are intended to make way for Medicaid and child care efforts by the state.\nHowever, Morrell is concerned that those cuts may actually hurt funding for child care in Maryland's rural counties. She pointed to a 25% reduction in funding for the Rural Maryland Council, which is run under the Department of Agriculture.\nThe grantmaking cut for the council reduces what was $9 million to $6.75 million available. Morrell had hoped to receive a council grant to contribute to expansion costs.\nSTATE PROGRAMThe state cuts are, in part, meant to increase the state's ability to accommodate a rising number of families in the Maryland State Department of Education's Child Care Scholarship Program. According to the Department of Education, about 42,000 children are enrolled. Eligible families receive aid in the form of vouchers that go to licensed providers, such as The Lab.\nThe program is meant to help families afford high-quality child care programs, which falls in line with the state's Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a state education initiative.\nGivens calls it a \"fantastic program in theory,\" one that allows parents with children to maintain jobs. However, he believes its issue \"is in the implementation.\"\nHe says the program's shortcomings cause late payments, and sometimes his business is providing six to eight weeks of service without payment.\n\"It's a scary world when you have back pay that's months or years old that you're trying to track down and chase down to get,\" Givens said. \"As an owner/operator, that is a scary thing.\"\nIn a statement to The Star Democrat, the state Department of Education said the program \"exhibits no systemic issues concerning timely payment processing for providers.\" The department pointed to its advanced payment practice that ensures timely payments, a practice mandated at the federal level.\nIf scholarship enrollments include additional children after advanced payment is calculated, accurate payments to providers are delayed. The state said it is in the process of reducing that delay period.\n\"MSDE recognizes the need to reduce the True-Up reconciliation period from 90 days to 30 days for providers receiving payments from the Child Care Scholarship program,\" a portion of the statement read. \"This reduced turnaround time requires technological changes in backend systems, and MSDE is currently working on those changes.\"\nWhile Givens said The Lab has always accommodated its families and children, he said the state's scholarship program is putting day care providers in a middle position.\nAnd in some cases, that may end up yielding a dilemma: provide a much-needed service to a family or ensure one's business remains profitable. It's a problem he said reigns true at a national level.\nGivens said child care should be considered a \"critical part of infrastructure,\" such as roads.\n\"We have to support it that way,\" Givens said. \"We have to figure out a way that all kids who should have care, can have care.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Like a three-legged stool, the community as a whole must come together with MSDE and Maryland READS for success to stand up, she said.\nMaryland READS recently wrapped up its summer series convenings to build networks and establish planning networks across the state, according to Maryland READS member Fred Curtis.\nThe READ Strong conveyings in Baltimore City and Queen Anne's and Montgomery counties saw stakeholders from a variety of different sectors, nonprofit executives, school board members and educators, he said.\nThese meetings provide ideas for a backbone of how to establish strong reading ecosystems rooted in the science of reading, he said. County convenings are instrumental in helping assist in sort of planning these efforts to bring people together and identifying what private ecosystems look like throughout different jurisdictions.\n\"For us, local experience, local expertise and relationships truly matter and they are imperative,\" Curtis said.\nMaryland READS will compile the data from the meetings for implementing feedback and continuous improvement, he said.\nOther events on the horizon for Maryland READS include additional READ Strong Network meetings in the fall, Happy Hour Conversations, and upcoming discussions to revolve around upcoming testing score releases.\nThe board expressed gratitude for the work of Maryland READS as a reminder of the individuals dedicated to the reading proficiency of all students and looked forward to progress.\nMaryland READS is actively recruiting for new board members for representation throughout the state and is accepting recommendations for its Expert Advisory Committee.\nMore information about Maryland READS, including its complete report on the state literacy crisis, can be found at https://marylandreads.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I am working on my certification to be a therapeutic riding instructor,\" Krantz said.\nHe worked with recreational riders and with special needs people under a senior mentor at Talisman. He teaches two to seven classes a day. Noel Douglas, who is the executive director at Talisman, told him about Maryland Corps. Three days later, he was enrolled.\n\"I really found my calling helping other people selflessly. It has been a transformative experience interacting with the Maryland Corps and the Service Year Option,\" Krantz said.\nHe said that it set him up for success and helped get him across the finish line even when the program got hard.\nKrantz has been offered a full-time position at Talisman.\n\"Just this last week, we had an incredible veterans retreat of active Special Forces operators. What an experience talking with these true American heroes and seeing the healing that was taking place immediately as soon as they met the horses. I feel so blessed and grateful that I get to do this every day. It is awesome to get to see all the smiles,\" Krantz said.\nKranz is a graduate of the Maryland Corps, a service opportunity launched by the state last year for people of all ages.\nMembers earn a minimum of $15 dollars an hour working in organizations that provide job training and professional development. Program partnerships with both Maryland's Historically Black Colleges and Universities and community colleges provide an additional level of collaboration and support for members, in addition to alignment with skilled trades and apprenticeship programs to facilitate transition into continued education or the workforce.\nThe program was rolled out alongside the Service Year Option, a similar program targeted at recent high school graduates.\nEmma Bush, a Service Year Option graduate from Salisbury, said her participation in the program helped her build skills that will help her in her future career.\n\"There was time management, resume building, how different personalities in the workplace can play into different scenarios. I loved the financial trainings,\" Bush said.\nShe ended up as a school liaison for the third through fifth grade classroom leader at the Epoch Dream Center is Salisbury. This is a free after-school and summer program that serves under-resourced children.\nShe had been volunteering with them when the director reached out to her and told her about the opportunity through the state. Her boss told her she would love to bring Bush on staff as a Service Year Option member.\n\"I have always had a passion for kids,\" Bush said. \"I love being able to work with them academically, but also work with them on character. Building the best person that they can be. I am doing year two with the Dream Center as a Maryland Corps leader.\"\nTo learn more about the Maryland Corps and Service Year option, visit www.serve.maryland.gov. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Considerations of the working policy include aspects such as curriculum adoption, assessment data, analysis, early warning systems, intervention and accountability.\nThe proposed policy aims to help the State Board of Education clarify and develop the more rigorous requirements already embedded in state statutes, according to Deann Collins, deputy state superintendent, and Tenette Smith, executive director of literacy programs and initiatives.\nThe proposed policy emphasizes the importance of economic issues and addressing literacy at a young age, Collins said.\nThe drafters welcomed feedback from a multitude of stakeholders, as well as reviewed other state policies, Smith said.\nAnother important aspect was ensuring the policy could articulate goals and align with the Blueprint for Maryland's Future's goals for improving literacy outcomes, she said.\nAchievement gaps in literacy persist across state demographics, according to Collins. Research suggests \"reading is an economic issue as well as an education issue,\" Smith said.\nMany Maryland students are not meeting reading grade level expectations \"and this gap has profound implications for the overall academic success and future and their future opportunities,\" she said.\nAccording to the 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 31% of Maryland students scored at proficiency levels or advanced, \"Which means a staggering 69 percent of our students did not reach proficiency,\" Smith said.\nThese findings underscore the urgent need for a unified comprehensive approach to ensure that all students develop strong reading skills early in their education to support their long-term academic success and high school graduation, she said.

Casey Foundation emphasized the critical importance of early reading proficiency.\n\"88% of students who failed to earn a diploma were struggling readers in third grade,\" Collins said.\nThe stakes are even higher for children living in poverty and are from a minority, according to Smith, who face a eight times more likelihood of not graduating on time if they lack reading proficiency by third grade.\nFour major components of the comprehensive literacy policy draft spotlight teacher support, assessment and parent notification, instruction and intervention, and retention and intervention.\n\"By improving literacy outcomes we can enhance the economic and social wellbeing of our communities,\" she said.\nAreas for additional consideration include addressing staffing models and class sizes, strategic training as well as how to hold students accountable, Collins said.\nThe draft policy is still in its early stages, and the department was grateful for stakeholders and partner collaboration to spotlight where work needs to be focused, she said.\nWith over 900 responses collected already, the office of the superintendent continues to receive input and feedback can be submitted at the MSDE website.\nNo final decision has been made regarding the policy and additional work is needed to finalize a timeline. Another revisited policy is expected to be presented for board action at a later date.\n\"This is just the beginning,\" Wright said.\nPublic comment about the literacy policy is expected, and the MSBOE will next meet Aug. 27.\nMore information about the MSDE can be found at marylandpublicschools.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Middle school and elementary school students will not be able to use their phones at any time during the school day, and the latter are advised to not even bring their devices to school.\n\"We're putting faith in our students and staff that they will work hard to follow this,\" Chief of Staff Dale Farrell said.\nTeachers will not be able to use their cellphones during instruction and administrators will only be permitted to use school-issued cellphones.\n\"We realize this is a heavy lift,\" Farrell said of staff members. \"Many hands make light work, so we're making sure that all staff know the expectation to uphold, model and enforce these expectations.\"\nFor the first offense in high school, the phone will be confiscated until the end of the day and the incident recorded.\nA second offense will warrant the confiscation of the phone until the end of the day when only a parent or guardian can pick it up, and the incident recorded as a Code 802, \"Inappropriate Use of Personal Electronics,\" in the student's discipline record.\nIn addition to cellphones, devices such as tablets, earbuds and wearable technology such as smartwatches and fitness trackers are also included in the policy.\n\"If your phone is taken, don't expect it back at lunch,\" Director of Student Services Cheryl Long said. \"It's gone for the entire day.\"\nThree or more offenses will include the above, as well as a Code 702 (insubordination) and a one-day in-school service.\nStudent refusal of any of the above offenses may also result in additional codes and/or discipline.\nFor a first offense, middle school students will have phones taken until the end of the day when they can pick them up, and a second offense the phone will only be released to a parent or guardian, similar to high school consequences.\n\"The research is staggering,\" Smith said. \"There is no such thing as multi-tasking. People think they are multi-tasking but they're not, they're just task switching. Your brain does one thing at a time.\"\nFor the first three days of school only, which begins Wednesday, Aug. 21, cellphones will be returned to middle school and high school students at the end of the school day.\nElementary school students will have their phones confiscated and only released to a parent or guardian.\nStaff members should not be using their phones during instructional time and offenses are as follows: A first offense will constitute an investigation and verbal warning, second offense carries an investigation and written warning, while a third time will be investigated with a written letter of reprimand.\nStudent school board member Hannah Heisler asked about an instance where if a student's laptop would not work, would they be able to use their phone to access school-related documents.\n\"Then what we would address would be getting them a laptop that would work instead of using the phone,\" Long said. \"We don't want to start taking the phones out.\"\nSmith added he wants to avoid cases where exceptions would be made.\nThe policy will be communicated through home phone calls to parents and emails, morning announcements, a video and by posters throughout schools.\nSchool jurisdictions around the country have recently moved to ban cellphone usage in schools, including Calvert County. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore to fill a vacancy on Talbot County's Board of Education.She was sworn in at the Talbot County Education Center during the Board of Education's meeting on Wednesday. Strawberry, who resides in Easton and has two children in the school district, said she's \"grateful\" and \"honored\" to serve on the board.\n\"It is fitting for me to be able to have direct knowledge and access to policies, procedures, strategic planning and programs that could be significant for the education of our students,\" Strawberry said.\nStrawberry was appointed to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Jymil Thompson from the District 1 seat. Thompson resigned from his position after being named the interim superintendent of Dorchester County Public Schools earlier this year. In June, he was selected by the Dorchester County Board of Education to remain in the superintendent role.\nStrawberry expressed three areas she hopes to focus on as she assumes a seat on the board.\n\"One is safety amongst the students in all of the schools,\" she said. \"Secondly would be sufficient and adequate staffing for our children to be able to succeed in their learning. And thirdly is preparing our community, our neighbors and families of our students to be equipped to support their children educationally as they attend school.\"\nStrawberry is a dedicated healthcare professional with over 15 years of experience in patient care, nursing leadership and nursing education, according to a press release from Talbot County Public Schools.\nShe holds a Bachelor of Science in nursing from Hampton University; a Master of Science in nursing, adult and community health from Wesley College; and a post-masters certificate in nurse leadership from Wilmington University.\nIn addition to her work in nursing leadership, Strawberry is an adjunct professor and mentor for nursing students at the University of Maryland Global Campus. She is an entrepreneur, managing independent businesses as a delegating nurse and as a real estate investor.\nShe is a member of the American and Maryland Nurses Associations and has served on committees, performed research and delivered presentations focused on a broad range of health care initiatives.\n\"I am committed to leveraging my expertise and professional experience to enhance the educational landscape of Talbot County and to ensuring a bright future for all students,\" Strawberry said in the press release. She will serve until a successor is elected during the next congressional election in 2026. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Delaware school boards increasingly see controversy\n\n August 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Julia Merola Spotlight Delaware | Section: News \n \n 2359\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n \"You're out of order\" was one of the most popular phrases of the night at Tuesday's Christina School District's Board of Education meeting. The sentiment was directed toward board members and attendees alike.Although the nearly four-and-a-half-hour meeting was certainly shorter than last month's nearly eight-hour-long meeting, tension between the board and community members was felt immediately.\nWithin the first 35 minutes of the meeting, Board President Donald Patton explained the rules of public comments and called attendees \"guests\" while doing so.\n\"Let me take a few minutes to remind our guests that you are our guests,\" he said. \"We have a session coming up called Opportunity for Public Comment if you've registered, and I will read the guidelines for correct participation. But as a guest, you cannot be disrespectful to the process.\"\nThe audience and community members didn't take being labeled as guests lightly.\n\"It was stated in the past that we are guests. We are not guests. This is a public body, this is a public meeting. You are elected officials. These are not guests. These are the bosses,\" said Rep. Madinah Wilson-Anton (D-Newark) as the audience applauded her. \"We have a First Amendment right to speak in public meetings, speak our minds. You can put policies in place that say you can't say certain things, but you can't police how we speak because you don't like it.\"\nWithin the last year, boards of education from Delmar to Brandywine have been subject to controversy, particularly around their most important duty: hiring, working with and overseeing a district's superintendent.\nNone have been more volatile than Christina, which voted last month to remove its superintendent after a meeting stretched more than seven hours into the middle of the night. Controversy in the Newark-area district has become so frequent that state legislators mandated that a Delaware Department of Justice attorney attend all meetings for the next year.\nSchools' governing authorityIssues occurring within boards are unusual, said Verjeana McCotter-Jacobs, the executive director and CEO of the National School Boards Association. It's more typical to see tension when a board deals with issues like budgets, boundary changes or closing schools.\n\"With 90,000 school board members on 15,000 school boards across the country, by far, most are doing good work, and they're focused overall, on the vision for the school district,\" McCotter-Jacobs said.\nA local school board essentially is the governing authority for a school district, said Paolo DeMaria, the president and CEO of the National Association of State Boards of Education. School boards can fulfill tasks like hiring a superintendent and approving budgets and curriculum priorities.\nBoard members aren't paid, but some receive reimbursements for incurred expenses.\nMcCotter-Jacobs also compared board members to members of Congress, as they typically don't have term limits. Board members are typically elected for four-year periods and can run for reelection as many times as they'd like, but some do have term limits.\nState school boards are similar to overseers for local school boards, in the sense that they have regulations that local school boards have to follow, McCotter-Jacobs said. The state school board isn't involved in how a local board carries out its regulations unless they receive a complaint or an appeal that they'll review.\nHow do Delaware's local school boards work?While independent, each Delaware school board has many of the same basic characteristics: members don't receive a stipend or salary, they have no term limits and the state school board sets regulations that might influence how the local school board decision-making.\nSchool board members must be Delaware residents and U.S. citizens, be 18 or older and must live in the nominating district, said David Tull, the executive director of the Delaware School Boards Association. An individual cannot be a paid employee of the district and must never have been convicted of embezzlement.\nAfter being elected to a school board, members have two state training sessions that they're required to complete within their first year. One session is for financial training and the other is due process training, which is for dealing with special education, Tull said.\nThe Delaware School Boards Association also offers its own boot camp for board members every July, covering a variety of topics like financial training, due process training, board member responsibilities and the need to follow Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) rules, among other topics.\nOther organizations like First State Educate, a nonprofit that aims to engage families and communities on education issues, share information about student outcomes and encourage school board candidates, also work to provide different resources and training sessions for board members.\n\"We're trying to train the public and the community and potential school board members, and then we're trying to train the board members themselves,\" said Julia Keleher, the executive director of First State Educate. \"Ultimately, if both people have the same knowledge and information, they're going to be able to operate much more effectively.\"\nThe organization recently announced its Center for School Board Excellence in Governance, to provide school board members with resources to \"lead with confidence and integrity.\" Their first set of courses will focus on parliamentary procedures, ethical decision-making and financial management.\nFirst State Educate is also pushing out information to help people understand what boards of education are supposed to do, and will recruit people for board elections starting in January, Keleher said.\nThe organization also has a school board consultant in New Castle County and is aiming to hire additional people to develop the same role downstate.\n\"We want to develop those roles and put that resource there so that those communities also have exactly what we built in New Castle County,\" Keleher said.\nDelawareCAN, an advocacy group that works on public education improvement and equity, partners with First State Educate to run trainings and to help get qualified people interested in running for school boards, said Executive Director Britney Mumford.\nChristina board tensions cause divideThe Christina School District's Board of Education has seen a tumultuous few weeks, with some public commenters labeling the board as \"an embarrassment.\" Tuesday's meeting did little to ease lingering tension.\nThe board's discussion information items in its Aug. 13 agenda included a \"referral to the Public Integrity Commission for an opinion on whether targeting of the superintendent by the board violates public trust and reflects unfavorably on the district,\" a second referral to the Public Integrity Commission for an opinion on whether engaged in self-dealing with the district \"through alternative entities,\" and a third referral on whether a board member's prolonged absence from the district undermines the public's trust.\nOther points included nullifying the July 2024 board officer votes and holding a new vote on board officers, reinstating Superintendent Dan Shelton \u2014 who was placed on administrative leave during the July 9 meeting \u2014 as \"the latest investigation uncovered no wrongdoing,\" and recommendations for an interim superintendent, among other items.\nHowever, a simple majority of board members voted to strike discussion on all items except naming an interim superintendent.\nIt later selected former Christina and Red Clay Consolidated School District Superintendent Robert Andrzejewski to head the district this coming school year \u2014 despite questions over whether he even knew he was being nominated.\nFive members of the state legislature who represent the Christina district \u2014 Reps. Madinah Wilson-Anton (D-Newark), Paul Baumbach (D-Newark), Cyndie Romer (D-Newark), Sophie Philips (D-Bear) and Eric Morrison (D-Glasgow) \u2014 also filed a FOIA violation against the board with the Department of Justice.\n\"As legislators, we generally try to stand back and let [the board] do their stuff, but when things have a problem, we start looking into it,\" Baumbach said. \"The closer you look into it, you realize how bad that the district board is being led.\"\nFOIA violations\nIn June, the DOJ found the board violated FOIA laws by holding an unannounced executive session for an improper purpose and failing to provide adequate notice in its March and May meeting agendas for votes regarding the contract rescission and vote of no-confidence in Shelton.\nIf a meeting is not noticed properly, meaning there will be items considered that were not on the agenda, then the public wouldn't know whether they need to attend the meeting or for how long they'd need to attend, said Mark Fenster, a law professor at the University of Florida who studies government transparency.\nFenster added that sometimes an agency might use vague wording in a public agenda because they may not know exactly what they're doing with the issue or what to anticipate, but know they will cover it.\n\"Members of the public are not being paid for going to these meetings, having other things to do and busy lives,\" Fenster said. \"If this is a trap or a trick that the agency is playing, this seems both kind of duplicitous and shady, as well as potentially illegal, because it's not really following along.\"\nThe DOJ is required to send a report to the General Assembly after its year-long observation. The report will include any FOIA matters observed and recommendations it has for necessary changes to ensure the \"proper operation\" of the board.\nPatton declined Spotlight Delaware's request for comment on the controversy, citing the \"potential for litigation.\"\nPatton made it a point to apologize to the public during the Aug. 13 meeting for \"a number of things,\" admitting the board should be functioning differently. Patton also said he's been working with a parliamentarian to help provide a stricter structure on Robert's Rules of Order to help streamline the meetings.\nPatton also acknowledged the FOIA violation complaints and said the board will be having a lawyer speak to them about the open records laws and violations.\n\"You have to remember when boards are put in place, folks aren't trained on these specific things,\" Patton said.\nAlthough Christina has been a longtime member of the Delaware School Boards Association, they decided to drop out this past year, said Tull, the DSBA executive director, who added that Christina's newest board member paid to attend DSBA's boot camp though.\nAlthough there's been a bit more public awareness in Christina, Mumford, of DelawareCAN, hasn't seen the average parent in the district become more interested in the board.\n\"There has been some of it, but it's really been to the extent of, 'Why are they acting crazy and not actually focusing on policies that affect my students?'\" she explained.\nMumford added that the public's perception of the board \"acting crazy\" might cause families to see board members as something separate from the community.\n\"When things like this happen, people get the perception that, 'Oh, these are just another group of power-hungry policymakers that don't care about my family and my students,'\" she said. \"Situations like this make it tougher to find good candidates moving forward because they don't see the school board as creating positive outcomes, as looking to really make a true impact. They just see it as this polarizing political entity.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The six-week work program gives students with learning disabilities and handicaps not only a path get out into the workforce, but many retain their jobs after completing the course.These teens do all kinds of things across five counties like washing dishes, taking movie tickets at a theater and working at a day care center. There are lots of different businesses who are willing to work with these students like Aaron's Place, Dorchester Parks and Recreation and the Kent County Animal Shelter.\nOne student learned data entry so thoroughly that he was teaching his employer a few tips.\nAs their names were to get their diploma, some were shy and some were triumphant with their arms in the air. Most were dressed up for the event. The crowd clapped enthusiastically for every kid. There were tears of joy as parents snapped cell phone pictures of their child in front of the balloon-covered backdrop.\n\"We are here to celebrate our summer youth connections program that we do for youth in the Upper Shore from Kent all the way down to Dorchester,\" said Dan Schneckenburger, executive director of Upper Shore Workforce Investment Board. \"Students with any kind of learning disabilities or handicaps, we place them with the employer. We off job coaching along the way.\"\nHe said this was the culmination of their achievement and their first job. He says they work with employers and with Division of Rehabilitation Services, which is part of The Maryland Department of Education.\n\"For a lot of these kids this six-week program is their first paid work experience. YMCA, animal shelters, restaurants. One kid liked IT. We placed him at the St. Michael's library,\" he said.\nCase manager Elizabeth Chiocca watched with pride as the kids got their diplomas.\n\"It is hard for local youth to find jobs and this gives them a stepping stone that they need,\" Chiocca said. \"Some of the businesses are actually hiring our students.\"\nYouth coordinator Deborah Boulden said she likes the intake part, where other people have written these students off.\n\"Because they do have a disability, some people write them off,\" Boulden said. \"We take them as they are and don't write them off. And we make diamonds.\"\nBoulden spoke to the crowd from a lectern. She was proud of many students who not only completed the six-week program, but stayed at their place of employment to keep working.\nMason Callis worked as a \"dishwasher at Mamma Mia's in Sudlersville, Maryland. Clean dishes, sweeping floor out in the lobby and in the kitchen. And washing and more dishes. I like my job very much, and I am a hard-working person.\"\nSavannah Quinn had a clerical job at Chesapeake College with tasks like shredding paper and making name tags for folders.\nOne successful multi-year participant in the program is Connor Swann. He is 21 now and was a keynote speaker at the event.\n\"Miss Debbie and Miss Elizabeth helped me get jobs. I started in ninth grade. One job was Chesapeake Cats and Dogs and the other was Talbot Humane Society. That helped me get great skills toward working with animals,\" Swann said. \"Right now I work at Dogwood Acres Pet Retreat in Kent Island. I am starting to train people now. I completed the veterinary assistant program at Chesapeake College. I am getting my associates degree in liberal arts. Then it is off to the real world of working.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "DCPS to offer new service for middle and high schoolers who can't attend in person\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 597\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Cambridge \u2014 Middle and high school students in Dorchester County Public Schools that require home and hospital services or are unable to come into school in person will be offered a new service this school year.At a Dorchester County Board of Education meeting Thursday, the board approved a contract with Edmentum, a learning technology company, for virtual synchronous instruction for students who aren't able to attend school in person for an extended period of time, whether that is for health reasons or other reasons.\nJodi Colman, assistant superintendent of academics and student services, said that middle and high schoolers in need of this service would receive instruction from real teachers throughout the week and would be able to sign up for support like office hours, if needed.\n\"They would get a much more substantial academic program while they're not able to be in school,\" Colman said.\nThis past school year, students who were unable to attend school in person were receiving services from tutors hired by the district. Colman said a lot of those tutors were Dorchester County teachers, and so they were only able to provide services after school at night.\nElementary school students requiring services outside of school will still receive tutoring as the Edmentum agreement is only for secondary students in the district.\nUnder the agreement, Dorchester County schools will be able to offer secondary students enrollment in the Edmentum courses on an as-need basis.\nColman said the service will cost $200 per student per course. She said she doesn't know exactly how much it will cost the district in total as that is dependent on how many students will need to enroll, but she estimates the total cost will be somewhere around $100,000.\n\"I don't know if we'll use that much or we'll need more,\" she said. \"Based on our students, last year, we would have needed more than $100,000, but we're going to see how that goes right now.\"\nThe district will get billed monthly for up to $100,000 for the service.\nAt the meeting, board Vice President Talibah Chikwendu asked about funding the service and how the district will pay for it if costs go over budget. Colman said some money can be moved from the budgeted line item for home hospital services tutor stipends and the district can also use Title IV or Title V funds.\nNEW SCHOOL YEARAt the end of the meeting on Thursday, board members wished everyone in the district a great start to the school year.\n\"Parents, you're about to turn over your kids to us, and we're going to give them our very best,\" board President Sheri Hubbard said.\nFor Dorchester County Public Schools first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and ninth graders, the first day of school will be Sept. 3. For seventh, eighth, 10th, 11th and 12th graders, the first day of school will be Sept. 4. For pre-K and kindergarteners, the first day of school will be Sept. 5.\nSuperintendent Jymil Thompson said he thinks the district is off to a great start to the school year. He said the professional development that teachers have been receiving has been \"excellent.\"\n\"I just think the whole team has energy,\" he said. \"Because I think that everyone is focusing on what we're in the business of doing. And that is instruction.\"\nSince becoming interim superintendent in March and then superintendent in June, Thompson has talked about the need to increase the district's ranking from 23rd to 15th in the state.\n\"I just want to make sure we keep the main thing the main thing,\" he said at the end of the meeting, \"and that's moving from 23rd to 15th.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County Free Library hosts youth STEAM Camp\n\n August 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MATT LAMOTTE Council of Friends of the Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 625\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It was a very special summer for the lucky children who participated in the second STEAM Camp for elementary and middle school students.The Easton branch of Talbot County Free Library hosted two week-long sessions of STEAM camp, which were designed and conducted by three area high school students and funded by a grant from the Council of Friends of the Library. The STEAM camp sessions were offered free of charge to the young students and included snacks and refreshments. They only needed to bring their imagination.\nSTEAM programs integrate science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics to foster a more holistic approach to education. The interdisciplinary approach encourages creativity and critical thinking, enabling students to engage in hands-on, real-world problem solving.\n\"In the library's STEAM camp, volunteer leaders Vivi Morris, Van Tran and Mia Mazzeo, who created the program, blended artistic expression with analytical skills to make learning fun,\" said Easton Library Youth Coordinator Laura Powell. \"The children who participated learned to collaborate across various disciplines, nurturing both their logical reasoning and creative potential.\"\nStarting with a traditional STEAM approach, Morris, Tran and Mazzeo adapted and designed the program to best suit the youngsters who attended each week of camp. The first session hosted 20 6-to-8-year-olds and the second had 20 9-to-12-year-old attendees. Both sessions were at capacity.\nOver the course of each week, the camper groups tackled a number of projects that required individual effort as well as cooperation within each camper team. Each day brought a new menu of activities \u2014 everything from tie-dyeing shirts and print-making tote bags to pass and paint or creating fruit art.\n\"The strategy of our STEAM program was to break the campers up into small groups so they could learn to both interact effectively with each other and apply the skills each camper had,\" said Alanna Peerman, library staff assistant. \"Each table of five campers had at least one volunteer High School student to guide and assist the campers.\"\n\"The campers particularly enjoyed making slime, as well as piecing together a Hex bug maze and racing the Hex bugs,\" said Mia Mazzeo. Two \"cooking through chemistry\" exercises were the highlights of each week. Van Tran added \"to watch each camper make ice cream by hand and cook s'mores using the sun was so much fun for all of us!\"\nVivi Morris agreed. \"The collaboration and teamwork was so 'chill,'\" she said. \"By the end of each week, we saw a community of learners, helping each other, enjoying each other's company, and being so excited as each group completed their activities and projects.\"\nThe enthusiasm was apparent by the students and parents alike. Two STEAM participants, Charlotte and Emmett McGrogan of St Michaels, loved every minute of their camp experience. Emmett, 9, attended the second session and especially enjoyed making slime. \"Doing crafting stuff was my most favorite activity,\" Emmett said. \"I can't wait to come back to STEAM Camp next summer.\"\nThe McGrogans' mom, Katie Willis, also gave the program rave reviews. \"As with many full-time working parents, my kids have been in a variety of summer programs \u2014 STEAM camp, which was free of charge, was hands down one of the very best,\" Willis said. \"The structure of STEAM camp each week was age appropriate, well organized and kept my kids engaged and busy the whole time. They want to go again next year, most definitely.\"\nThe Council of Friends, now celebrating its 50th anniversary, had the three camp leaders present their ideas last spring to the Council, which did not hesitate to offer the funds needed to provide the best experience for the campers. Based on the success, FOL President Emilie Knud-Hansen said \"there is no question we will fund next year's camp.\"\nInformation on the Library's upcoming STEM Festival can be found at tcfl.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In front of the building, participants inscribed chalk messages on the sidewalk.\n\"People love the school systems here. The future lives in that building,\" Mitchell said, pointing to nearby Centreville Elementary.\n\"It's deeply frustrating that QACPS wants to cut some of our lowest-paid educators who work directly with our students, and at the start of the year, no less. We don't know how many people, or what job titles,\" Mitchell said in a statement ahead of Tuesday's rally. \"There are any number of ways to deal with budget problems, but not if you won't talk to your educators.\"\nAccording to a press release issued by the Association, they were notified on Aug. 14 of the potential layoffs of \"an unknown number of QACPS support staff, who are among the lowest-paid employees in QACPS.\"\nThe Association seeks the superintendent and school board to address the budget shortfall before pushing it on to employees, Mitchell said.\nThe layoffs announcement came after the school district asked Queen Anne's County educators on Aug. 12 to accept five unpaid furlough days during the 2024-25 school year.\nThe educators association said they asked for documentation to justify the furloughs and were \"sent no response nor documentation, and then refused to meet on any of the dates offered to discuss the matter.\"\nSeeking budget transparency, the Association has filed a formal information request, with questions including where the money was going, and what is being done that doesn't involve cutting positions, according to Mitchell.\n\"So, we just have two questions for Dr. Saelens. First, why are you asking us to cut our salaries if you won't ask the county for additional funding, and second, why won't QACPS answer our questions about the budget crisis like the law requires?\" Mitchell said.\nOther measures needed to be exhausted first before the proposed Reduction In Force and layoffs of essential support staff, she said.\nMitchell highlighted the effect layoffs would have on the livelihood of support staff, who ensure the optimal running of the school, while making up the smallest portion of school system employees, \"And they make the least amount of money,\" she said.\nAccording to a statement from Superintendent Patricia Saelens, the school system sought to balance the budget through attrition.\nSaelens noted the \"severely underfunded Blueprint For Maryland's Schools, coupled with overall inflation has created a recipe of frustration\" \u2014 a deficit that Queen Anne's County is not alone in facing, she said.\nAs a result of that lack of attrition there is still a current shortfall of two million dollars. Saelens wrote in a letter to staff on Aug. 19, \"This summer, we have worked to do a detailed budget analysis and determine what could be cut to put those funds into salaries. We have identified numerous items to help reduce the budget shortfall. We will cut scanning, tutoring and locally funded conferences. We will reduce our legal line item. We will cut school block grants by 10%.\"\nAdditionally Saelens wrote the district is canceling the Cenergistic Energy contract, and repurposing the staff tuition reimbursement line. \"While these measures will help, it is simply not enough to balance the budget,\" she stated, \"Under Maryland Law, a local board of education is prohibited from carrying a budget deficit.\"\nSaelens contends the district met with the union on July 18 and 31 to discuss a retirement incentive and potential furlough days. The retirement incentive was not successful as only two employees took advantage, still leaving them under the attrition necessary to balance the budget.\nTogether with the union, Saelens said they selected dates that purposely would not impact student days. \"We also determined the proposed furlough days would be for all employee units, including the superintendent and all administrative staff. These proposed five days would have avoided the need to reduce any member of our staff,\" she said, \"We know that each of our employees are vital to the successes of students. It was our intention to keep our staff whole.\"\nSaelens said they provided the union with all the information they requested within 24 hours, meeting again on Aug. 6 and sharing a draft MOU regarding proposed furlough days.\nGiven the upcoming start of the school year, we requested that they provide us with their decision by Aug. 12, Saelens said. The union responded in writing informing leadership that they \"formally decline Queen Anne's County Public Schools proposal of furlough days for the 2024-2025 school year\".\nAs a result, Reduction In Force (RIF) letters were issued on Aug. 14, in accordance with the RIF process outlined in the negotiated agreement, Saelens concluded.\nWhether proposed furlough dates or RIF, the teacher's union has a ratified contract based on an offer the BOE presented to the union that was accepted, according to Mitchell.\n\"We must take care of each other,\" she said.\nShowing support for fellow union members and district bus drivers, Tony Mansfield stated the rally was a \"good start\" and sought collaborative efforts to come up with a budget that does not include reductions and a solution that honors the contract ratified in June.\nSchool psychologist Julie Rock, of Matapeake Middle School and Kent Island Elementary School, stated it was her job to advocate for students and the rally highlighted the invaluableness of the various support needed within the walls of the schools. \"Right now, the students that need us the most are going to be losing the support,\" Rock said.\nStanding alongside QACEA was Lori Hrinko, President of Cecil County Classroom Teachers Association. \"This isn't about you wanting more, this is about what's right for our kids,\" Hrinko told the crowd.\nHrinko encouraged everyone to be involved in their school districts, as students represented the future generations.\nQACEA is a local affiliate of the Maryland State Education Association (MSEA), which in turn is an affiliate of the National Education Association, and Mitchell voiced appreciation of the organizations' support.\nWorking to promote change through action, Mitchell hoped to inspire students of all ages and showcase that change is possible.\nMitchell noted issues cannot be addressed by avoiding dialog or shifting blame, \"Problems can only be solved with conversation, creative solutions and direct contact,\" she said.\nMoving forward, Mitchell seeks to have all groups unite with the same underlying goal: identify the best interests for the good of students. \"[Working] together; real numbers, real decisions,\" Mitchell said.\nMore information about QACEA can be found at https://qacea.org.\nThe Board of Education will next meet for a regular meeting Sept. 4 at 6 p.m. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One side includes a screenshot from the U.S. News & World Report's web page on the district's finances. \"And what are taxpayers getting for all this money?\" the flyer reads.\nOn the other side, it reads: \"Despite all of this spending, math proficiency for students in Talbot County stands at a dismal 17.2%, well below the state average. It doesn't add up! With all this taxpayer money being spent, what are they teaching our kids?\"\nTalbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi briefly addressed the mailers during an Aug. 14 Board of Education meeting.\n\"There (were) inaccurate monetary figures on that card, number one,\" Pepukayi said. \"Yes, I will say we have work to do in the area of math, and that's one of our priorities.\"\nThe superintendent said there will be a Board of Education work session in September to show recent state testing data that is currently embargoed. The state average math proficiency rate for the 2022-23 school year was about 25%, according to the Maryland Department of Education.\nReturn addresses indicate the mailers were sent by Pay Attention America Inc., with an address listed as 1000 N. West St. in Wilmington, Delaware.\nThe group's registered agent is listed online through the Delaware Department of State as The Corporation Trust Company, also located in Wilmington. The company offers registered agent services and has provided these services to more than 300,000 businesses, according to its website.\nRepresentatives from The Corporation Trust told The Star Democrat that Pay Attention America is newly formed, and thus, no contact information can be publicly provided since the group hasn't filed an annual tax report.\nThough not confirmed to be behind the mailers, a website with a domain of payattentionamerica.com describes itself as a \"group of concerned citizens across the United States of America joined to combat the decline of our beloved country.\" No contact information or addresses are listed on the website.\nAs of Tuesday evening, The Star Democrat has not received a response from a contact form submitted on the website payattentionamerica.com.\nResident Hilary Spence received the flyer in her mailbox on Aug. 9. She was most struck by \"the anonymity\" of the mailers for such a small community. \"It's hard to have dialogue with nobody to (have) dialogue with,\" she said.\n\"That's what offends me the most, to be honest, as a local resident supportive of public schools,\" Spence said. \" \u2026 It's like if you have something to say to me \u2026 say it to my face.\"\nEaston resident Shari Wilcoxon had a different stance on the mailers.\n\"I was actually pretty excited to see that someone was willing to tell the truth to the public,\" Wilcoxon said. \"Because I feel like most people have absolutely no idea of the state of the education system in Maryland.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This event not only contributes to the care of students of all ages, but it creates community for residents throughout Easton.\nBeth Anne Dorman, president and chief executive officer at For All Seasons, said the resource fair has become one of the largest community events in Easton, bringing together over 25 different organizations and over 1,700 people.\n\"We are really taking care of all of the kids in the ways that set them up for success,\" Dorman said. \"For school, mental health isn't just about our mental health and talk therapy, but it's also about making sure that children have what they need to be able to show up at the school year authentically and with some safety.\"\nIn addition to the school supplies provided by For All Seasons, dozens of organizations set up tables and provided rulers, pens, dental care kits, notebooks and over a hundred children's books.\nMarilou Russ, assistant director for Appleseed Books, said the organization provides free children's books to families across the Eastern Shore by collecting donated books.\n\"We come to programs and events throughout the counties on the mid shore, which would include Caroline, Talbot and now even Dorchester County, and then we give the children out the free books so that they have books,\" Russ said. \"Our belief is that they have their own collection of books that they can call their own.\"\nIncluded in the event, families had the opportunity to enjoy games, free Rita's Italian Ice, and arts and craft activities.\nMayra Casillas, an event attendee, said she just moved to the area and learned of the fair on Facebook. For Casillas, it seemed a great opportunity to engage with her new community and for her children to have fun.\n\"It's also great to have backpacks and a bunch of other school supplies,\" Casillas said. \"It helps families that don't have the income to buy for their kids.\"\nDorman said the event has grown significantly since its origin six years ago. It has reached the point where For All Seasons will be expanding the venue for next year since it has become too crowded for Idlewild Park. Dorman said she is proud of this event and the amount of people it assists.\n\"There are times where we have an opportunity to dig in a little bit deeper as a community,\" Dorman said. \"This is an example of when we think outside of the box, and we really think about the whole person when we're thinking about mental health. It gives us an opportunity to make a difference in a way that maybe is not going to happen in the four walls of an office, but this is real community outreach and community connection and partnership.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bands from the district's schools joined together to welcome staff, and many other students performed and introduced speakers for the gathering.\nJeremy Hillyard, the district's 2024-2025 Teacher of the Year, and Rosario Steele, the district's 2024-2025 Support Staff of the Year, were each presented with a 2025 Chevrolet Trax from Hertrich Chevy Buick GMC of Easton.\nGeneral Manager Pat Papineau thanked Hillyard, Steele and all of the district's teachers for their dedication to their professions.\n\"I imagine that a lot of people think that your guys' job starts a few minutes before the kids get there and ends a few minutes after the kids leave,\" Papineau said. \"That couldn't be farther from the truth. \u2026 It's pretty much nonstop. You're continuously trying to improve yourself, you're continuously investing in yourself, you're continuously investing in your students.\"\nHillyard, a Spanish and English second language math teacher at Easton High, and Steele, an instructional assistant for English second language students, both delivered speeches to the crowd.\n\"Each of us in this room plays an important role in our students' stories,\" Hillyard said. \"And it's our job and up to us to make that role a supporting one by always having their backs.\"\n\"This job has been the most rewarding experience in my life,\" Steele said. \"I have witnessed those students that start as ninth graders with very little English inspire me when I see them in the community after graduation.\"\nMany other awards were handed out during the event. AJ Rojas, the district's facilitator of interpretation and translation, was presented with the Wardell Brine Multicultural Award. Robin Werner, director of teaching and learning, was named winner of the Brewster Merrill Technology Award.\nNamed after a past superintendent, the J. Sam Meek Unsung Hero Award was presented to three staff members: Charlotte Compton and Heather Ewing, teachers at Easton Elementary, and George Larrimore, a bus driver since 2010.\nMOVING FORWARDDistrict Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi closed Thursday morning's festivities with a speech indicating major areas for the district to focus on. Some examples were staffing, transportation, dress code and student behavior.\n\"I believe in bite-sized chunks and taking it slow, so that it's not a lot and it doesn't seem overwhelming,\" Pepukayi said.\nShe noted that adding mentors for incoming teachers and math coaches has been successful for the district. Pepukayi said the district will begin working on a new four-year strategic plan, as the current plan wraps up in 2025.\nAt the end of her speech, Pepukayi indicated the district is maintaining its three priorities of improvement heading into the 2024-2025 school year: academic equity in math, an \"engaging\" environment for students and staff, and recruiting and retaining a more diverse staff.\n\"We're going to stay the course with these three priorities as we continue to move into this next year of transforming and performing together,\" Pepukayi said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright 2024",

    "title": "Courage Needed by Blueprint Accountability Board",
    "date": "2024-08-24",
    "author": "Kalman Hettleman",
    "content": "The Blueprint Accountability and Implementation Board has done a remarkably praiseworthy job of fulfilling its mandate to hold state and local educators accountable for carrying out the sweeping demands of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future.Do you know who the AIB is not holding accountable? The governor and General Assembly, although it has the power and duty to do so.\nAnnapolis is ignoring growing evidence that the Blueprint is in deep trouble as a result of inadequate funding. It's not the only implementation problem but it is the one that most endangers the long-run success of the Blueprint.\nFunding shortfalls have been obvious for at least three years. They include a lack of funding for classroom essentials, interventions for struggling learners, career and technology education, and special populations and a crushing burden on local governments. When local education agencies were asked their greatest challenges in implementing the Blueprint, funding was high on their lists.\nYet the governor and legislators have not confronted the scope and magnitude of the dangers ahead.\nIs there anything the board can do to prod action even though its members are appointed by the governor? The answer is yes. The AIB has a lever to force Annapolis to pay attention \u2014 if it has the political courage to use it.\nUnder the Blueprint, the Accountability and Implementation Board is charged not just with planning for implementation and exercising oversight. Little-known but crystal-clear provisions in the Blueprint require it to recommend \"legislative changes, including any changes necessary to ensure that the implementations have adequate resources.\" A further section requires it to determine whether \"funds provided by the state and local governments are consistent with the Board's estimate of what is necessary to fully implement\" the Blueprint.\nTo track compliance with these and other provisions, the Accountability and Implementation Board must file reports by Nov. 1 each year. Its 2022 and 2023 reports are silent on whether Blueprint funding is adequate. The board says it's laying the groundwork to do so: It has established benchmarks to measure progress and will use this data over the next few years to assess funding sufficiency.\nBut that's too late. The evidence of inadequacy is plain and painful to see.\nThe denial of reality was displayed at a recent joint meeting of the Accountability and Implementation Board and the state Board of Education. They were wrestling with setting targets for Blueprint progress, like the numbers of students achieving proficiency in reading and math. The targets were \"aggressive\" and \"ambitious,\" all agreed.\nBut questions about whether there were enough resources for the targets to be met were brushed aside without specific answers.\nIt was evident in two recent meetings of the state board. In one, it was reviewing Blueprint provisions calling for students to meet high career and college standards by the end of the 10th grade. The discussion focused on interventions in the 11th and 12th grades for students who don't meet the standards. Fortunately, state Superintendent Carey Wright interjected that \"a pre-K to 12 strategy is required \u2026 we can't wait until high school.\" In fact, the Blueprint compels intensive interventions in all grades.\nAt the most recent meeting, the superintendent's proposal to retain third graders who don't achieve grade level in reading \u2014 a feature of her remarkable success as state superintendent in Mississippi \u2014 ran into trouble. Several board members and local educators argued that there was too little funding for interventions in grades K-3 to avoid retention for large numbers of students.\nThey're right. The Blueprint only includes a small amount of money for interventions, mainly for struggling readers, in grades K-3, and that expires in fiscal 2026-2027. And there is no funding at all for interventions for students below grade level in grades 4-12.\nWhy this disconnect between the Blueprint's ambitions and the resources to enable it to succeed?\nOf course, the big political reason is the unwillingness in Annapolis to face up to the need to raise taxes to pay for adequacy. This applies even to paying for the current (inadequate) price tag, which rises to $4 billion annually in 2033.\nNo doubt, raising revenue is harder these days given the state's projected budget deficits in the years ahead. Still, there's no alternative if the state is to fulfill its constitutional mandate to provide an adequate education for all our schoolchildren.\nAnd despite Annapolis's reluctance, Maryland has the wealth to raise a lot more revenues if it has the political will.\nThe steep political climb must begin by telling the truth about the lack of resources. State and local educators shy away from truth-telling because they fear incurring the displeasure of the governor and General Assembly. So it's up to Accountability and Implementation Board to do its statutory duty. It must, without delay, at least sound the alarm over the most obvious and critical fiscal hole in the Blueprint: timely interventions for struggling learners.\nAt the same time, educators must convince Annapolis and the public that Blueprint money will be well spent. Better management is as important to the Blueprint's success as more money. Still, mistrust can be overcome if state and local educators show that current funding is being spent efficiently.\nOn that score, the Maryland State Department of Education is demonstrating a promising new capacity to ensure effective implementation. The Accountability and Implementation Board, to its great credit, has fully enabled and supported the state education department's renaissance. But now it's fiscal crunch time, the ball is in the Accountability and Implementation Board's court, and it must talk the Blueprint truth to Annapolis power.\nKalman Hettleman was a member of the Maryland Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education, also known as the Kirwan Commission, a former Baltimore City school board member, a former deputy mayor of Baltimore and a former Maryland secretary of Human Resources.",

The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company is leading construction, which started Aug. 5.\nA short ceremony outside the school provided attendees insight into the renovations and what benefits will follow. Speakers included Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi, Principal Kari Clow, Talbot County Council President Chuck Callahan, Board of Education President Emily Jackson, Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers Executive Director Cristy Morrell and two students, Abdiel Santamaria and Laney Childress.\n\"This groundbreaking ceremony symbolizes not just the start of construction, but the beginning of a vision coming to life,\" Clow said. \"A vision of a school that will provide an environment where our students can thrive, learn and grow into the leaders of tomorrow.\"\nConstruction on the multimillion-dollar project is expected to take a couple years. The school was built in 1952 and last renovated in 1994.\nDuring Friday's groundbreaking ceremony, Pepukayi thanked the school's teachers and staff and emphasized safety is a top priority as the school year begins and construction continues.\n\"Together the Chapel District Elementary School staff has shown patience and flexibility to work with Whiting-Turner and associates, keeping safety a priority while the project moves forward,\" Pepukayi said.\nThe Talbot County Council allocated a projected $26.9 million in capital project funding to Talbot County Public Schools for the renovations. That funding is expected to span across both fiscal years 2025 and 2026.\nThis April, the state's Interagency Commission on School Construction unanimously approved a $3.8 million funding request for the project. Lisa Vaughn, capital project manager for the commission, said on Friday that the \"kids are worth every penny.\"\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, the project includes a full renovation of the existing building and around 16,000 square feet of additions. There will be additional learning space for the school, as well as the Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers site located in the building.\nThe school's media center is moving to the center of the building, and the playground is also under renovation.\nOn behalf of the board, Jackson thanked the county and state for funding the renovation.\n\"Funding these improvements for our cherished elementary school shows the collective commitment, not only to education, not only to rural education, but to rural education for our earliest learners,\" Jackson said. \"It does not go unappreciated or unnoticed.\"\nFollowing the ceremony, administrators, teachers, staff and students took turns shoveling the dirt to commemorate the beginning of construction. \n\n (c) Copyright 2024",

Results showed a 0.5% statewide increase in English proficiency and a 0.8% statewide increase in math proficiency. 48.4% of students tested proficient in English, and 24.1% of students tested proficient in math.\nTalbot, Caroline and Dorchester counties all fall below these state averages, though those three districts did increase in English and math proficiency from the 2022-2023 school year.\nTALBOTThe 2023-2024 results show Talbot County Public Schools saw an increase in English and math proficiency, while following state trends with dips in science scores.\nEnglish proficiency increased 2.8% to be 47.3% proficient, which ranks 14th in the state out of 24 districts. Math proficiency increased 1.1% to be 18.3% proficient, which ranks 18th in the state.\nScience levels for TCPS dropped along with the state, as Talbot County fell from 29.5% to 16.9% proficiency in fifth grade science. The county dropped from 30% to 20.1% in eighth grade science. District-wide rankings fell four spots for each category, as Talbot is now 19th in fifth grade science and 16th in eighth grade science.\n\"The 23-24 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment results showed modest improvement across all MD Districts,\" Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said in a statement emailed to the Star Democrat. \"In Talbot County, our overall margin of progress as a district was slightly larger than what the State achieved as a whole. These results will inform our continued work on the initiatives that we put in place to provide our educators with the resources needed to ensure student success. We also know that student success is measured by many indicators in addition to state assessment scores.\"\nCAROLINETendencies for Caroline County Public Schools in math and reading proficiency align with state trends. However, like Talbot, Caroline County dropped in rankings for science proficiency.\nEnglish proficiency rose 2.1% to 45.3%. Math proficiency rose 3.9% to 19.7%. Both rankings slot Caroline County at 15th statewide.\nCaroline County's proficiency marks went from 34.4% to 17% in fifth grade science and 22.1% to 19.3% in eighth grade science. The district's rankings fell from 13th to 18th in fifth grade science and 15th to 17th in eighth grade science.\nDORCHESTERWhile Dorchester County Public Schools still ranks in the bottom four for English and math proficiency rates, the district did see year-to-year increases in those two categories.\nIn English, the district rose 1.4% to 33.7% proficiency, which ranks 22nd in the state. In math, the district rose 1% to 12.3% proficiency, which ranks 21st in the state.\nDorchester County's science proficiency marks went from 23.5% to 14.4% at the fifth grade level, and from 19.1% to 15.3% at the eighth grade level. Its fifth grade science ranking, though, did increase from 22nd to 20th. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With all the \"back-to-school\" sales, getting these things for the best price can be really time-consuming.\nOnce you have all those physical things ready, how do you prepare yourself and your child?\nIn her article \"How To Spiritually Prepare for Back To School,\" Shelby Turner suggests that we need to do more. She says that we need to commit to diligently praying for our children. We need to pray for their safety, friendships, academic success and character growth. We have to remember that school makes a massive impression on our children.\nHere are a few prompts and scriptures to help you:\nFor faith, pray Ephesians 3:14-19 and ask God to firmly establish your children in the love of Christ.\nFor friends, pray over them Romans 12:2 asking God to bring godly friends into their lives.\nFor academics, pray Proverbs 2:6 asking God to give them the passion they need to gain wisdom.\nFor character, pray Deuteronomy 31:6 praying that the Lord will give them the courage to try new things, make new friends and be a witness for you.\nAnd finally, for safety and success, pray Psalms 91:1 and Colossians 3:23 asking God to keep them safe and to work in all things not for man's glory for the glory of the Lord.\nSo, get the physical taken care of and continue to work on the spiritual daily for the entire 180 days of this school year. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Plans to address test scores, cell phones shared by district staff at Moms for Liberty meeting\n\n August 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 On Monday evening, Talbot County's chapter of Moms for Liberty, a nationwide conservative political organization, held a meeting with Sharon Pepukayi, superintendent of Talbot County Public Schools, and other district professionals.During this meeting, attendees shared their concerns about the state of education in Talbot County, including low math scores, and student cell phone use.\nJan Greenhawk, chapter chair for Moms for Liberty, expressed gratitude for the attendance of the district representatives, including Debbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools; Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent for school leadership and Student Success; and Vulieka Jarmon-Horsey, assistant superintendent of administrative services, systems and strategies.\n\"Y'all don't realize what a privilege it is to have a superintendent and a school board and her staff that will come in and talk to your group and answer questions,\" Greenhawk said. \"Believe me when I say that because I have friends who are chapter chairs on the western shore. That does not happen.\"\nGreenhawk noted there may be times \"we disagree, and that's okay, but we can talk through issues.\"\nDuring the meeting, Pepukayi shared news of a research-based math and English language arts curriculums that will be implemented in schools.\nIn addition to the new curriculum, the county has added some positions to help, such as math coaches. According to Pepukayi, while these changes are important, it is essential to roll it out slowly so as to not overwhelm teachers.\nPepukayi's emphasis on changes to the math curriculum comes after an anonymous countywide postcard was mailed to county residents criticizing Talbot County Public Schools.\nThe 14-by-8.5-inch, two-sided post cards were sent out to the residents of Talbot County last week. The flyers included a screenshot from the U.S. News & World Report's web page on the district's finances, and on the other side they shared that Talbot County students' math proficiency stands 17.2% below the state average.\nShari Wilcoxon, an attendee of the meeting, expressed concern over the postcards that were sent to residents. She told representatives in the meeting that there will be \"multiple other ones coming out.\"\nThe following morning, a second round of similar postcards arrived in residents' mailboxes. Instead of addressing math scores, this postcard addressed English proficiency, stating that 59% of students in third through eighth grade are not proficient in English.\nCELL PHONE USE\nDuring the question-and-answer portion of the meeting, several attendees asked for the district's overall stance on student cell phone usage during school hours. Pepukayi shared the district's policy on cell phone usage may be different from what is practiced in the classroom.\nPepukayi said the district is piloting a new program called YONDER as a way to limit cell phone usage in the classroom.\n\"It's a cell phone pouch, and what it is is a student comes into school, they put their cell phone in this pouch, and it locks,\" Pepukayi said.\nAccording to Pepukayi, the pouches will stay with the students and will be locked all day until they leave and press the pouch up against a magnet, which will allow them access to their cell phones.\nPepukayi said the roll out of the pouches have not begun yet. The district would need to communicate the plan with families and have a board presentation on it. The draft plan is to start rollout after Thanksgiving.\nRobert Jurrius, a math teacher at Easton Middle School, said it is difficult for students to stay off their cell phones, but it is made worse by parents who text their kids during school hours.\n\"I'm going to say with all authority that I can muster, (parents) need to break that addiction that you have to be able to reach a child every time anything occurs,\" Jurrius said.\nToward the end of the meeting, Pepukayi said it was important for her to take the time to talk to community groups and hear their concerns. It falls under the district's theme of \"transforming and performing together.\"\n\"I'm a big proponent of people knowing the facts, and number two, making sure we're partnering with anyone who wants to help our Talbot County Public students be successful,\" Pepukayi said. \"And so whatever that looks like, we'll partner and we'll talk about the issues.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Leonard Hall Junior Naval Academy prepares for move after a century\n\n August 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 655\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Following a difficult several months, Leonard Hall Junior Naval Academy is finally righting the ship and looking to leave its long-time port.The academy, which currently has just 15 students in grades 6 through 12, did not have its lease renewed by the St. Mary's County commissioners earlier this year and is looking for a new home.\n\"We are working closely with the commissioners to find the right place for us,\" said Leonard Hall Junior Naval Academy Board of Trustees President Amie Milan, who said the academy was currently on a month-to-month lease and is looking at a few locations in the county, though she wouldn't say which ones. \"If we need more time, we'll work with the county and we'll build on that time and then move when it is appropriate.\"\nMilan said a move from where the academy has been for the past 115 years would require \"a lot of logistics. You just have to be prepared.\"\nShe added that a move could be made as early as this fall.\n\"I'd love to stay here because of our history, but no matter where we are, we're still Leonard Hall,\" Anita Drury, a Leonard Hall graduate and historian of the school, said.\nIn January, the county commissioners voted to terminate the academy's lease as of June 30 this year.\nThe situation became even more awkward when a letter about the premature closing of the school was sent out at the time.\n\"I've heard the incredible impact the school has had in helping students turn their lives around,\" Commissioner Eric Colvin (R) said in January.\nThe commissioners eventually agreed to the month-to-month lease after the school temporarily closed following the January decision.\nOn Monday, Milan said, \"We recognize [the commissioners] have no ill will toward the school.\"\nThe academy had 40 students in January, but ended the school year with less than 10.\n\"It's been challenging,\" Drury said. \"We've gone through all the emotions you'd expect us to go through.\"\nDuring Leonard Hall's open house on Monday afternoon, Jemi Camlin of Charles County said her son Israel \"was just very dismissive, had a bad attitude and he used to talk back.\"\n\"He went from failing summer school to a 4.0 [GPA] in 18 months,\" at the Leonard Hall, Camlin said, adding he is now in his third year and a squad leader. \"I love just the discipline, I love the organization, that they can be more accountable, the family aspect and the small and individualized classrooms.\"\nMilan's son, eighth-grader Rex Bothwell, said he earned all Ds and Fs in public school, but after transferring to Leonard Hall had all As and one B so far.\n\"I like the etiquette and how they teach,\" he said. \"I like the establishment about the military and how they do things around here. I like how they establish classes and they give us a timely manner to us to get things done. It's really made an impact on my grades.\"\nLeonard Hall, which is a nonprofit that depends on funding from tuition and donations, currently has 15 students and six teachers.\n\"Right now we need to clear the air because there's a lot of misinformation out there,\" Milan said. \"A lot of people still think we're closed. [We want to] communicate the positive aspects and try and put that [last] year behind us ... We want to focus on the kids that are here today and make sure they have the best opportunity to learn in the military and academic environment we've established, regardless of the facility we're in.\"\nMilan added she would like to get enrollment up to 100, which she said \"is doable.\"\n\"If we could have a solid, stable year for these kids, I think that's probably the bigger impact,\" Milan said. \"We've all gone through the stages of frustration, of anger, of is this going to work, is it not going to work? Then we get calls from parents saying, 'We need you. My kids need Leonard Hall,' and that's what keeps us going.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Her path has been anything but straightforward, marked by significant personal challenges, including the loss of her father at a young age and her own battle with a rare genetic mutation, which led to life-altering surgeries. Despite these hurdles, Jablecki's love for adventure and art has driven her to excel in her career and inspire her students.\nIn this episode, Jablecki discusses the transformative power of art education, especially within a TAB (Teaching for Artistic Behavior) classroom. She shares how her student-centered approach empowers young artists to explore their creativity and develop confidence. Jablecki recalls a particularly touching success story about a seventh grade student who, initially struggling with a self-portrait assignment, ultimately produced work that exceeded all expectations\u2014demonstrating the profound impact of perseverance and support in the classroom.\nJablecki also speaks about her involvement with the Art of Education University, where she recently completed her Master's degree and is involved in an exciting project documenting \"A Year in the Life of an Art Teacher\" as a YouTube Vlog series. This achievement, alongside her dedication to continuous professional development, underscores her commitment to providing the best educational experience for her students. Her enthusiasm for visual journaling and choice-based art education has made her classroom a haven for creativity, where every student is encouraged to trust the process and embrace artistic challenges.\nAn adventurer at heart, Jablecki also shares stories of her travels, including a recent trip through France and Spain. This experience, she says, was not just about seeing new places but about connecting her students with the wider world through the lens of art.\n\"ArtScene | The Podcast\" is dedicated to exploring the personal lives of our teachers, providing a glimpse into their world and the stories of who inspires our communities.\nListen to these inspiring stories on \"ArtScene | the Podcast\" by tuning in to \"ArtScene | the Podcast\" on Spotify or at: https://anchor.fm/artscene.

She also recently was able to take a ride in a C-130 military transport.\n\"I know I really want to be an F-35 pilot,\" she said.\nThe Civil Air Patrol held an open house Aug. 28 at the St. Mary's County Regional Airport, welcoming young potential members from the community.\n\"We're here to tell members of the general public about our program,\" Wing Cadet Program Director David Trick said of the CAP cadet program, which is open to members in Grade 6 through 21 years of age. \"Of course a lot of folks that are here this evening are here to hear about our cadet program [which offers] career exploration in the United States military as well as careers in aviation. It's a fantastic program that gives folks the opportunity to learn to fly, explore careers in aviation, perform search and rescue, perform community service and do a variety of other things that are beneficial to themselves and their community.\"\nCadets usually stay in the program, which is an auxiliary of the Air Force, from ages 12 to 17, though they are able to remain until they are 21. The program's core values are integrity, excellence, volunteer service and respect.\nThere are squadrons in Calvert, St. Mary's and Charles counties.\nThe program is exactly why Charles and Emma David stopped by with their 11-year-old daughter Amelia.\nCharles, who retired three months ago following a 20-year career in the U.S. Marine Corps and Army National Guard, said he and his wife found out about the CAP during a middle school orientation.\n\"We both kind of thought, 'This would be a great thing where we can do father-daughter things together,'\" he said. \"I think it's a great opportunity for students of all ages to be able to participate in their county, their community and have a hand in civil service.\"\nEmma David said she likes \"that they're giving children of this age structure, values and they're striving for excellence. Just to have that in a world of chaos to have something very structured like this and can instill good values in children for the future. I don't think you can go wrong with that.\"\nAmelia, who attends Margaret Brent Middle School, said she liked what she saw.\n\"I think it's amazing for kids to have an opportunity like this at such a young age to be able to have different opportunities like flying planes, getting to do emergency rescue service and getting able to survive in the wilderness for a week,\" she said. \"Getting to do all these fun things at 11 just sounds fun.\"\nInside, a large throng of parents and their children browsed through literature and listened to testimonies by current members.\nTaylor's brother Eric joined CAP before her and at first Taylor thought the idea of joining was a \"hard no.\"\n\"I didn't think I'd be interested in it or that it wouldn't be for me,\" the cadet master sergeant said. \"And then I learned I could fly and get my pilot's license and I thought, 'Oh, that's really cool.'\"\nEvelyn Roulhand's father was an F-18 pilot at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, and a friend suggested she check out the program.\n\"I know a lot of people where [the military aspect] was not their forte, but they came and really enjoyed it,\" said the 16-year-old St. Inigoes resident. \"There are so many branches in this program that it's almost a certainty you will find something.\"\nAnd does Roulhand even envision herself leaving the Civil Air Patrol after almost four years?\n\"No sir, I don't,\" she said.\nFor more information on the Civil Air Patrol, go to www.gocivilairpatrol.com. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I know times have changed, but some policies have remained intact from my school days. I was an elementary student in the 1950s \u2014 no talking anywhere in that building. But during recess, we screamed and hollered until downtown Bishopville heard us.\nSchool lunch is important for students to have a successful day at school. Not all kids eat or even want breakfast \u2014 whether at home or the ones served at school each day, so a nutritious lunch is very important. Some students like to have packed lunches from home.\nNow what was packed in my lunch box? In the winter, Mom would sometimes put homemade soup, and in the spring she put Kool-Aid drink. The sandwiches were usually the favorite in the 1950s, bologna with mustard and sometimes cheese, but mostly bologna. Sometimes we took a homemade biscuit with a piece of fried ham leftover from supper the night before.\nLet's explore some lunches today's students like \u2014 either from home or the lunch line.\nBBQ CHICKEN CUPS1 roll of Pillsbury Grands biscuits (usually the Southern style works best but you can use any flavor your child likes), 3 lbs chicken breast, 1 cup chicken broth, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, barbecue sauce.\nPlace chicken breasts in the bottom of the crockpot. Pour chicken broth and seasonings over chicken. Cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3-4 hours. Remove chicken from the crockpot and shred with two forks. Mix with your favorite barbecue or hot sauce. Bake the biscuits according to directions, then immediately when they are done tear a biscuit in half and flatten it, place it into a muffin tin, top with chicken and shredded cheese, and bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes.\nPB&J APPLES2 apples, 1/4 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup jelly.\nSlice apples into \u00bc-inch rounds. Use a small cookie cutter to cut the core from the center of each slice. Spread peanut butter on jelly on half of the slices then cover with the remaining halves. This is one that you'll want to make in the morning so the apples don't brown overnight.\nPB&J SUSHI4 slices white bread, 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter, 1/2 cup grape jelly.\nRemove crusts from bread. Using a rolling pin, roll bread until very flat. Spread with peanut butter and jelly and roll tightly. Cut into 2-inch pieces and serve.\nPICKLE ROLL UPS4 slices of your child's favorite lunch meat, mustard or mayo, cheese, pickle wedge.\nSpread mustard or mayo on the slices of meat, layer some cheese then another layer of meat. Roll a pickle wedge up and pack tight. You can use any variety of meat, cheese or condiments in this dish.\nTURKEY CLUB ROLL UPS4 slices deli turkey, 2 tsp mayo, 2 slices cheddar (halved or quartered), 1/2 cup shredded or chopped lettuce, 1/2 tomato (sliced), 1/4 red onion (thinly sliced), 1/2 avocado (sliced), 4 slices cooked bacon, kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper.\nOn a clean work surface, place two slices of deli turkey and spread a thin layer of mayo on top. Top with 1 slice cheddar, half of the lettuce, tomato, red onion and avocado, and 2 slices bacon. Season generously with salt and pepper. Roll up and secure with a toothpick, then repeat with remaining ingredients.\nGRILLED CHEESE ROLL UPS8 thick slices of soft white bread, 1.5 cups finely grated cheddar, 2 tbsp melted butter.\nOne by one, slice the crusts off of each slice of bread, then use a rolling pin to flatten. Add a pinch of cheese to each slice, making sure you leave a small strip at the end to brush with butter. Tightly but carefully roll up each slice to the end, brush with butter, then roll shut and place seam-side-down. Brush all over with butter. Add roll ups to a dry pan seam-side-down over low-medium heat and fry until golden all over with the cheese starting to leak out. Use your tongs to frequently turn them. You may need to do this in two batches depending on the size of your pan.\nNUTELLA BANANA SUSHIThis recipe is by the single serving, so repeat as many times as you need.\nNutella, 1 banana, 1 whole wheat wrap.\nLay your wrap on a breadboard and slather with Nutella, Place the banana on top of your chocolate coating, Roll the wrap as you would sushi or a burrito and carefully slice into rolls.\nHAM, MAC N CHEESE MUFFINS2 cups of your favorite macaroni and cheese, 2 large eggs (beaten), 1 cup diced ham, 1/4 cup breadcrumbs + 2 tbsps. Combine macaroni and cheese with eggs, ham and 1/4 cup breadcrumbs.\nStir until well combined. Spray eight openings in a muffin tin with non-stick spray. Use an ice cream scoop to add 1/2 cup of mixture to each cup. Gently press mixture down with your fingers to flatten it into each cup. Sprinkle with additional bread crumbs. Bake in a 350-degree oven for 20-25 minutes depending on how soft or firm you prefer your muffins. Immediately remove from cups to cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate after 30 minutes of cooling.\nRICE KRISPIE PEANUT BUTTER BANANAS2 bananas, peanut butter, 1 cup of crispy rice cereal, foil or parchment paper so you don't have to wipe peanut butter smears off your counter.\nFirst peel the bananas and cut them into thirds. Then dump some cereal onto your wax paper, smear the bananas in peanut butter and roll the peanut butter bananas in the cereal.\nPEPPERONI PIZZA STICKS1 Pillsbury pizza crust, 40 pepperoni slices, 10 mozzarella cheese sticks, 2 tbsp butter, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp dried parsley, your favorite marinara sauce for dipping.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees. Spread pizza dough out on a lightly greased baking sheet. Cut the dough into 10 equal size rectangles. Arrange 4 pepperoni slices on each rectangle and top with a mozzarella cheese stick. Roll up the pizza dough, enclosing the cheese stick, pinching the seams closed. Melt the butter and add the garlic powder and dried parsley. Brush the pizza sticks with the butter. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This equates to a total county allocation of $75.1 million plus an additional $42.1 million in state funding, for a total operating budget of $118,400,000 for FY 25, according to Moran.\n\"However, the board is currently operating with a projected budgetary deficit just six weeks into FY 25 and there are concerns that this trend will continue to get worse in the coming years,\" he said.\nThe commissioners reiterated the audit was \"not a witch hunt\" but a means in which to support the Board of Education including assistance in identifying resources, guidelines, and best practices with the County's Finance Department and the Spending Affordability Committee.\nCommissioner Chris Corchiarino noted when things go wrong some people have a tendency to get caught up in the blame game and not put forth viable solutions.\n\"We want to fix things,\" he said.\nCommissioner Jack Wilson noted the audit would be a good first step and \"huge push toward transparency across the board\" and with the current fiscal state of Maryland, time was of the essence.\nCommissioner Phil Dumenil noted Superintendent Patrica Saelens, the Board of Education, and leadership have been \"more than cooperative\" regarding the endeavor and a review of the financial books.\nWith the Board of Education's next fiscal year budget process beginning soon, work is underway narrowing down potential firms to expedite the auditing process as quickly as possible, and no final schedule has been set, County Administrator Todd Mohn said.\nThe audit is capped not to exceed $100,000. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County pilots cell phone pouches in schools, other districts to follow\n\n September 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 610\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 Some students in Caroline County are without access to their phones to begin the school year due to new cell phone restrictions.Caroline County Public Schools began a policy where students at Colonel Richardson Middle School and Lockerman Middle School put their phones in locked pouches during the day to prevent usage during class.\nThe students carry the pouches, designed by the company Yondr, during the entire school day, with their phones inside but not accessible. At the conclusion of school, a magnetic, unlocking device lets the students unlock the pouches and retrieve their phones.\nCaroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said middle school was the right level to implement the test of the technology.\n\"Middle school students are wrestling with a lot of things, a lot of changes,\" Simmons said. \"There's a lot going on for kids at that time, a lot of research is talking about the impact of devices on kids at that age in particular.\"\nAs Caroline County pilots the Yondr pouches, Talbot and Dorchester counties are preparing for implementation later this fall. Across the board, there is a common goal of improving in areas such as student achievement, attendance and discipline.\nSimmons said his district attempted to take a strict stance on cell phone usage after the pandemic. However, teachers and administrators found it hard to enforce the policies in large classrooms and settings.\n\"The devil was in the details of implementation,\" Simmons said. \"Saying it and getting folks to be able to monitor was really hard. \u2026 Being able to keep an eye on every kid who's (looking at a phone) \u2026 it's impossible.\"\nThe pouches cost about $30 each. Simmons said Yondr believes the pouches will last three to four years.\nDorchester County Public Schools will be implementing a similar pilot later this school year. Valerie Goff, DCPS communication and community outreach specialist, said the district is hoping to begin its pilot before the end of October for middle school students only.\nTalbot County Public Schools may follow suit soon thereafter. At an Aug. 26 Moms for Liberty meeting with school administration, TCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the district hopes to roll out the same Yondr pouches after Thanksgiving.\nPepukayi and Easton Middle School math teacher Robert Jurrius responded to questions about access to cell phones in the event of a school emergency.\n\"I need you to pay attention when something bad is happening,\" Jurrius said on Aug 26. \"And there is no circumstance where a child looking at their phone at that moment is going to be safer. Parents might feel better that they can reach their child, but they're actually endangering their child.\"\n\"What I've heard from the emergency response and the crisis management people,\" Pepukayi said, \"is they want students to be able to listen to the directions of where they need to go and what they need to do versus being distracted in looking at their phone.\"\nSimmons said the same regarding the situation of a school emergency while kids' phones are locked in pouches. \"If there's an absolute emergency, we need the kids to focus in on their teacher,\" he said.\nIn Caroline County Public Schools, Simmons said the district will track if there's a decrease in student discipline or increases in student focus and achievement. If results are positive, the policy could extend to other schools in the district.\nWhile the superintendent did say the high school level \"presents an interesting dilemma\" and a need for balance as students are being prepared for adulthood, it's the next step if Caroline County's pilot yields improvements.\n\"If we do see positive impacts in the middle, it absolutely warrants that we look at it at our high schools in some settings,\" Simmons said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some organizations in attendance were Minary's Dream Alliance, the Easterseals and Open Doors Partners in Education.\nArnold's two hour musical set was interrupted briefly by Foster and President of Washington College Mike Sosulski.\nFoster informed people who weren't familiar with the town, of Hebe, the wine-bearer to the gods. She was recently honored on Aug. 15, the 125th anniversary of her installation, Foster said.\nFrom mythology to history, he pointed out in 1790, Chestertown was the first town to take a census, noting the area was considered to be the center of the country at one time.\nSosulski congratulated all his students. Because of the freshman, he proclaimed, this year had the largest incoming class, at 293. The school is not only breaking enrollment records. He said the electric boat team already broke the Guinness World Record for the distance a battery-operated boat travels. The former record holders were from England in 2001. Sosulski said the college beat them by six hours.\n\"And the semester just started. Who knows what's next?\", he relayed to the audience.\nHe welcomed his students of course, but also the public in general to all the things the college has to offer.\nThe college is making significant strides to ensure every student or visitor to the college is comfortable no matter what views he or she may hold, he said in an interview following his public remarks, and are in the preliminary stages of stating that formally, with input from students, staff and faculty.\n\"It's important we stand up for Washington's principles of free expression,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton High teacher named finalist for Maryland Teacher of the Year\n\n September 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 671\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Every day in the classroom, Jeremy Hillyard keeps a simple, two-word phrase in mind: \"Yes, and.\"He learned the phrase from his involvement in Improv Easton, a local comedy group. It's meant to encourage improvisers to listen to their partners and appreciate their ideas.\n\"I hear what you're saying, I'm going to honor it, and I'm going to grow from it,\" Hillyard says.\nAs a Spanish and English as a second language math teacher at Easton High School, Hillyard embraces the \"Yes, and\" philosophy with his students. It's a core message he has delivered to teachers across Talbot County and the state since he was named Talbot County Public Schools' 2024-25 Teacher of the Year in April.\n\"That philosophy has really carried over with me into the classroom,\" Hillyard said. \"Having my students know that I have a genuine interest in them as human beings and that I will do what I need to do to support them.\"\nOn Wednesday, Hillyard was named one of seven finalists for Maryland Teacher of the Year by the state's Board of Education. A selection panel nailed down finalists from 24 district teachers of the year through a rigorous application and evaluation process.\nHillyard was shocked when he heard the news of his selection as a finalist from colleagues who texted him congratulations.\n\"I'm like, 'What are they talking about?'\" he recalled. \"I checked my email and it said I was a state finalist, and I was like, 'Holy cow, I'm a state finalist?'\"\nHillyard and the other finalists will attend a reception in Baltimore on Oct. 4 where the Maryland Teacher of the Year will be announced.\n\"It's very, very humbling, and I'm very grateful to know that my efforts to go above and beyond are being recognized,\" Hillyard said.\nSTEPPING UPHillyard has taught at Easton High School since 2010. His original background is in the foreign language department. Last year, the school was in need of a teacher for its English for speakers of other languages, or ESOL, math course.\nHaving a certification to teach math, he stepped in and took on the workload without any hesitation.\n\"To me, the best teacher is when they see an educational need that they can help with, they do it,\" Hillyard said. \"They jump in there and do it.\"\nBy using his skill sets in math and Spanish, he's been able to embrace the challenge of teaching children at a wide variety of progress levels in their English abilities. Depending on their backgrounds, some may come in on track in math, but unable to complete operations in English.\nHillyard lays the groundwork by starting with basic math in English and then moving to more advanced arithmetic as the full-year course continues.\n\"They each come with a set of their own challenges and strengths and weaknesses,\" Hillyard said. \"That kind of challenge pushes me to want to figure out a way to overcome those or address those.\"\nLOOKING AHEADHillyard and the other 23 district teachers recognized this cycle will have opportunities to explore the state and collaborate throughout the upcoming months. Hillyard's excited for that journey, which includes stops at Deep Creek Lake in Garrett County and the statehouse in Annapolis.\nWith the school year beginning, he said he's also excited to advance initiatives with colleagues at Easton High.\nRecently, the morning announcements have been presented in both English and Spanish, with the help of Hillyard's Advanced Placement Spanish class. He's hoping small improvements will make the growing number of Spanish-speaking students feel more welcomed at Easton High.\n\"I'm very excited in my school to be working with some colleagues at making our entire school a more equitable environment for our Spanish-speaking community or multilingual community,\" Hillyard said.\nNo matter the background of a student, the district teacher of the year aims to play a supporting role in the student's academic journey.\n\"The students, at the end of the day, they're the authors,\" Hillyard says.\n\"That positive relationship and them knowing that my classroom is a safe, supportive place and they can learn and be themselves without being judged or criticized, is truly the secret ingredient.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Beginning with mentoring a group of middle and high school students, the number of interested boys continued to grow. With a need evident, they asked each other \"where do we go from here?\" and \"All4Love\" was formed.\nWith a mission statement \"we are dedicated to improving the lives of adolescents and young adults in the Cambridge community by providing transformative and holistically developed opportunities, uniquely fit for our community.\", they worked with the schools and other advisors to create programs to help. They felt, \"with the tumultuous times Cambridge has faced politically, economically and socially there is a need to change the narrative and bring hope back.\"\nThorpe said every day is a new day filled with opportunities to make the next day better. The organization has created a number of programs to help achieve its goals, including a high school mentoring program including guidance, an elementary to middle school flag football league, an elementary breakfast club and an after-school music program they continue to increase the number of youth they are serving.\nThorpe was born and raised in Dorchester County, graduating form North Dorchester High School. After graduating, he attended Chesapeake College and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.\nThorpe oversees the development and operations of the organization. He said, \"believing in the power of consistent and collaborative efforts creates lasting change.\"\nFor more information about the Rotary Club of Cambridge visit Cambridgemdrotary.org.

    "content": "For Dorchester superintendent, it's all about teaching and learning\n\n September 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 746\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 When Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson stepped into a third grade classroom at Sandy Hill Elementary during one of the first weeks of the school year, he saw sheer energy.\"They might have been doing a social emotional learning lesson,\" Thompson recalled. \"And the kids were so involved. They were standing up in their chairs. And the teacher was so energetic.\"\nEveryone was engaged. And for the student that didn't want to get involved, the teacher had him help her with the lesson on the computer so that he was still participating.\nNeither the third grade teacher nor the school's principal knew Thompson would be stopping by Sandy Hill Elementary that day.\n\"And so you know it wasn't a dog and pony show,\" he said.\nFor Thompson, who visits the school system's buildings and classrooms every week, the reason for these visits isn't to catch principals and teachers doing the wrong thing. It's to create a comfortable atmosphere of teaching and learning and to offer guidance when needed.\n\"I used to be a principal, I used to be assistant principal and teacher,\" Thompson said. \"So I want to make sure that they are comfortable with me and know I'm here to help better them and get them supports to be better.\"\nSince becoming superintendent in June, Thompson has made known his hope of bringing the district's ranking up from 23rd to 15th in the state. In an effort to do this in four years, the district has identified different steps to making that happen.\nThis year, the district is focusing on instructional leadership, taking a top-down approach in an effort to improve student success. Thompson considers instructional leadership \u2014 or leadership that focuses on teaching and learning \u2014 as his top priority this school year.\n\"Outside of the teacher, administration has the most impact on student achievement, without a doubt,\" he said, adding that because principals oversee the entire school, and not just one classroom, they have the most impact on student achievement.\nJodi Colman, assistant superintendent of academics and student services, said that Dorchester County is usually toward the bottom when it comes to rankings among the other school districts in the state.\n\"And at this point in time, the only way we're going to change that rating and our students are going to start performing at higher academic levels is (if we) focus on instructional leadership within the school system,\" she said.\nIn March, the Dorchester County Board of Education approved a purchasing agreement to bring coaching and professional development support for district administrators.\nThompson, the then-interim superintendent, said at the March 25 board meeting that the district executive team expects all its principals to become \"great instructional leaders,\" but not enough professional development has been provided to those leaders.\nOn Sept. 16, Thompson said this professional development support includes leadership meetings twice per month that focus on how administrators should give feedback to teachers on how to improve in the classroom.\n\"Making sure that (administrators are) continually developing (teachers') skills to deliver the best instruction to the kids,\" he said.\nIn order to jump from 23rd in the state to 15th in four years, Thompson said the district will need to be consistent with developing instructional leadership and follow through on it.\n\"Making sure that I'm having meetings with the principals, having conversations on how they're progressing on their goals,\" he said. \"And if they're not progressing, how can we shift and go in a little different direction to ensure that they're meeting their goals?\"\nThompson thinks one of the biggest challenges the district faces this year will be getting people comfortable with change and holding them accountable to those changes. He said that often, people automatically think accountability is negative, but when you don't hold people accountable, you end up doing them a disservice.\n\"We don't want to fire anybody,\" he said. \"We want people to do what they were hired to do. And we want to be able to provide the supports when people are struggling at their craft, and then help them improve their craft. When we talk about accountability, that's what we mean.\"\nColman said that change can be uncomfortable. She said she hopes that by the end of the year, people in the district will find a comfort in being uncomfortable.\n\"We're only going to make this move if we all know that we've got the same target and (know) that we're all going to have to push ourselves to probably go and do things that we're not normally used to doing,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot school board sees test scores, improvement initiatives\n\n September 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 836\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 State test scores released last month show a slight increase in math and English proficiency levels at both the district and state levels.Talbot County's Board of Education discussed that trend and others during a work session on Monday, taking a first deep dive into the test results from 2023-2024's Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program.\nIn English, 47.3% of Talbot County Public Schools students tested proficient, a jump of 2.8% from 44.5% in 2022-2023. In math, 18.3% of students were proficient, up 1.1% from 17.2% the year prior. The district slots in 14th and 18th, respectively, in those categories among the state's 24 districts.\nENGLISH TRENDS\"One of the things that the board is always interested in is how does Talbot County Public Schools compare to other districts in the state,\" said Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership, while presenting the English results. \"And I wish that I could give you better news and say that we have flip-flopped the map, but if you compare this year's results to last year across the state, you will see very little change. There is not a single district in the state who is leapfrogging in improvements on this map.\"\nEinhorn and Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi emphasized that the district internally tracks student learning levels. This is done at benchmarks throughout the year.\n\"I can assure this board that more than 47% of our students are mastering grade level standards,\" Einhorn said of the English proficiency rate. \"It's just that they are not showing it across the state on this particular assessment.\"\nSome positives for the English rates included third grade proficiency and the growth for certain cohorts and subgroups. Third grade English proficiency saw a significant jump from the 2022-2023 school year.\nEinhorn pointed out that in 2023, sixth grade students were 40.1% proficient. That same group of students came in at 43.8% proficient on the seventh grade test. \"For that cohort of students, it's growth,\" Einhorn said.\nEinhorn said all student groups saw growth in English rates, though Black students had the smallest increase.\n\"We are reaching every student in some sense, in some capacity,\" Board President Emily Jackson said of the subgroups. \"Maybe not as well as we could, but we're getting there, we are making growth, and that's what I want to see.\"\nMATH TRENDSIn math, the district has many initiatives to increase proficiency. Einhorn said the number of elementary math coaches has increased from three to six, along with an addition of one middle school math coach.\nThe district is implementing an adaptive testing program called Measures of Academic Progress for kindergarten through eighth grade to track student growth.\nIn 2023-2024's state test scores, TCPS students showed increases across the board.\n\"We see slight increases for each one of our student groups,\" Einhorn said. \"We have less of an increase for our Hispanic and Latino students. And we still continue to have fewer than 5% of our Black students and our multilingual learners proficient in mathematics.\"\nFor proficiency levels below 5%, the state does not indicate exact percentages. Of the 24 districts, the Talbot district is one of three below the 5% mark in math proficiency among Black students, and one of nine districts below the 5% mark in math proficiency among multilingual students.\nEinhorn and Jackson each thanked the Talbot County Council for its commitment in funding education, particularly the math coaches in elementary schools.\n\"When you see movement like we did in third grade,\" Jackson said, \"I think that we are making really intentional, really important, really good funding decisions that have a big impact on learning.\"\nEXPERT REVIEWSAs required by the state's education initiative, Blueprint for Maryland's Future, experts vetted by the Maryland Department of Education will be reviewing school districts across the state. Einhorn said state reviewers will be visiting three elementary schools in Talbot County this year.\nThose schools will be Chapel District Elementary, St. Michaels Elementary and White Marsh Elementary. They were chosen for separate reasons. Einhorn stated: Chapel for reviewers to look at literacy instruction, St. Michaels to review practices for multilingual learners and White Marsh due to success in state testing.\n\"They had significant growth in their math achievement across all grades in this last MCAP assessment,\" Einhorn said of White Marsh Elementary. \"So they want to know what White Marsh is doing well.\"\nJackson asked how the district can take lessons learned from these three schools to its largest elementary school, Easton Elementary.\n\"Can you speak to how we plan to address that?\" Jackson asked. \"How do you take what you've learned at a very small, very specific population and duplicate it or replicate it at a school like Easton Elementary?\"\n\"One of the things that we do even though it's a larger school, we have committed the same types of resources but just on a larger scale,\" Einhorn said. \"So while our smaller elementaries might have one math coach, we see multiple math coaches to be able to service the number of classrooms that we have at Easton Elementary.\"\nEinhorn said other schools in the district will have state reviews in the next year or two. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The two actors captivated the audience with a conversation between these historic figures and the attendees, offering a unique perspective on liberty, freedom and the Constitution.\nSmith highlighted the importance of reading and learning history as a \"manual for mankind to be better.\" With humor and deep knowledge of Jefferson's life, he stressed that \"when you allow destruction of your neighbor's rights you allow destruction of your own.\"\nWallace detailed the flaws within the early years of America, pointing to how slavery oppressed millions of human lives for generations despite the country's claim to be a land of freedom. He emphasized the importance of remembering the injustices of the past to improve the future.\nThe free event drew a large crowd, eager to celebrate and reflect on the significance of the U.S. Constitution. State Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) delivered a welcome address, setting the stage for the day's festivities, which also included the Sons of the American Revolution in period costumes, a color guard and a town crier who announced the signing of the Constitution. Students from Saints Peter and Paul High School and North Dorchester High School were in attendance.\nThe event also honored new U.S. citizens in Talbot County, recognizing their achievement in earning citizenship credentials. Attendees enjoyed free Constitution giveaways and sweet treats afterward.\nAlthough the event was well-attended, organizer Julie Quick said that the Constitution Allegiance aims to reach even more schools and individuals in the future. She said, \"the Constitution is so important for everybody,\" adding that it goes beyond being a political document. She said it serves as \"the foundation of who we are,\" encouraging individuals to \"think beyond ourselves.\"\nIn addition to the public celebration, the Constitution Alliance is committed to engaging local youth. On the following day, students from St. Michaels Middle High School participated in a special event where they watched a reenactment and interacted directly with the actors, fostering a deeper understanding of the nation's founding principles.\nThe event was hosted by the Constitution Alliance; The Institute for Religion, Politics and Culture at Washington College; and Operation Frederick Douglass on the Hill and was supported through local sponsors.\nBeyond this event, the Constitution Alliance remains focused on increasing Constitutional literacy among students of all ages. Through educational programming and its annual $1,000 higher education scholarships, the alliance seeks to inspire a new generation of citizens committed to upholding constitutional values. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In math, the district rose 1% to 12.3% proficiency, ranking 21st in the state.\nDuring the meetingThursday, Jodi Colman, the district's assistant superintendent of academics and student services, showed proficiency rates and rankings in the state broken down by grade level.\nColman said there were eight grade levels where the district's state ranking in math increased and six grade levels where the district's state ranking in English increased.\nIn fifth grade science, where 14.4% of students were considered proficient on the 2024 MCAP assessment, the ranking went up to 20th in the state for 2024 compared to 22nd the previous year.\nColman said that at a statewide assistant superintendent meeting recently, Dorchester County was mentioned for its growth in third grade math, sixth grade math and middle school algebra.\n\"I thought that was nice to be highlighted across the state as seeing a district that is actually moving some of their scores,\" she said after mentioning that math scores across the state were pretty stagnant in the 2024 MCAP compared to the previous year.\nColman also brought up concerns regarding district MCAP scores.\nAccording to the data Colman shared, 30.6% of 10th graders scored proficient on the English assessment last school year, ranking last in the state.\nColman said the district is looking at its support pathway classes, which it hopes will affect the 10th grade data \"more significantly.\"\nColman also brought up elementary English scores. She said that as students go up in grade, English proficiency levels decrease.\nColman said there have been discussions about whether the district should resume using its instructional program for elementary English or adopt a new one. The district's language arts supervisor is researching this.\nMoving forward, the district is getting feedback from the state on a new comprehensive literacy plan, Colman said.\n\"We are also looking at, across the board, our tier one instruction for any content level,\" she said. \"Making sure that we're really using that instructional planning model, that we're thinking through strategically with our students and that do we have good, formative assessment data to use in order to change teaching within our classrooms. And I think we have a lot of work to do in that area.\"\nColman said that although the MCAP scores aren't \"exactly where we want them,\" there is hope in the county about increasing the scores going forward.\n\"So I'm excited about that,\" she said.\nAfter Colman's presentation, Superintendent Jymil Thompson said although the score increases might not be \"monumental,\" they show progress.\n\"If we continue that progress over the years, it will add up,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said the purpose of the plan is to guide the work of the district from 2025 through 2028.\n\"This is kind of a long run for a strategic planning process,\" she said. \"So we want to be really inclusive. We want to be very engaging and come up with something that feels just a little bit scary but very doable for DCPS.\"\nCasson said the questions they want to answer in developing this plan include how to best prepare students, how to recruit and retain the best teachers and staff, how to provide students with opportunities to explore careers in local industries, and how to do best with the resources available.\nTo create the plan, Casson said September and October will be spent reviewing district data and understanding where the district is right now.\n\"This will include student surveys, parent surveys and staff surveys,\" she said.\nIn the coming months, through June, time will be spent researching and exploring what other districts are doing, prioritizing strengths and new initiatives, making plans and turning those plans into budgets, communicating district priorities to local partners, and starting to plan for next school year and beyond.\nCasson said Integrated Impact Group will give monthly updates to the board. She said they have set up an email account, planning@dcpsmd.org, that people can reach out to.\nThe district and Integrated Impact Group will be holding three community meetings for residents to share their ideas and priorities for the school years ahead.

From elementary after school programs to financial aid education, the organization has made it possible for families from the area's growing immigrant communities to achieve different levels of education.\nAccording to Victoria Gomez Lozano, the scholarship was established about four years ago and has slowly gained more funds to extend its assistance.\nGomez Lozano said there is no set criteria for an applicant to be awarded this scholarship, but it is designed for students who may not have a family history of attending higher education institutions.\n\"The two main things is first college generation and the need of the financial because sometimes some of the applicants are not eligible for all the scholarships, including FAFSA,\" Gomez Lozano said.\nAccording to Gomez Lozano, the funds provided by this scholarship have been used for a variety of aspects of academia including the purchase of laptops, books and dorm fees.\nMorgan Lewis, an awardee of the scholarship program, said it is her overall goal to continue her education toward a masters and possible doctorate in psychology. Lewis said she is thankful for the scholarship because without the additional funds, she would have needed to take out loans for her undergraduate degree.\n\"With the support of Chesapeake Multicultural Center, I have been able to further my academic career at two different locations in order to get my undergraduate degree in psychology with the hopes to be able to help others who may not be so lucky and have those financial struggles or any number of other struggles,\" Lewis said.\nGomez Lozano said she is proud that the center has provided opportunities for so many students and encourages everyone, regardless of academic background, to apply for the scholarship.\n\"I think it's important because a lot of students don't know that they can have the opportunity to go to college,\" Gomez Lozano said. \"\u2026 So I just think it's very important, because the way they know that they can take advantage of the opportunity to make their dreams come true.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Team members shared their inspiring story, detailing the design failures they overcame in the process of building their electric boats, which eventually led to the team's success, winning first place in multiple races against other teams from universities with large engineering programs.Electric Boat Team President Douglas Hewes, a member of RCS' Class of 2018, spoke, along with WC students Mac Sansbury, Tiyaba Jamil, and Team Advisor Brian Palmer, about the strategies they used to design their boats each year and remain competitive against teams like Princeton University.\nBy thoughtfully building better batteries, stronger electric motors, more efficient solar technology, and hydrodynamic hull designs, they were able to start bringing home top place awards. Palmer noted, \"Our students are taking away technical insights that are valuable of course, but perhaps more important is the practice they are getting at recognizing problems to solve, learning how to design solutions, and not getting dissuaded when things don't always turn out as they hoped. It's a great opportunity for them to build technical capabilities as well as perseverance and grit that is needed to see complex projects through to fruition.\"\nPalmer excitedly shared the news about the team's most recent success\u2013breaking the Guinness World Record for the greatest distance by an electric boat on a single charge without solar Sept. 2. WC team broke the previous world record by 21 miles. Hewes remarked, \"When we were building the trimaran, we didn't even think about beating a world record or even thought we could\u2026Then, we did the calculations and then we realized, hey, we might actually be able to beat the record.\"\nThe students had the opportunity to watch video footage of the record-breaking success and see the winning boat in person, as well as to ask questions about the boat's design and the team's plans for the future. \"We are grateful to the Washington College Electric Boat Team for sharing their story about how they overcame failure to find success. It's important for our students to hear that it's okay to try hard and come up short; in all good design thinking, failure is just part of the learning process. It was apparent from the number of hands in the air and the thoughtful student questions that this remarkable story had a real impact on our young learners,\" said Head of School Peter Thayer.\nTo learn more about the Electric Boat Team at Washington College, visit WACElectricBoat.com \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Washington College Electric Boat Team visits Radcliffe Creek School\n\n October 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Local News \n \n 413\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN \u2014 Radcliffe Creek School students were treated to a special presentation by the Washington College Electric Boat Team Sept. 20. Team members shared their inspiring story, detailing the design failures they overcame in the process of building their electric boats, which eventually led to the team's success, winning first place in multiple races against other teams from universities with large engineering programs.Electric Boat Team President Douglas Hewes, a member of Radcliffe's Class of 2018, spoke, along with Washington College students Mac Sansbury, Tiyaba Jamil, and team adviser Brian Palmer, about the strategies they used to design their boats each year and remain competitive against teams like Princeton University.\nBy thoughtfully building better batteries, stronger electric motors, more efficient solar technology, and hydrodynamic hull designs, they were able to start bringing home top place awards. Palmer noted, \"Our students are taking away technical insights that are valuable of course, but perhaps more important is the practice they are getting at recognizing problems to solve, learning how to design solutions, and not getting dissuaded when things don't always turn out as they hoped. It's a great opportunity for them to build technical capabilities as well as perseverance and grit that is needed to see complex projects through to fruition.\"\nPalmer excitedly shared the news about the team's most recent success \u2014 breaking the Guinness World Record for the greatest distance by an electric boat on a single charge without solar Sept. 2. The Washington team broke the previous world record by 21 miles.\nHewes remarked, \"When we were building the trimaran, we didn't even think about beating a world record or even thought we could. \u2026 Then, we did the calculations and then we realized, hey, we might actually be able to beat the record.\"\nThe students had the opportunity to watch video footage of the record-breaking success and see the winning boat in person, as well as to ask questions about the boat's design and the team's plans for the future.\n\"We are grateful to the Washington College Electric Boat Team for sharing their story about how they overcame failure to find success. It's important for our students to hear that it's OK to try hard and come up short; in all good design thinking, failure is just part of the learning process. It was apparent from the number of hands in the air and the thoughtful student questions that this remarkable story had a real impact on our young learners,\" Head of School Peter Thayer said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was a tutor and a babysitter and she helped me run my Girl Scout troop for her younger sister.\"\nMadison never got the chance to realize her dream of following in the footsteps of several family members and becoming a teacher. The 17-year-old Newark Charter School junior was murdered by her ex-boyfriend and another friend in Delaware four years ago this month.\nHer dream lives on, however, through five Newark Charter students who have received scholarships in Madison's name to pursue a career in education.\n\"I call them my girls,\" Murphy said, describing the close bond she has with the scholarship recipients. \"They're like my kids. They all keep in contact with me.\"\nThe first recipient, Kristen White, is nearly done with her degree and recently started her student-teaching assignment.\n\"She said to me, 'Miss Heather, as hard as it is...I remember I'm doing this for Madison,'\" Murphy said. \"And that gets me.\"\nMurphy raises money for the scholarship through the annual Love Wins 5K. Now in its fourth year, the race drew more than 200 people to Glasgow Park on Saturday.\n\"I definitely cry every year,\" Murphy said. \"It's really emotional, but it also means so much to me and helps me continue to go on and keep her memory alive. You can't even put words on that. I mean, that's what I live for.\"\nThe Madison Sparrow Scholarship is awarded each year to a Newark Charter senior pursuing a career in education, and the recipients can reapply for funding each year. Last year, Murphy was able to give a scholarship to two deserving seniors.\nMadison was killed Oct. 2, 2020, after her supposed friend Annika Stalczynski lured her into the woods behind Maclary Elementary School, where Madison's ex-boyfriend Noah Sharp fatally struck her with a baseball bat. They then dumped her body near Interstate 95.\nBoth Sharp and Stalczynski were convicted of first-degree murder in 2022 and are serving lengthy prison sentences.\nMurphy is involved with the nonprofit Victims' Voices Heard and recently participated in the organization's victim-offender dialog program, which allowed her to sit down with Stalczynski and talk about the murder and how losing her daughter affected her.\n\"It was a beautiful experience,\" Murphy said. \"I'm sure it's not for every victim, but as Madison's mom, because I knew these children so well, it was something that I needed from the beginning.\"\nBoth Murphy and Stalczynski spent five months meeting separately with a mediator and then spent four hours speaking with each other. As hard as it was to face her daughter's murderer, Murphy felt she had to get answers from Stalczynski.\n\"She was with my daughter when she was murdered, so there's only that truth, there's only those answers,\" Murphy said. \"And she was very honest with me. Because I was here when Madison was brought into the world, I needed to know how Madison left it, and she was able to give me all the answers.\"\nThe meeting helped Murphy process her grief.\n\"I'll never have closure, but it definitely closed the chapter on the things I needed to know,\" she said. \"I said everything I needed to say and I received everything I needed to learn.\"\nMurphy already forgave Sharp and Stalczynski \u2014 both of whom she knew well before Madison's murder \u2014 during her victim impact statement during their sentencing.\n\"Forgiveness is something, I truly believe, that we do for ourselves not something that I do for the people that murdered my daughter,\" she said. \"It's also just the way that Madison lived her life, and that's the whole message of 'love wins.'\"\nMurphy continues to hear stories about Madison when she sees her daughter's friends and former teachers.\n\"The community outpouring and love just shows me how much people love my daughter and how much she impacted our community,\" she said. \"It continues every year with this race, and it's a beautiful way for me to see that and be surrounded and for us all to be together.\"\nMadison, Murphy said, \"was an amazing soul.\"\n\"She just loved children, and they loved her back,\" she said. \"She was a gentle soul, she loved her friends, she was so loyal to everyone, just an amazing daughter.\"\nTo donate to the Madison Sparrow Scholarship Fund, visit runsignup.com/Race/DE/Newark/LoveWins5KDE. Murphy is also looking for sponsors for next year's race. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "How Maryland schools are cracking down on cell phones this fall\n\n October 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MADISON KORMAN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 387\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Classrooms across Maryland are a bit more quiet this fall, with students under new rules to keep their phones off and out of sight.At least a third of Maryland public schools have tightened up the rules this fall, according to a Capital News Service survey conducted this month.\nMeanwhile, public schools in and around Baltimore are cracking down on phones during instruction \u2014 and, in some cases, even on the bus.\nIn Caroline County, on the eastern shore of Maryland, public schools have a new pilot program in two middle schools. It requires students to place their phones in locked pouches. The pouches stay with the students but remain locked until the end of the school day.\n\"Today's youth battle constant distraction caused by cell phone alerts and messaging that interrupt their ability to focus,\" Supt. Derek L. Simmons said in a recent notice to students and parents. He said this \"creates a negative impact on school culture and learning.\"\nElsewhere, administrators are getting creative about persuading students to go along with the plan.\nIn St. Mary's County, Supt. Scott Smith recently released a video describing the district's new plan to limit the distractions caused by cell phones.\nIn the video, he comically stops midway through his presentation of the new rules to take out his phone and text, showing students how difficult it can be to have a conversation when they are disengaged and on their phones.\n\"Hold on, just wait a second, I'm just going to text him real fast,\" Smith said in the video, pretending to send a message.\n\"That's really rude isn't it?\" he then pointed out. \"We're supposed to be having a conversation, and I'm interrupting myself and I'm getting on my phone and I'm texting.\"\n\"I'm not really here right?\" Smith said. \"I'm kind of distracted.\"\nSince the start of the school year, in St. Mary's County, they have confiscated around 30 cell phones per day, Smith told the school board in a recent meeting. That's out of 10,000 students, he said at the meeting.\n\"We have had many conversations about the joy of being in a classroom without the distraction of cell phones,\" Smith said, adding that he and his staff \"continue to work with our secondary students about the joy and some of the challenges of cellular devices and how we can maximize our joy and fun in life.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Incumbent Candace Henry and Ann O'Connor are squaring off for the District 2 seat. In District 5, incumbent Anna Howie and Karla Wieland-Cherry are running.\nThe District 6 seat, currently held by Mary Wheeler, is a race between Kerry Gunshenan and Cynthia Jurrius.\nHenry, O'Connor, Howie and Jurrius attended Wednesday's town hall, answering moderator and audience questions. Wieland-Cherry and Gunshenan did not attend.\nTEST SCORESScores released in August showed slight improvements in math and English proficiency rates in the district. The four candidates, though, were adamant that test scores must improve.\nIn English, 47.3% of Talbot County Public Schools students tested proficient, a jump of 2.8% from 44.5% in 2022-2023. In math, 18.3% of students were proficient, up 1.1% from 17.2% the year prior. The district slots in 14th and 18th, respectively, in those categories among the state's 24 districts.\n\"Our scores are not what we want,\" Henry said. She added that an increase in math coaches in the elementary schools and other forms of benchmark testing are current district initiatives.\n\"Standardized testing is a snapshot in a period of time,\" Henry said. \"(Superintendent Sharon) Pepukayi has worked with her team to really be intentional about gathering data from students on a more consistent basis.\"\nIn recent months, county residents have received flyers in the mail questioning the test scores, along with district spending and, most recently, a health education framework bill proposed at the state level.\n\"These flyers that came out are pretty alarming,\" O'Connor said. \"And I don't look at them as a negative on teachers. Teachers don't want these scores. The system is broken.\"\nO'Connor, who is backed by Talbot County's chapter of Moms for Liberty, a nationwide conservative political organization, said a lack of \"meaningful homework\" is a \"deficiency.\" She advocated for summer reading and said the district should look at what nearby private schools are doing in order to raise TCPS test scores.\nJurrius, who along with Henry and Howie is endorsed by the Talbot County Education Association labor union, addressed the most recent mailer sent to residents. That mailer stated, in part, that \"radical politicians are more worried about forcing harmful gender ideology\" on students, referencing a state Senate bill from 2023 that did not pass.\nJurrius stated she does not believe educators are indoctrinating students.\n\"This destructive polarization isn't helpful,\" Jurrius said. \"And whoever is behind it, (I) would love to see them contribute in a positive way. I think if we all work together, we can do some amazing things to increase our schools' test scores.\"\nSTUDENT ENGAGEMENTAcross the state, many districts are exploring ways to reduce cell phone use and other distractions in schools. TCPS has plans to roll out a pilot program for cell phone pouches sometime after Thanksgiving.\nHowie, an assistant principal at Federalsburg Elementary School in Caroline County, said Caroline County's current pilot of those same cell phone pouches has been a success.\n\"You can see engagement going through the roof,\" Howie said.\nShe emphasized that technology should be an addition to student learning and not the sole focus. \"A computer isn't a replacement, right. A computer should be a tool,\" she said.\nO'Connor said the same of computers. She said cell phones do not belong in schools and added she hopes to see an increased focus on books.\n\"Going back to the basics,\" O'Connor said. \"Are we reading books? Are books coming home? \u2026 I don't see them as much.\"\nJurrius advocated for \"restorative practices\" in student discipline to hold students accountable for actions. She said suspensions aren't always the solution.\n\"Students right now are different,\" Jurrius said. \"They have different challenges in their lives, their social media, their mental health issues.\"\nTEACHER RETENTIONCandidates discussed the need for effective recruitment and retention of teachers and staff amid shortages in the district, along with strategies to rectify those shortcomings.\nHowie emphasized the importance of retaining teachers and staff. She said looking at intent forms earlier will help the district and board understand why teachers leave.\n\"Being very intentional in having those conversations early \u2026 instead of getting that intent form at the end of the year and just start tallying up,\" Howie said.\nHenry added that the district should especially consider the feedback from teachers and staff that decide to stay. She hopes to see specific attention dedicated toward the district's \"Grow Your Own Teachers\" scholarship program.\n\"We should be growing teachers from our communities that can come back and teach in our communities,\" Henry said.\nResidents in Districts 2, 5 and 6 will see the respective school board candidates on the ballot on Election Day, which is Nov. 5. The three candidates elected will serve four-year terms. \n\n (c) Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I want to clarify that this is not true. I have not received endorsements from Mom's For Liberty or any other group.I have attended meetings hosted by the local M4L Chapter to better understand their perspectives and issues. This is one of my guiding principles \u2014 to attend meetings in the community to gather information so I can make my own decisions. At the last meeting, our superintendent, assistant superintendents and director of communications for TCPS were present as guest speakers, highlighting the ongoing dialogue between our school system and the community.\nPeople may incorrectly label me according to their perspectives, based on where I go, what groups I frequent, and in what activities I'm involved, but my focus remains clear: I am committed to the children of this county, our dedicated teachers and the importance of parental involvement. Collaboration among the three groups is essential to elevate our schools; it's a three legged stool \u2014 if one leg falters, the entire system is compromised.\nIf elected to the school board, I will prioritize listening to all voices to make informed decisions. My platform is based on the ABC's of education: Advancing Academics, Boosting Accountability and Cultivating Character. These principles will guide my decision making and efforts to improve our schools.\nTogether, let's strive for excellence and overcome mediocrity in our educational system. It would be an honor and privilege to serve as your school board member.\nANN O'CONNOR\nEaston \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The conservative candidates are: Ann O'Connor (District 2), Karla Wieland-Cherry (District 5), and Kerry Gunshenan (District 6). The progressive candidates are: Cynthia Jurrius ( District 6), Anna Howie (District 5) and Candace Henry (District 2).\nAs a public service, the local chapter of a parent support group called Moms for Liberty hosted a debate for the school board candidates on Sept. 23 at the Easton firehouse. All six candidates were invited; four appeared, including Cynthia Jurrius and the three conservatives Ann O'Connor, Karla Wieland-Cherry and Kerry Gunshenan. The event was a success and helpful for parents and grandparents in deciding for whom they will vote to sit on the local school board. Another school board candidates' debate was held on Wednesday, Oct. 2, at 6 p.m. at the Avalon Theater and all six candidates were invited to speak.\nWhile Moms for Liberty, according to several public statements made by the chapter Chair Jan Greenhawk, does not endorse any of the candidates, the Moms have been accused in a local periodical of \"inserting their partisan candidates into a non-partisan position.\" Such an accusation is surprising in light of the fact that another school board candidates' debate was held at the Academy Art Museum, sponsored by the Talbot County Democratic Forum.\nSadly, only three of the candidates were invited to speak. And guess which three. Yes, the three more progressive candidates, who happen to be Democrats. The other three candidates, the three conservative candidates, were not invited at all. And yet Moms for Liberty, which has not endorsed a single candidate, is accused of partisanship? Why are liberals so afraid to hear the opinions of conservatives, especially as regards our children's education? Is it that conservatives put children's well-being ahead of the latest fads of social-engineering and psychological manipulation? Is it because conservatives want to truly educate the children rather than indoctrinating them with left-wing philosophies?\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She volunteers with many local organizations. Wieland-Cherry said she grew up in a home that kept up with and often interacted with politics, both local and national. She is married and has two children.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI am running for the Talbot County Board of Education to work to improve our local school system for students, parents and our community.\nGoals I hope to achieve will be to improve test scores by enticing more qualified teachers to teach in Talbot County and retaining current teachers; raising education benchmark standards; increase use of CTE programs; improve student discipline rules; improve school safety measures; improve open communication transparency between schools, teachers, administration and parents and the community.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nAfter speaking with teachers in different grades at local schools, the constant concern I hear is the lack of student discipline and their safety as teachers. Teachers can't teach and students can't learn\u2026 and test scores can't improve\u2026 and teachers won't want to come teach in a county\u2026 if they are in an environment where everyone feels unsafe.\nTeachers have a distrust of the current board and feel that they don't listen to them and take their concerns seriously. I want to rebuild that trust by listening to teacher concerns and addressing those in a more supportive manner to make necessary changes.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nLack of teachers and staff seems to be the biggest issue. As I mentioned already in the prior questions, my priority will be to listen to teachers and rebuild the trust that is currently missing with the present board.\nI will also work to improve communication between schools, teachers, parents and the community and work to create a more secure learning environment for everyone.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nEveryone should take their own initiative to investigate local school data from reliable resources. These postcards are one way of bringing awareness to the community and open communication channels amongst parents, teachers, administration and the board to ask questions about their authenticity.\nIn speaking with many parents of all grade levels of students, I consistently hear that there is no open communication, especially with the current board.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nTeachers I've spoken with are frustrated and don't know Blueprint well, and what they do know is vague with no clear guidelines to how it's implemented. Funding Blueprint is based on inequities of and poverty levels of students for priority funding. Blueprint prioritizes equity learning.\nWe need to recognize every student's individuality and work to strengthen those individual skills for college/career readiness. We need to stop looking at certain groups as \"minorities\" and overlooking their skills as worthy individuals capable of learning instead of trying to make everyone \"equal\" to someone else. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was appointed to the post by Gov. Wes Moore in October, 2023.Howie is the assistant principal at Federalsburg Elementary School. She is married and has three children.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI am running for the District 5 seat of the Talbot County Board of Education to represent students, families and other stakeholders. We are making gains in our school district, and I want to continue to ensure that our students and teachers have access to high quality instructional materials that will have an impact on student achievement and success.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy priorities align with the goals set by the members of the Board of Education and the superintendent, Dr. (Shraron) Pepukayi. My two main areas of focus are increasing student achievement in the areas of mathematics and reading, and recruiting and retaining quality teachers.\nHaving teachers that provide outstanding instruction to our students will ensure that our students will be academically successful.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces, and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now is providing exceptional education opportunities for all students while being fiscally responsible.\nCurrently, the curriculum coordinating committee has brought high quality resources to the board for approval in the areas of reading and mathematics. These resources are paid for through educational grants. Utilizing grants is a responsible way of ensuring that we are providing our students with high quality instructional materials while being fiscally responsible.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nThe postcards that have been mailed out focused on student test scores as well as other concerns. In terms of student test scores, we have purchased new high quality instructional materials. Our 2024 data reflects growth in all subgroups as well as certain subject areas and grades.\nStudent test scores are not just a concern for our district but across the State. Through the Governance and Accountability pillar of the Blueprint, expert review teams will be visiting schools across the state to review literacy and mathematics instruction in our classrooms and provide quality feedback for improvement.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nI believe that the pillars of the Blueprint reflect the areas that all Maryland Schools want to address. Those pillars address early childhood education, high quality and diverse teachers, college and career readiness, more resources for students to be successful, and governance and accountability.\nThe Blueprint identifies and prioritizes the needs that we see in our district and across the state. In order for our students to be college and career ready by 10th grade, we need to start addressing their needs in pre-Kindergarten and ensure that they are receiving the resources they need to be successful in every grade. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With a background in mediation and youth, school, family and community conflict resolution, I listen to all perspectives and value the richness in diversity of opinion.\nI am a collaborative problem solver, skilled at helping people work together to solve complex community challenges.

We have many strengths on which to build; together, we can solve any challenge.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy priorities are interrelated: fostering academic excellence, supporting educators and creating a thriving school environment. I am committed to advancing student mastery of essential skills, improving academic proficiency and preparing students for college and careers.\nEnsuring we recruit, retain and support outstanding teachers is key to this vision. Equally important is providing a positive, safe, effective and inclusive school climate where all learners can succeed and promoting strong family and student engagement to build a collaborative, supportive community around our schools. Together, these priorities create the foundation for a bright future for our students.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nAdvancing academic proficiency is a priority. Supporting a positive, safe, effective and inclusive learning environment is fundamental for student success, as well as teacher retention. Finding innovative ways to engage families, including non-English speakers, and students will support all aspects of student success.\nThe current board and superintendent are making progress toward addressing these issues despite many challenges, such as the COVID-19 learning gap. Through additional instructional support, expanding use of innovative community partnerships, strategic use of technology, targeted allocation of resources and engaging all sectors of our community, we can accelerate progress in these areas.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nI would like to see the sender of the mailers come forward for productive and honest dialogue. While improving academic proficiency is essential, the harmful attacks on our teachers, fueled by misleading and inflammatory rhetoric, seem aimed at undermining our public schools and inciting fear.\nI would welcome an open, honest conversation about what this group seeks to accomplish, with accurate, relevant information. Let's work together to lift our Talbot County Public Schools to be the vibrant foundation of our community, where education is valued, everyone can belong and our teachers receive the support they need and deserve.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint for Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nThe creation of the Blueprint was the result of a comprehensive effort with input from many stakeholders. The five pillars are: Early Childhood Education; High Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders; College and Career Readiness; More Resources for Student Success; and Governance and Accountability.\nThe TCPS team has a detailed plan for managing the Blueprint and provides regular reports on progress for public view. There are many areas of the Blueprint that are positive, however, the most challenging aspects are mandates without sufficient funding. I support continued efforts to address the funding formula as it has been applied to Talbot County. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She is running for the District 2 seat on the Talbot County Board of Education.She is a former teacher and has six children.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI am running for the school board because I am deeply passionate about children's education. As a former teacher and mother of six, I have dedicated my career to helping children reach their highest potential.\nHaving witnessed my six children go through (Talbot County Public School), I have observed a decline in academic rigor, expectations and accountability, both in behavior and academics. This experience drives my desire to make meaningful changes on the school board. The fact that our students are scoring 18% proficient in math and 55% in reading indicates a pressing need for new perspectives on our educational strategies.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy priorities are the ABCs of education: advancing academics, boosting accountability and cultivating character. The focus is on the whole child. We cannot advance academics without discipline.\nWhen students develop self-discipline, good character naturally emerges. This requires daily practice and consistent reinforcement of rules and clear expectations for all students across all buildings. Disruptive behavior must be addressed promptly and effectively.\nRegarding academic accountability: A 95% graduation rate when less than \u00bc of our students are proficient in math skills, and less than \u00bd are reading on grade level is inconsistent \u2014 something is broken here and we need to fix it.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most important issue is the steady decline of academic rigor. We need to make sure we continue to implement early intervention in elementary schools to support those who need that extra push. It's essential to send home books and ensure that our children have access to/and are accountable for reading materials throughout elementary, middle and high school.\nWe should place greater emphasis on traditional learning \u2014 using pencils and paper, cursive writing, fostering reading and critical thinking skills, while reducing reliance on computers. We need to offer pathways for middle school students interested in college or the workforce, including advanced/honors classes.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nThe postcards received in the mail are snapshots of where our schools stand. No one wants these scores, they are abysmal. It's a wake up call to attack the problem and change the way we have been doing education here in Talbot County.\nWe need to put our focus on reading, writing and math. Our students are distracted. Let's eliminate anything that detracts from our mission as educators and focus on what truly matters \u2014 educating the child. Let's get back to basics with my ABCs of education.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nSimply changing a name doesn't lead to improvement. Over the last two decades, this initiative has gone through four name changes. Although there are many wonderful proposals in the Blueprint, I don't believe that top-down programs created by education experts would make our local schools better.\nThe Blueprint is a blanket principle mandated for all 24 counties in Maryland. The counties have no say in how it is implemented. It removes the schools from the control of locally elected school boards and puts control in the hands of unelected officials. I believe we want control over our local schools. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

She lives in Easton with her family of four.Henry is the director of the Disability Resource Center at Salisbury University.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI am running for reelection to the Board of Education to ensure that every student, regardless of ability, background or language, has equal access to quality education. My focus on accessibility, equity and belonging stems from a commitment to create inclusive learning environments where all students feel valued and supported.\nI believe in breaking down barriers to success, advocating for diverse voices and fostering a sense of community in our schools. By addressing the unique needs of all learners, I aim to promote educational outcomes that empower every student to reach their full potential.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy priorities are consistent with TCPS' current philosophy of \"transforming and performing.\" I want the public to know that the Board of Education operates as a collective and is not driven by individual agendas.\nI am committed to the collective goals to prioritize narrowing and closing the opportunity and achievement gaps, eliminating barriers to education, recruiting and retaining high-quality educators, enhancing special education services, continuous improvement in reading and math proficiency, enhancing our summer school offerings, and early access to college preparatory, dual enrollment, and CTE programs.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most important issue facing (Talbot County Public Schools) is the opportunity gap, which directly affects reading and math proficiency for all students. To address this, the board must continue to prioritize equitable distribution of resources, ensuring that schools serving higher-need populations have access to targeted interventions.\nSimultaneously, recruiting and retaining high-quality educators is vital, as teachers are the foundation of student success. By investing in professional development and creating supportive environments for educators, we can close the opportunity gap and improve outcomes and opportunities for all students.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nThe postcards critical of Talbot County's education system are deeply troubling because they disparage the hard work of our educators. Much of the content includes outdated and inaccurate information, which undermines trust in our schools and the dedicated professionals working to support our students.\nThese types of messages are circulated with the intent to create division rather than foster productive dialogue. To address these concerns, we must continue to engage the community in open discussion, lead with facts \u2014 highlighting the progress being made and the work that still needs to be done, all while celebrating the efforts of our educators.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future presents significant benefits by prioritizing equity, early childhood education and career readiness, which can help close the opportunity gap and enhance student success. It also aims to improve educator salaries and professional development, which are crucial for recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers.\nMy concern is ensuring that the funding remains sustainable and that implementation is equitable, especially for rural areas like Talbot County. It's essential that all schools receive the resources needed to meet these ambitious goals, with careful oversight to ensure progress and accountability across the state. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She has also served as president of the Advisory Board for St. Michaels YMCA.She has been married for 22 years and has five children ranging from 14 to 20 years old. She is running for the District 6 seat on the Board of Education.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI'm running for office because I have seen a decline in education since my oldest child started in (Talbot County Public Schools). I believe all our children deserve better. No one is going to care more or be more passionate about solving issues that face our schools today than a mother with four children in the system. I care deeply about our schools, I pay attention, and I love our community. I'm a mom who wants to prioritize education and improve outcomes.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy top priority is to ensure all students are college or career ready by the time they graduate. I want to see all students obtain critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, it's important for students to have personal responsibility, financial literacy, strong communication, and respect for themselves and others. With the combination of these skills, our children will have a bright future.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nCandidate choose not to answer.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nThe recent postcards have highlighted the decline in student performance on standardized tests. I believe this is not about placing blame but about transparency.\nIt brings the issue to the attention of Talbot County residents, which positions us better to solve the problem. Once we realize where we are today, we can determine where we want to go and how to get there. If everyone can unite around a common goal of increasing test scores in reading and math, we can more quickly work together to solve this issue.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's future mandates so many requirements that it's difficult for our local school system to continue programs they feel are successful. Having the authority to make decisions at the local level will allow citizens of Talbot County to address the needs of our community schools more effectively. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Upon entering the school, students will place their phones in the pouches and use a Yondr magnet to lock the pouch. During dismissal, students will use the same magnetic device to unlock the pouches and retrieve their phones.\nEinhorn said the district has talked to Yondr representatives about ensuring there are enough magnets in case of an emergency.\n\"They've been able to share with us some best practices, which include how many magnets you would need per student in the building to be able to effectively and efficiently get students out at the end of the day,\" Einhorn said.\nLike Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said prior to his district's rollout, Einhorn emphasized that cell phones can be a distraction during emergencies.\n\"We've had conversations and heard from national experts that during a real school emergency, it is actually greater safety risk for 800 students to be pulling out their phones and making phone calls instead of listening to the directions that will help keep them safe,\" she told board members.\nDebbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools, said each pouch costs about $27. In all, 975 pouches were purchased for a total just below $27,000, \"paid for from the local FY24 materials of instruction budget,\" Gardner said.\nBoard Vice President Candace Henry asked how long it will take students to put their phones in pouches and retrieve them at the beginning and end of each day. Einhorn and Pepukayi said they expect it will take some time at first but that the process should become simple and streamlined over time.\nEaston Middle families will receive more details from the district about the pouch program later this week, and a presentation will be given to students on Friday.\nBoard Member Deborah Bridges inquired if the pilot program may extend to other schools in the district this year if it is deemed successful.\n\"I do think we will need to see at least this year what our data is telling us about the impact,\" Einhorn said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Those included Easton High School stadium lights, an Easton Elementary basketball court, a St. Michaels Elementary playground replacement, Easton High auditorium light replacements and an artificial turf field at the high school.\nChief Financial Officer Sarah Jones told the board that the first three projects have been funded with grants. On Wednesday, Jones presented a modified list of potential capital projects. The auditorium lights and artificial turf field remained on that list.\nThree projects were new to that list on Wednesday: HVAC unit replacements at Easton High for $1,100,000, LED lights at St. Michaels Middle High School for $566,000, and field improvements across the district for $200,000, the latter of which stemmed from concerns raised at a Sept. 18 board meeting about the safety and upkeep of high school fields in the county.\nBoard President Emily Jackson expressed concern that new projects would continue to usurp side projects, such as the artificial turf field, which is projected to cost around $1.8 million alone.\n\"Something's always going to take priority, which is why I'm saying (pull from our) fund balance, because that's what it's for, it's for those side projects that are never going to take priority,\" Jackson said.\nJackson and other board members recognized that the HVAC improvements and LED lights are necessary. Director of Operations Kevin Shafer said the district proposed HVAC improvements in a capital improvement plan to the state, and that the aging units can make it a couple more years before state funding may come through.\nShafer and Jones added that funds for field improvements could be sought through maintenance budget requests or adjustments. Shafer emphasized in order to increase field quality, his team needs better equipment \"to do better maintenance.\"\nThe board unanimously approved a motion from Jackson to approve $817,321 for Easton High auditorium lights, $566,000 for LED lights at St. Michaels and the remaining $117,000 for athletic field projects in general. The projects will not begin until capital-enabling legislation is approved by the Talbot County Council.\nARTIFICIAL TURF FIELDMuch of Wednesday's back-and-forth between Shafer, Jones and the board centered on the potential of funding an artificial turf field at Easton High. It's a project that has received much community support, including from field hockey players and families.\nSome board members suggested the board consider using extra funds the district has to save toward the $1.8 million projected price tag.\n\"I think we should begin to lay down our concrete plan if that's the way we're going to go, of how we're going to fund it in the future and what that's going to look like,\" Board Vice President Candace Henry said.\nShafer said that if a new turf field is agreed upon, he believes it should be placed at the current stadium field. Jackson disagreed, citing previous presentations to the board regarding football injury risks on artificial turf.\n\"We could look at maybe fencing off a different field to make it a more appropriate and safe field for our athletes to be on,\" Jackson said.\n\"I would urge the board to consider whether that would be the most equitable use of funds,\" Shafer responded, \"\u2026 to just have a turf field for one sport, if it's going to be field hockey or whatever. I question whether that is a good investment in moving forward.\"\nNo official motions regarding funding for the turf project were made Wednesday, though Jackson keyed in on pushing the discussion forward.\n\"Safety for all of our athletes has to be the No. 1 priority,\" she said. \"Number two, very closely following that, is opportunity for our athletes, and I want to make sure that we are giving the most amount of opportunity to the most amount of kids.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He often stated that \"whenever the people are well informed, they can be trusted with their own government.\"As a country, I believe we should heed the words of our founding father as we head to the polls in November. Our democracy depends on it.\nEarlier this month, librarians, booksellers, educators, authors and readers throughout the country participated in Banned Books Week, the annual event that highlights the value of free and open access to information. In preparation, The American Library Association released preliminary data documenting attempts to censor books and materials in public, school, and academic libraries during the first eight months of 2024.\nThe findings are alarming: Between January 1 and August 31, 2024, ALA tracked 414 attempts to censor library materials and services. In those cases, 1,128 unique titles were challenged. Especially troubling is the fact that 47% of the books targeted for censorship are titles representing the voices and lived experiences of people of color and people who identify as LGBTQ+.\nThese attempts to silence diverse voices in our community are deliberate, coordinated and dangerous. Public and school libraries should be safe havens of knowledge and information, offering access to a variety of viewpoints and empowering readers to be informed citizens.\nThis Saturday, Oct. 19, has been designated the Freedom to Read Day of Action by Unite Against Book Bans, an organization dedicated to protecting the First Amendment rights of all Americans (uniteagainstbookbans.org). Concerned citizens can join in the fight against censorship by learning about book bans, reading a banned book or participating in the activities on the website. Above all, we can take the pledge to stand with readers across the U.S. in support of the Freedom to Read and vote.\nMARY PELLICANO\nEaston \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Thoughts on smart phone restrictions in schools\n\n October 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 981\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A recent Pew Research Center survey reports that 95% of teenagers in America have a smart phone or have access to one. It also reports that 45% of teenagers say they are online nearly all the time.Many have suggested this has resulted in a measurable and serious negative impact on the learning environment in middle and high school classrooms. Others have suggested this has resulted in a serious negative impact on standardized student achievement test scores.\nAs a result, countless school districts in America have put or will be putting new or more restrictions on student smart phones during the school day. Two-thirds of schools in Maryland have already. Talbot County is joining them. Beginning Dec. 2, Easton Middle School will will require students to lock their phones in secure pouches during the school day.\nThese restrictions have significant public support. Surveys conducted by the Talbot County school district reported 94% of parents/guardians and 96% of staff said there should be restrictions on cell phone use during the school day. 90% of parents/guardians and 95% of staff said students should not be allowed to have their phones \"visible and usable\" during class instruction.\nWhile I understand and respect these opinions, I suggest restrictions in schools are not addressing more deeply seated roots of the problem.\nIn his most recent book, \"The Anxious Generation How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness\" social psychologist Jonathan Stephen Haidt does a deep dive on a measurable surge in anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts among American youth.\nI understand and respect these decisions. At the same time, I suggest they are not addressing more deeply seated roots of the problem.\nIn his most recent book, \"The Anxious Generation How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness\" social psychologist Jonathan Stephen Haidt does a deep dive on a measurable surge in anxiety, depression, and suicidality among American youth.\nIn his book Haidt references research showing a measure of anxiety for individuals between ages of 8 to 25 has increased 139% between 2010 and 2020.The measure for depression during the same period, often the result of an inability to resolve interpersonal conflicts or relationship difficulties, has increased 106%.\nHaidt suggests three reasons why.\nThe first is the decline of the what Haidt calls play-based childhood. He maintains children need lots of free play time to prepare them for success as an adult. Out of fears for their safety, many American parents and guardians have reduced children's access to unsupervised free play. The loss of free play and the rise of continual (some may say \"smothering\") adult supervision has deprived children of what they needed most to overcome the normal fears and anxieties of childhood: the chance to explore, test and expand their limits, build close friendships through shared adventure and learn how to judge risks for themselves.\nThe second is what Haidt calls rise of the phone-based childhood, which began in the late 2000s and accelerated in the early 2010s. Haidt notes this was precisely the period during which adolescents traded in their flip phones for smartphones. These smartphones were loaded with social media platforms supported by the new high-speed internet and unlimited data plans that has drastically reshaped the social media landscape for adolescents.\nThe third is what Heidt calls an over reliance on technology that has all but eliminated unstructured face to face interactions from the lives of children and adolescents.\nHeidt concludes the negative impact of all three reasons was made worse by many well-intentioned parents, including himself. He writes: \"We did not fully understand what was happening in children's virtual worlds and did not grasp that tech companies had designed their online products to be addictive.\"\nAs a result, Haidt asserts that all these trends combined, have robbed entire generations of opportunities to develop the resilience, coping skills and independence needed to navigate everyday stressors, and in turn, created unprecedented levels of anxiety at a societal level.\nHe says these generations have not learned from valuable opportunities to engage in and learn from manageable risks, typical setbacks, failures and healthy social challenges.\nWhat can be done going forward?\nHaidt offers the following proactive suggestions for parents and guardians of children in elementary, middle and high schools.\nInstead of a giving younger students a smartphone as their first phone, give them a basic phone.\nDo not give them a smartphone until high school. Delay the opening of accounts on nearly all social media platforms until the beginning of high school, at least.\nWill his suggestions be popular with students? Not likely, especially given the immense power of peer pressure that characterizes life for students in schools at all levels.\nOne school in Maryland recently surveyed seniors on a new more restrictive smart phone policy to limit the overuse of smart phones during the school day. The questions and answers were: \"Do you know overuse of cell phones is harmful? Yes. Do you want to give it up? No.\"\nAre Haidt's suggestions still necessary since efforts are underway when an increasing number of schools are adopting on new or more restrictive rules on smart phone access? Yes.\nDespite best intentions and best efforts, schools alone cannot address this problem. One Maryland school district superintendent has observed with thinly disguised frustration \u2014 \"Students are in school for just 20% of their week. We can't control the other 80% of the time that we don't have them.\"\nThose with some control over most of the other 80% of student's time outside of school are parents and guardians.\nGoing forward, parents and guardians need to fully embrace two concepts. Success for them is not based on winning a popularity contest with those whom they are entrusted with their care and upbringing. Success for them is measured in part by a willingness to make sometimes unpopular, but necessary decisions on reasonable limits for a young person's own good.\nIn preparing all our young people for success, they, and our society deserve nothing less. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The service provided alternative education for up to 48 Dorchester County Public Schools elementary and middle school students at one time.\nBoard members did not comment on the decision to terminate the contract at the meeting.\nReview of the contract was not originally on Thursday's meeting agenda. The board voted to add it to the agenda after board member Chris Wheedleton made a motion to do so. Later in the meeting, Wheedleton made a motion to terminate the contract for convenience, which the board unanimously voted in favor of.\nWheedleton did not immediately respond for comment on the decision.\nAccording to the contract, either party can terminate it for any or no reason with 60-days advance written notice.\nThe program, called Positive Change Academy-Dorchester, began this past summer and was set to end June 30, 2025. It is housed at The Judy Center at Sandy Hill Elementary School and at the New Directions Learning Academy. It cost the district $79,000 per month.\nThe board approved the contract at a special Board of Education meeting in July. At that meeting, district Superintendent Jymil Thompson said the district looked at this program as one stop in a student's education journey. He said it would be a place where students could remedy behavior and improve academics before going back into a \"regular educational setting.\"\nThe district did not immediately respond for comment on the board's decision.\nThis is not the first time the board has terminated an alternative education contract in the past year.\nIn June, the Board of Education voted to terminate its more than three-year contract with Vision Quest, an alternative education program for district high schoolers that had been met with criticism from residents since the contract was approved in September 2023. The district had been paying Vision Quest $93,363 per month for services, which would have added up to over $3.3 million over three years.\nThe decision to terminate the Vision Quest contract was one of the reasons former Dorchester County Board of Education Vice President Susan Morgan resigned in June. She was the sole vote in favor of keeping the contract. In an interview with the Star Democrat in June, Morgan said the district needed an alternative program for the fall that would benefit the students as much as she witnessed first-hand with the success of Vision Quest. \n\n Copyright 2024",

    "content": "Group promotes extremist agenda\n\n October 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 402\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As a former teacher in Talbot County, I find the local school board races concerning. Ironically, hate groups in America like to name themselves after our most deeply held values, while acting against those values. Moms for Liberty (M4L) is one such group.Moms For Liberty has an active chapter here in Talbot County. Nationally, M4L was included as an extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, in its annual report because it advances an anti-student inclusion agenda.\nThe M4L definition of liberty is that we have the freedom to believe as they do. Our citizens need to know the extremist agenda of M4L evidenced below. Voters need to know that voting for their candidates will turn over the Board of Education majority to M4L.\nAccording to USA Today, the group, which identifies itself as a \"parental rights organization,\" is known for calls to ban books in schools. Founded in Florida, three members have been named to the Department of Education workgroup that oversees school libraries. One cannot help but wonder how influential they were in developing the new standards that require students be taught that being enslaved was beneficial to Black Americans because it helped them acquire new skills.\nI encourage you to speak with local Black citizens to hear their views on this.\nIt is critical in this election year that Talbot County voters reject the three candidates supported by the local Moms for Liberty chapter. I have seen the posts claiming that M4L supports, but doesn't endorse these candidates.\nEither these candidates did no homework into M4L or they know their agenda and concur. In my opinion, either option disqualifies Ann O'Connor, Karla Wieland-Cherry and Kerry Gunshenan. Candidates who can't be bothered to understand the agenda of the groups that support them are potential pawns in the hands of extremists. Candidates who agree with M4L would engulf our system in culture wars that do nothing to advance the education of our children.\nIf you live in a district with a school board race this election, one of these three names will appear: Candace Henry, Anna Howie or Cynthia Marrah Jurrius. I respectfully ask you to vote for one of them.\nI can promise you that the educators in this county truly want what is best for our children, and they are the ones qualified to make decisions about their education.\nMoms for Liberty's hateful rhetoric and anti-inclusive agenda does not belong anywhere in our schools.\nTARA LEESON\nEaston \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland school board candidates push for officers, mental health services\n\n October 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Emily R. Condon and Max Schaeffer Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1315\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In Montgomery County, school board candidate Brenda M. Diaz worries that \"knife-wielding vandals\" have easy access to schools because the district removed the police officers that are on hand in the rest of Maryland's public school districts to try to keep the peace.Across the state on the Eastern Shore, school board candidate Karla Wieland-Cherry of Talbot County told the Local News Network in a candidate survey that teachers feel threatened by some of their students.\nAnd in Howard County, school board candidate Andrea Chamblee \u2014 whose husband, John McNamara, was shot to death in the 2018 mass shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis \u2014 said the threat of a school shooting is just one of the stressors looming over the county's children.\n\"Bullying, mental health struggles, technology addiction, unreliable transportation, larger class sizes, fewer fine art enrichment opportunities, portable classrooms, overcrowding, poorly maintained buildings, food insecurity, poor indoor air quality and bigotry are all eroding the well-being of our students and staff,\" Chamblee said. \"Students who aren't well, can't learn well. In order to focus on academics, we must take on these safety challenges and provide students and staff with a stable learning environment.\"\nConcern about school safety in Maryland spans the state \u2014 which is why candidates in Maryland's school district races are stressing the issue. Of the 74 candidates who replied to a Local News Network questionnaire, 48 said they were not entirely satisfied with school safety in their district. Many called for adding more law enforcement officers as well as mental health counselors to their local schools.\nDiaz advocates returning school resource officers to Montgomery County schools \u2014 but statistics, and the comments of school board candidates statewide, make clear that school safety and student behavior aren't easily controlled just by in-school cops.\nSchool safety at a glanceThe school safety problem is a national one. Violent incidents increased 49% in the nation's schools the 2023-2024 school year, according to the Educator's School Safety Network.\nMaryland has not yet released its 2023-2024 statistics, but in the 2022-2023 school year, the number of anonymously reported bullying or cyberbullying incidents rose over the prior year from 91 to 107 , according to the Maryland Center for School Safety. The number of assaults and threats to cause harm increased from 83 to 98. And the number of general school safety complaints shot up from 62 to 104.\nThe school safety center also tracks critical life threatening incidents, which are defined as incidents that cause death or serious injury, or acts of mass violence under law. These incidents for the past three school years totaled 17, 18 and 18.\nAmong those incidents are the following:\nOn Oct. 27, 2023, at a Baltimore City high school, a student worked in tandem with both of his parents to assault and shoot three other students.In April 2024, Montgomery County Police arrested a high school senior who had written a 129-page manifesto on his plans for a school shooting.In January 2024, a high school student was arrested after threatening mass violence and arson at the school, the Somerset County Sheriff's Office said. The student had previously been caught with a gun at school, according to a county press release.\nSchool board candidate Matthew Warren Lankford, whose son was in the school at the time of that last incident, said that student is now back in school. \"This student needs special attention and should never be allowed back in the school as a normal student again,\" Lankford said.\nSchool resource officers\nSchool resource officers, the official name for trained officers in schools under Maryland's 2019 Safe to Learn Act, are posted in some schools in every Maryland jurisdiction except Montgomery County. And many school board candidates expressed support for hiring more school resource officers.\n\"I am satisfied with the safety for the big, catastrophic-type events,\" said Jaime Brennan, a Frederick County school board candidate. \"But I am not satisfied with the daily acts of violence\u2026that occur. I think that expanding the school resource officer program so that we have a designated SRO in each middle and high school would help.\"\nThe Maryland Center for School Safety is responsible for training school resource officers in the state and reports each year on their coverage in schools. The overall number of schools with a full-time officer on hand increased from 273 in 2021-2022 to 288 in the 2022-2023 school year.\nIn Calvert County, another candidate who is running for reelection, Antoine White, said he meets regularly with his board's safety liaison and local sheriff's department. White voted to increase the number of school resource officers in his district.\nBut another candidate in Calvert County, Paul Harrison, said he is not content with the lack of armed officers in six schools and pledged to try to fill those gaps.\nIn contrast, Montgomery County ended its school resource officer program in 2021 amid concerns that students of color were being disproportionately disciplined. The district now has a community engagement officer program, in which officers patrol near schools and enter schools as needed.\nA PTA president running for the school board in the county, Rita Montoya, said the officers allowed in schools must be properly vetted.\n\"Providing opportunities for healthy and positive engagement between students and officers is another necessary step,\" Montoya said.\nMore school districts opt for a constant, visible law enforcement presence. Worcester County Board of Education member Jon M. Andes touted his district as the first in the state to have school resource officers.\n\"We need to continue work with our law enforcement partners, enhance our summer safe schools retreat, and strengthen our proactive approach to preventing problems,\" said Andes, who is running for reelection.\nConversely, Gerry LaFemina worries about the use of officers in schools in Allegany County, where he is running for the school board.\n\"I loathe the idea of making our schools seem like they're under attack because that provides an atmosphere ripe for distraction,\" he said. \"I also worry about the use of police in the schools, which can often lead to escalation of problems rather than mediated solutions.\"\nOther than LaFemina, none of the 74 candidates who replied to a Local News Network survey questioned or opposed assigning police officers to schools.\nMore counselors?Many candidates made clear, though, that school resource officers can't solve the school safety problem alone. Twenty-five candidates mentioned increased mental health or counseling intervention as an important step in their survey response.\n\"Schools should prioritize not only physical safety but also students' social and emotional well-being,\" said Tiffini Andorful, a Prince George's County school board candidate. \"This could include increasing the number of support staff and providing access to resources and training to effectively handle conflicts. I also think there should be a greater emphasis on emergency preparedness and increased advocacy for gun control at higher levels.\"\nMany also emphasized the importance of building a healthy school atmosphere beginning when students are young.\n\"We really need to focus on social-emotional learning and fostering a culture of acceptance of others from the youngest grades and up,\" said Erica McFarland, an Anne Arundel County candidate.\nMcFarland said she feels that this type of focus can help to prevent bullying, a common reason for students to feel unsafe at school.\nMeg Ricks, a candidate in Howard County, said increased counseling services would likely stem other problems, too.\n\"We must start while students are young to give them tools for dealing with conflict and seeking help when needed,\" she said in her survey response. \"I would like to see more counselors in our schools so that we can provide students with productive solutions to the challenges they are facing.\"\nAt the same time, 13 candidates statewide said that the secret to solving the school safety puzzle lies not just in school resource officers and mental health services, but in old-fashioned school discipline.\n\"We need to re-address school discipline measures and take improved steps to reduce the threats and in some cases, violence,\" Wieland-Cherry of Talbot County said. \"Teaching and learning cannot take place in an environment (where) one feels unsafe.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Is Maryland\u2019s \u2018Blueprint\u2019 the path to better schools?\n\n October 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Marwa Barakat and Colin McNamara Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1365\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A 10-year, $30 billion plan out of Annapolis, the Blueprint for Maryland's Future aims to dramatically improve the state's public schools by boosting teacher salaries, expanding pre-kindergarten and rewriting the curriculum \u2014 and school board candidates say the state's schools need that improvement.\"The Blueprint is Maryland's surest path to creating beyond great schools,\" said Phelton Moss, a school board candidate from Prince George's County.\nBut to hear other Maryland school board candidates tell it, the Blueprint is a budget-buster.\n\"The Blueprint sounds great on paper; however, funding it is a great challenge for every county in Maryland,\" St. Mary's County school board candidate Elena Brewer said.\nThat debate echoes across Maryland as voters in 20 of the state's 24 school districts prepare to go to the polls. The Local News Network at the University of Maryland sent a questionnaire to all 109 candidates, asking them, among other things, to name the state's top education issue.\nForty-two of the candidates who responded to the questionnaire expressed concerns about the costs and the mandates stemming from the Blueprint. In a school board election where there are no races in Baltimore City or County, a Prince George's County candidate, Zakyia Goins-McCants, summed up the views of a number of candidates from suburban and rural districts.\n\"The Blueprint for Maryland's Future is transformative legislation that reflects our state's commitment to equitable education,\" she said. \"However, it was passed without a full funding plan, and the financial implications are significant.\"\n'A transformational investment'Passed by the General Assembly in 2021 over the veto of then-Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, the Blueprint is built on five pillars. Under the Blueprint, school districts are mandated to:\nCombat the teacher shortage by increasing the minimum teacher salary to $60,000 by July 2026 and build new \"career ladders\" for educators.Expand pre-kindergarten so that it's available free to low- and moderate-income families and available to all.Adjust the curriculum to ensure students are college- and career-ready by the end of 10th grade.Implement a \"ninth-grade tracker\" system to assess how the Blueprint is working for each student as part of a statewide accountability plan.Boost funding to match the state's lofty new goals.\nHearing all of that, many of the state's school board candidates said the Blueprint is a great but complex and pricey plan.\nTierney Davis, a board candidate from Cecil County, called the Blueprint \"a transformational idea\" but noted there are serious issues in implementing the plan. Veronica Lowe from Frederick County called it \"a transformative investment in our education system\" but expressed concerns about funding the effort.\nMichael Shisler from Calvert County said the plan is a chance to \"improve our common good.\"\n\"If we continue to see education as a cost, rather than as an investment, then folks will just wait for this latest reform to fade away,\" Shisler said. \"The Blueprint is an opportunity to level the playing field for all kids in Maryland.\"\nSeveral candidates said that the playing field needs leveling.\n\"The most important issue facing Anne Arundel County Public Schools is the existence of persistent gaps in opportunity and achievement between different subgroups of students,\" said Joanna Bache Tobin of Anne Arundel County.\nMeanwhile, Julie Kaplan of Howard County said schools must improve to make sure every student leaves school prepared for college or a career.\n\"We must address the learning gaps created by the COVID-19 pandemic,\" she said.\nA number of candidates cited stagnant or declining test scores in their school districts and beyond.\n\"Statewide, our student proficiency rates in math and English are suffering,\" said Laura McKenzie of Kent County.\nBut schools will improve if the Blueprint is implemented properly, its supporters said.\n\"The Blueprint offers us an opportunity to invest in our schools and ensure an excellent education for every student,\" said Meg Ricks, a candidate for the school board in Howard County.\n'Unfunded'Support for the Blueprint was by no means uniform among the state's school board candidates, however. Many echoed the thoughts of Andre Gao, another Howard County school board candidate.\n\"The Blueprint for Maryland's Future sounds promising on paper with its goals, but the funding presents a significant problem,\" Gao said. \"Without adequate financial support, implementing the Blueprint will be challenging.\"\nThe Blueprint lacks financial support at both the state and the district level.\nThe General Assembly approved the Blueprint without determining how it would be paid for, and as a result, the state is projected to run long-term deficits that largely track its increased education costs. A state Department of Legislative Services fiscal briefing released in January said that the deficit will appear in fiscal 2025 and hit nearly $2.93 billion in fiscal 2029 \u2014 a year when the Blueprint is set to cost the state $4 billion.\nRachel Hise, the executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board, said she is hopeful the Maryland General Assembly will fully fund the Blueprint and is willing to make changes if necessary.\nWhen asked whether state taxes will be raised to support the Blueprint, Hise said, \"That is a decision for the governor and General Assembly.\"\nAgainst that backdrop, Gov. Wes Moore \u2014 a longtime proponent of the Blueprint \u2014 has acknowledged that the plan may have to be altered.\n\"While I believe in making sure that we have a world-class education system, we've got to be able to work together to create an actual plan to be able to implement it because right now there are real challenges in being able to get that done and get it done in a way that the locals, and the state and every other partner who's involved sees that taking place,\" Moore told Fox45 News in Baltimore in July. \"So, there have to be adjustments.\"\nMeanwhile, school district candidates said the Blueprint is already putting pressure on local school budgets, given that school costs in Maryland are shared by the state and its 24 districts.\n\"While the Blueprint was touted as significantly increasing education funding, the reality is that the funding is not distributed equitably, and rural counties have been left out, by and large,\" said Cathy Allen, a school board candidate in St. Mary's County. \"We did not receive increased funding from the state to cover mandates within the Blueprint.\"\n'So many requirements'School board candidates said they worry not only about the Blueprint's costs, but also about the expensive edicts the plan imposes on local school districts. In some cases, they said, those mandates are already leading to unintended consequences.\nJon M. Andes, a candidate in Worcester County, said he fully supports the Blueprint's five pillars.\n\"However, without additional state funding, we will not be able to implement the Blueprint plan without making significant budget cuts to reallocate funds,\" Andes said. \"As an example, to reach the $60,000 minimum (teacher) salary, we will need to significantly increase class size and reduce materials of instruction.\"\nSuch things are already happening in Howard County, Gao said.\n\"In our school district, we have not received sufficient funding from the state and county to fully implement the Blueprint,\" he said. \"This has contributed to budget shortfalls, leading to staff cuts, program reductions and increased class sizes. Many teachers have already expressed concerns about the negative impact of staff shortages and increased class sizes.\"\nSuch issues stem from the fact that the Blueprint mandates that funding be redirected in a number of ways. For one thing, by mandating higher teacher salaries and a host of other changes, some school districts may be forced to cut other popular programs.\n\"The Blueprint for Maryland's Future mandates so many requirements that it's difficult for our local school system to continue programs it feels are successful,\" said Kerry Gunshenan, a school board candidate in Talbot County.\nIn addition, the Blueprint mandates that districts direct more funding to schools with larger numbers of high-need students, such as those that are performing poorly or where students are learning to speak English.\nMike Lukas, a board member who is running for re-election in Charles County, praised that change.\n\"Your ZIP code or household income should not define the quality of your education,\" he said.\nTom Woods, who is running for re-election to the board in Garrett County, neatly summed up the thoughts of many of the school board members across the state.\n\"The ideas and solutions presented by the Blueprint come with an awful lot of obstacles,\" Woods said.\nLocal News Network director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Each section provides simple lessons on key concepts such as voice projection, body language, and audience engagement, all while allowing children to express their creativity through art.\n\"Confidence in Every Word: Activity Book for Young Speakers\" \u2014 In this activity book, Montgomery incorporates engaging puzzles, games, and scenarios that encourage kids to practice their speaking skills. Activities range from creating short speeches to role-playing different speaking situations, empowering children to build confidence and develop effective communication strategies.\n\"The Little Speaker's Toolkit: Coloring and Crafting Your Speech\" \u2014 This book combines creative expression with practical speech preparation. Children are guided through the process of developing their own speeches, with templates for brainstorming ideas and spaces to illustrate their thoughts. By emphasizing storytelling and personal experiences, kids understand the importance of connecting with their audience.\nMontgomery's books, which reflects her commitment to inclusivity and representation, feature diverse characters and relatable scenarios, allowing children from various backgrounds to see themselves in the material. This approach not only fosters engagement, but also helps to build a sense of belonging and confidence in young readers.\nPublic speaking is a vital skill that lays the foundation for effective communication, critical thinking, and self-confidence. Montgomery's series highlights the significance of these skills from a young age, equipping children with the tools they need to articulate their thoughts, advocate for themselves, and participate actively in discussions. By making public speaking approachable and fun, she encourages children to embrace their voices.\nMontgomery's series of coloring and activity books on public speaking is a remarkable contribution to children's literature and education. Through her engaging and creative approach, she is nurturing a new generation of confident communicators who are ready to express their unique perspectives.\nBy inspiring kids to find their voices and share their stories, Montgomery is not only shaping their futures but also empowering them to shine in all areas of their lives. Her work is a testament to the to the transformative power of education and the importance of fostering communication skills in every child.\nFor more information, go to www.speakezforkids.com. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Parties should stay out of school elections\n\n October 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: David Reel | Section: Columns \n \n 767\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The official voter guide and sample ballot of the Talbot County Board of Elections for Talbot County voters includes the following introduction on upcoming Board of Education elections:Non-Partisan Contest\nCandidates in this contest may or may not be affiliated with any political party.\nThis election cycle, at least four Maryland political party organizations will be involved in local Board of Education elections at significantly different levels.\nOne is the Maryland Democratic Party. Recently Maryland Matters reported \"The Maryland Democratic Party will spend 'tens of thousands of dollars' targeting at least eighteen school board candidates that they maintain are looking to bring a 'hateful' and 'right-wing agenda' to schools.\" The article noted the Maryland Democratic Party has never before been involved in nonpartisan races for local boards of education.\nThe article also noted the Maryland Democratic Party plan includes hiring workers to canvass, knock on doors and urge voters not to elect 26 school board candidates whom the Maryland Democratic Party says support rewriting history, discriminating against kids and book bans. The Maryland Democratic Party will also provide resources to local Democratic central committees for helping candidates who support \"Democratic and inclusive values.\"\nNowhere currently on the Maryland Democratic Party website is a definition of \"Democratic values,\" nor a mention of supporting candidates who back efforts to improve student achievement scores and ensure safe classroom learning environments.\nMaryland Democratic Party leaders say this unprecedented initiative is needed to fight \"extremist\" agendas favored by certain candidates in 11 Maryland counties \u2014 Anne Arundel, Calvert, Carroll, Frederick, Howard, Montgomery, St. Mary's and Talbot. The party also plans to warn against eight other candidates in Allegany, Cecil and Washington counties.\nIn Anne Arundel County, the Maryland Democratic Party has identified three candidates as \"extreme\" candidates who not only support book bans but are also against those in the LGBTQ community. In a post on \"X,\" the Maryland Democratic Party has referred to the three candidates as the \"Anne Arundel Hate Slate.\"\nThe Maryland Democratic Party is not the first or only political organization to target candidates in school board elections. At least three Republican County Central Committees have either done it or are doing it, albeit on a much smaller scale than the Maryland Democratic Party.\nIn this election cycle, the Talbot County Republican Central Committee has paid for a vote early for the school board mailer promoting a school board candidate candidate. The Cecil County Republican Committee endorsed three school Republican board candidates in 2022. The Calvert County Republican Central Committee endorsed Republican school board candidates in at least two election cycles \u2014 2022 and 2024.\nGoing forward, it is impossible to predict if, how or how much, state, and local political party organizations may be involved in local board of education elections and what their campaign messages may be.\nSome may suggest state and local political party organizations have a right to endorse and support local school board candidates.\nThey do have that right. The larger question is if they will exercise that right in the correct way.\nThe correct way is embracing the principle of civil discourse even with those who hold widely differing opinions. In other words \u2014 agree to disagree without being disagreeable.\nIncorrect ways include referring to certain school board candidates as the \"Anne Arundel Hate Slate\" and targeting at least 18 school board candidates who are characterized as looking to bring a \"hateful\" and \"right-wing agenda\" to school boards.\nOur society is already dealing with deeply held and seemingly irreconcilable differences on a wide range of public policy issues based largely on vitriolic and divisive messaging from political party organizations. Their continued involvement in local school board elections is almost guaranteed to generate even more divisiveness.\nVoter access to information to make informed voting decisions is not an issue.\nVoters already have numerous opportunities to research and evaluate every school board candidate's background, experience and views on what they consider to be the most critical issues of the day, as well as their positions, or lack of positions, on those issues.\nThese opportunities include but are not limited to information posted on candidate websites, candidate campaign literature, candidate meet and greets and candidate forums where all candidates are invited to speak and answer questions from attendees. Voters can use all these opportunities to draw their own conclusions on which candidates have views on education matters that resonate best with their views.\nVoters do not need any political organizations to make those conclusions for them. Let the voters and the voters alone decide.\nAccordingly, with regard to all future local school board elections, no state and no local political party organizations need to be or should be involved in any way in those elections. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But decisions with direct impacts on our lives are made at the town and county level, and these elections deserve our thoughtful consideration. The upcoming Talbot County school board election is a prime example.I live in District 2, whose northern edge extends to Port Street, includes the southern part of Easton's historic district, neighborhoods around Idlewild Park and Easton High, much of the east side of Route 50, including Mulberry Station and south to Dutchman's Lane. The choice for us is between Candace Henry and Ann O'Connor.\nInitially undecided, I tuned into the candidate forum. It was clear that both candidates are well-liked in the community, but it was also clear that Ms. Henry is vastly more knowledgeable about the state of our schools and the actions the school board is taking to improve them. Quite simply, she is the more qualified candidate.\nFor example, when Ms. O'Connor suggested asking departing teachers their reason for leaving, Ms. Henry pointed out that exit interviews are conducted and used to improve teacher retention. This pattern repeated itself several times, with Ms. Henry having specific answers where Ms. O'Connor did not. Ms. Henry also shared that teachers are already involved in curriculum development, something Ms. O'Connor suggested as a new idea.\nBut the flyers have made the decision crystal clear. You know what I'm talking about. Our mailboxes have been inundated with them. All contain cherry-picked data about test scores and spending with zero context. Lately these flyers have taken a turn toward incredible as they discuss \"required reading\" in third grade. Incredible meaning not credible.\nThe information in these mailers is designed to shock the recipient and the secretive nature of their funding raises red flags. A brief online search about the sponsor \"Pay Attention America\" leads only to a short-term office space in Wilmington, Delaware. Then last week a Republican friend showed me a flyer she had just received, authorized and paid for by the 1776 Project, a radical far-right group. They were endorsing Ms. O'Connor by name (as well as Karla Wieland-Cherry and Kerry Gunshenan, candidates for school board in Districts 5 and 6, respectively).\nI'm voting for Candace Henry. We need experience and transparency on the school board, not hidden agendas.\nALISON SANFORD\nEaston \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This campaign unfairly targets our schools, students, and dedicated Talbot County Public Schools educators.\nOur team does face challenges like many school districts, and we face them directly and with transparency. While we do not want to give life to these messages you are receiving, we want to make sure our community knows the truth.\nWe are working to improve our performance on state assessments. With support from the Talbot County Council, we have made significant investments, including acquiring new rigorous standards-based curricula and hiring and retaining qualified teachers and administrators. Additionally, we have made math one of our priorities and are putting concentrated efforts into the teaching and learning of this curricular area. We also know that student success is measured by many indicators in addition to state assessment scores.\nWhile we know we have work to do, there is growth we can celebrate. The 23-24 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment results showed modest improvement across all Maryland districts. In Talbot County, our overall margin of progress was slightly greater than what the state achieved. In English/Language Arts, out of the 24 school districts, Talbot County Public Schools had the greatest increase in students being proficient. These results inform our continued work on the initiatives put in place to provide our educators with the resources needed to ensure student success.\nWe adhere to the Health Education Standards set forth by the Maryland Department of Education. Maryland state law requires that parents/guardians be notified about topics covered in the Family Life unit. They have the option of having their student excused if they are uncomfortable with this content being taught to their students by TCPS educators.\nOur Talbot County students graduate from our high schools and continue to excel in college, career and life. This is a result of their hard work, the commitment of the TCPS team, the leadership of the Board of Education and the support of the County Council and our many community partners.\nOur support staff, teachers and administrators are dedicated professionals who deserve our trust and support. By collaborating openly and constructively, we can ensure that our school system remains a beacon of opportunity and excellence for every child, regardless of their background.\nWe invite the community to our established public forums scheduled each month through our regular Board of Education meetings. These meetings are open to all citizens, and we encourage everyone to attend and participate in these sessions. Only through collaboration and communication do we truly provide the best opportunities for our students.\nWe are honored to serve as Talbot County's superintendent of schools and president of the Board of Education, and we are very proud of our students and staff. We believe in and will continue to advocate for TCPS students, families and educators. We are TCPS, and we are committed to transforming and performing together.\nIf you have questions or concerns, please email us at info@talbotschools.org. We are here for you and all of the children of Talbot County. Thank you for your continued support.\nSharon Pepukayi is the superintendent of Talbot County Public Schools. Emily Jackson is president of the Talbot County Board of Education. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

MICHAELS \u2014 The holiday season has come early at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, and boys and girls of a variety of ages are working diligently to craft wooden Christmas trees, stockings, snowmen and marine life to sell as ornaments.As schools across the nation are closing vocational skill programs, the museum's Rising Tide After-School program is filling the gap by providing middle school students the opportunity to learn marketing and vocational skills under the supervision of dedicated volunteers.\nThis program lasts seven weeks and caters to students in grades six through nine. The students learn project design and development, team collaboration tool management and workshop safety.\nAlyssa Zajan, the student and public programs manager, said the students choose the projects they work on for the duration of the program.\n\"This year, they got in the holiday spirit, so they've been making ornaments,\" Zajan said. \"They've been hand cutting them, using hand saws, as well as some of our saws and our power saws, and decorating them. And they're going to market them to the community.\"\nThe ornaments will be included in the museum's store. Students will be choosing price points and learning marketing skills.\nAll proceeds for the ornaments will go back into the program to help it continue.\nAccording to Jill Ferris, Rising Tide's vice president of education and interpretation, the program began in 2017 as a boat building program and has evolved to better serve the core mission of providing middle school students in Talbot County a fun and safe environment where they can access skills education.\nFerris said schools in the area have not been in the position to provide the vocation training they had in the past. The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum sought to provide that kind of experience for students to be able to work with mentors and educators and learn different skills.\n\"How do we connect students and help them develop skills to be the future leaders and pursue pathways that they are interested in, and so the idea of taking an entrepreneurial pathway was one that we just thought was really fun and would be really resonant for the kids,\" Ferris said.\nThe program runs on a quarterly basis, with the next session opening in January 2025. Ferris said accessibility is a core value of the program, and participants are offered partial to full scholarships as well as transportation for students who live outside of St. Michaels.\nHarper Black, a student in the program, said she has enjoyed being in the program and is happy with the work she has been able to accomplish.\n\"It's really cool to work with things you haven't experienced yet,\" Black said. \"Because you don't have the materials at home. So it's cool to come here and do it.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "School mailing accusations are false\n\n November 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 391\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Talbot county residents have recently been receiving U.S. Postal Service mailings questioning the quality of teaching in our county's public schools. Among its many criticisms, the glossy mailings falsely decry the low English and math proficiency and attribute these low scores to time wasted \"forcing harmful gender ideology\" on students.Here are some facts: 39% of students in Talbot County are classified as \"economically disadvantaged\" (data gathered by US News and World Report), and 40% are members of a minority. Fully 14% of students study English as a second language. Talbot County Public Schools is one of only eight districts out of the 24 in Maryland that earned star ratings of three or higher for all schools. (reportcard.msde.maryland.gov)\nIn 2023 Talbot County Schools boasted an attendance rate of 91.5% and a high school graduation rate of 95%. Schools also showed year over year improvement in academic achievement. These are numbers to be proud of, not scorned.\nSo where are these accusations and false claims coming from? They are originating from a group identifying itself as \"Pay Attention America Inc.\" with a postal address listed as 1000 N. West St, Suite 1200, Wilmington, Delaware. In its mailings, it cites the \"Daily Citizen\" whose director of communications claims: \"God has declared certain things 'good' and certain things 'bad.' He's given us clear principles to use in considering current events. And He's spoken clearly on the subjects of life, marriage, law and government. We cannot remain morally neutral in our reporting.\"\nAre we all to believe that God has spoken directly to the Daily Citizen and told it what is good and what is bad and facts are irrelevant? The mailings scream \"radical politicians are pushing extreme radical agendas\" and \"radical indoctrination\" of children is taking place in the schools.\nUnfortunately, our public schools make an easy target for out of state organizations with a defined political agenda. It is sad that their misrepresentations and slurs seek to divide our community instead of seeking solutions in a positive, fact-based approach. We believe it is important, more now than ever, to make decisions based on facts, not gobbledygook.\nUltimately, we question why a Delaware religious organization finds it necessary to alarm us when all Talbot citizens have to do is simply talk to our teachers and our school administrators about our concerns.\nThat is how local control works.\nJIM WILKINS\nMARTHA HAMLYN\nJIM RICHARDSON\nClaiborne \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ms. Henry has an in-depth knowledge of the Talbot County community and all of its diversity, as well as an informed understanding of state level issues and initiatives.\nShe has actually read the Maryland Blueprint for Education and has the ability to conceptualize the strengths and challenges of its implementation. She uses data to develop a solid plan for ensuring that resources and supports are targeted to students who need them most, that all students have access to challenging academics and that all voices are heard and understood.\nI urge District 2 voters to choose their candidate wisely. Like her opponent, Candace Henry is also a compassionate parent and well respected member of the community, but is without a doubt the standout choice based on her experience, knowledge and resounding endorsement from the TCEA.\nEMILY MOODY\nEaston \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I urge you to learn about your school board candidates and what they stand for.I'm not a mother, but I feel strongly about voting for the best candidate for my school board district (District 2). That candidate is Candace Henry.\nAs the product of public schools from Grades 5-12 myself, I want someone on the board who is interested in creating a diverse, inviting and equitable atmosphere for all children in every classroom.\nAs a librarian by training, I feel strongly about access to information and books for all. Parents who want to have a say in their children's reading material should have that, but that desire should not interfere with anyone else's access to information. The transparency and opportunity already exist for those who want to examine and/or opt out of certain materials.\nAs a county resident, I am invested in the futures of its students. The best future for them, and for the rest of us, is for students to have equal access to high-quality educational materials and opportunities for success. As our future citizens and leaders, they should be learning empathy.\nCandace Henry is the incumbent District 2 candidate. She brings decades of experience in education to the board. As a TCPS graduate and mother of current county public school students, she is dedicated to the success of the school system and every student therein.\nWhile the race for school board is non-partisan, the opposition candidate is backed by Moms for Liberty. This group focuses on policing access to materials that promote diversity, minorities and marginalized groups. They seek to remove protections for LGBTQ+ students when they are at their most vulnerable. They seek to divide, restrict and exclude.\nCandace Henry is running on a platform of excellence, equity and inclusivity for all students in Talbot County. If you are in District 2, please vote to reelect Candace Henry to the school board. Anna Howie and Cynthia Jurrius are the other two candidates to support in their respective districts. They are also running against Moms for Liberty-supported candidates.\nYour vote matters. Please be ready to make selections for every position up for a vote on the ballot. Be sure to vote for the candidate who best represents your values.\nMISSY CORLEY\nEaston \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

These results inform our continued work on the initiatives put in place to provide our educators with the resources needed to ensure student success.\nWe adhere to the health education standards set forth by the Maryland Department of Education. Maryland state law requires that parents/guardians be notified about topics covered in the family life unit. They have the option of having their student excused if they are uncomfortable with this content being taught to their students by Talbot County Public Schools educators.\nOur Talbot County students graduate from our high schools and continue to excel in college, career and life. This is a result of their hard work, the commitment of the TCPS team, the leadership of the Board of Education and the support of the County Council and our many community partners.\nOur support staff, teachers and administrators are dedicated professionals who deserve our trust and support. By collaborating openly and constructively, we can ensure that our school system remains a beacon of opportunity and excellence for every child, regardless of their background.\nWe invite the community to our established public forums scheduled each month through our regular Board of Education meetings. These meetings are open to all citizens, and we encourage everyone to attend and participate in these sessions. Only through collaboration and communication do we truly provide the best opportunities for our students.\nWe are honored to serve as Talbot County's superintendent of schools, and president of the Board of Education, and we are very proud of our students and staff. We believe in and will continue to advocate for Talbot County Public Schools students, families and our highly driven team of educators. We are TCPS, and we are committed to transforming and performing together.\nIf you have questions or concerns, please email us at info@talbotschools.org. We are here for you and all of the children of Talbot County. Thank you for your continued support. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Student vets' stories provide unique insight on service\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Kesha Williams Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 810\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Administrators and students at Elizabeth City's three institutions of higher education gathered at College of The Albemarle on Thursday for a unique Veterans Day observance.During the event, veterans enrolled at COA, Mid-Atlantic Christian University, and Elizabeth City State University talked about their military experiences and how their decision to serve their country had affected their lives and career choices.\nBobby Martin, a student at MACU, joined the U.S. Navy after high school in 1977. His dad, a Vietnam era veteran and minister, was his role model, he said. When his dad's colleagues visited their home to enjoy meals and football games, Martin said he heard first-hand accounts about what it meant to serve in the military.\n\"These men were inspirations to me,\" Martin said. \"I have been to the North Pole, Europe, Middle East and East Africa while in the Navy. I'm 66 years old, put my wife and child through school, and now I'm working on my ministry degree at Mid-Atlantic Christian University. \"\nWendra Costly, a U.S. Army veteran now enrolled at COA, recalled how she left the U.S. Army in 2018 wondering what she would do. While her job in the military was in information technology, and there are promising job opportunities in that field, Costly wasn't persuaded IT would provide her with the long-term career she was seeking.\nAnd as a wife and mother of four, Costly said she knew it was important to have a rewarding career with good pay.\n\"I called the aviation department (at COA) and got some information about their program. I finally decided that aviation was the way to go for (me in) our area,\" she said.\nCostly also talked about some of the challenges veterans face when they go back to school.\n\"We are older, and we have had some experiences that a good amount of college adults will not be able to relate to,\" she said.\nBut overcoming challenges is something you learn to do in the military, Costly said.\n\"Just like all the hard things you accomplished in the military like training, running in the rain, heat and cold \u2014 we can do them,\" she said.\nMichelle Barnes, who is enrolled at ECSU, spent eight years working as an aviation electronics technician in the U.S. Navy. Barnes said the fear of traveling to unfamiliar places and the potential of having to face danger nearly delayed her decision to enlist.\nBut she's glad she did enlist. Barnes said her job in the Navy was challenging and provided steady pay.\nToday, she's glad she accepted the challenges the military offered. She met her husband, who is currently enlisted, while she was in service. Serving in the military also has helped her pay for her college expenses.\n\"Joining the military was the best decision that I could have ever made at the age of 25,\" Barnes said. \"I decided to embrace all that the Navy had to offer me in honor of those who fought and died for this country's freedom. \"\nBarnes said she will graduate in 2026 with a bachelor of science degree in aviation science with a concentration in professional aeronautics and a minor in unmanned aerial systems.\nDr. Catherine Edmonds, ECSU's interim chancellor, applauded her colleagues at MACU and COA for helping area veterans return to school to learn new skills. She also thanked the veterans who attended the event.\n\"Although we work every day to assist and honor our veterans, today is set aside specifically to recognize all of our veterans for their service and sacrifices,\" she said. \"We are a military-friendly university, proud to continue a tradition of excellence serving military members, veterans, and their families.\"\nBane Angles, vice president of student services at MACU and also a veteran, said he was impressed by the student veterans' stories. He also was glad, he said, that the city's three institutions of higher education could come together and offer an event like Thursday's.\n\"There are many important lessons I learned from serving in the military,\" Angles said. \"Not least of these is the importance of unity. No matter where a person is from, what accent they have, what race they are, or creed they follow, all are part of something bigger.\n\"In a society that is too divided for many reasons, we can learn from our armed forces that a higher purpose brings us together in unity. I pray for the day when our country is not divided but is united,\" Angles said.\nCOA President Dr. Jack Bagwell said the community college was proud to host Thursday's event. He also applauded the veterans in the audience for their service and urged them to help the college serve them better.\n\"We believe we can get better everyday,\" he said. \"With you helping us there are things we have not thought of yet that will serve you better. Please share those. We are always open to your feedback. We're certainly open to how we can be more military friendly.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Athens High School holds Veterans Day event for students\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Gabriel Scotto APG Media | Section: News \n \n 570\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ATHENS - Ahead of Monday's Veterans Day celebrations, Athens High School held a special assembly for its students to talk and hear from veterans throughout Athens County.According to a study conducted by the United States Census Bureau in 2022, 6.2% of the adult population are veterans. However, this number has fallen significantly. In 2005, there were 23.4 million veterans. By 2022, there were only 16.2 million, with nearly half of those being 65 or older. There are only 795,600 veterans who served in the Second World War or the Korean War.\nIt is for these reasons that Melissa Myers, student council advisor and a French teacher at Athens High School, says this event is important. Myers recounted when she volunteered at an assisted living home while in high school and formed a bond with a Belgian woman who'd lived through the World Wars and how it changed her perspective.\n\"You can study history and read books and watch movies, but you never truly get an understanding of what people have gone through,\" Myers said. \"It's (about) making those stories come to life and having a better appreciation.\"\nMyers' perspective is also shaped by her father, who served in the Army National Guard, as well as her time serving in the Peace Corps. She hopes talking to veterans will help high school students gain a similar perspective on the importance of service and on fighting for a cause that's greater than oneself.\n\"Hopefully for our high school students it helps our young people understand, no matter what your positions are on various things, everyone who serves, they're serving their country. It's one single vision.\"\nThe main event at the Veterans Day assembly was a speech from Chad Springer, associate superintendent at Athens City Schools and a former United States Army sergeant. Springer felt it was important to share his experience with the students of Athens High School, even if he personally prefers to celebrate Veterans Day quietly.\n\"Some veterans like to go to the public events and things like that,\" Springer said. \"Generally, I don't, because service is very personal to me, because all of us had our own reasons for serving.\"\nSpringer told the story of his uncles, Bob and Howard. Howard was a United States Army Ranger during the Second World War, while Bob served in the Army during the Korean War. Bob was able to rise to the rank of sergeant first class in three years, an impressive feat that would've taken years to achieve during peacetime, but he carried the scars of Korea with him for the rest of his life.\n\"Most of the family saw him as a larger than life man with a short fuse, a quick temper and a love of the drink,\" Springer explained.\nSpringer said that serving in the military and experiencing the challenges of military service gave him a different perspective on his Uncle Bob than the rest of his family had and that had he not served, he would've remembered his uncles very differently.\n\"I learned to not judge lest ye be judged, because when it came down to it, we were all needed by other. I became a brother to those around me,\" Springer said, recounting his time in the Army. \"When someone needed me, their needs were met. When I needed something, others were always there for me. It instilled in myself a sense of community and belonging that I have never felt before nor since.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gotto Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 888\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Chestertown \u2014 A colorful, repurposed school travels about Kent County, stopping at various elementary schools to deliver not only their wonderfully imaginative series of children's novels, but some good, old-fashioned face time with the books' authors, Robbi Behr and Matthew Swanson of Chestertown.For several years now the entrepreneurial illustrator and writer pair have been quietly supporting the effort to provide better access to books for kids in Title I schools. With every school they visit, they have been winning kids over with a lively presentation that allows the children to imagine what it's like to be creators themselves.\nThis agency-invoking exercise would prove to be the catalyst that convinced the married couple to embark on their cross-county, \"Busload of Books Tour.\" The intent to visit one Title I school in every state over the course of a year was the direct result of the enthusiasm that kids and educators alike found in the approachable, friendly and totally immersive experience that Behr and Swanson provided.\nA team of educational researchers from Washington College was also assembled to compile the data necessary to ascertain relevant outcomes and impacts that will be used to assess and support the needs of Title I schools going forward.\nThe trip was chronicled daily by the pair via social media and by others who had the opportunity to see this presentation for themselves. And even though it is more than a year since they all got off the bus, narratives about this remarkable trip and its impacts on the communities of kids visited continues to make news on both the local and national level, with an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show and articles in both Forbes and People magazines, among many others.\nThroughout the 2024-2025 school year, the couple has continued their literacy initiative by planning to visit a total of 12 schools across the country; six in-person and six virtually.\nBehr and Swanson, who have a significant portion of their career portfolio anchored in the art of collaboration, have been regular speakers on the topic over the last decade, honing a particular blend of authentic communication skills and humor that resonate with their audiences. As a result, they have been recognized and supported by peers within their creative, collaborative sphere of influence, which has led to other opportunities to share what they know.\nEarlier in 2024, Swanson said, they received an interesting email from one such peer who felt they would be a thought-provoking addition to a roster of speakers at this year's Masters of Scale Conference held in San Francisco and sponsored by the podcast of the same name and its parent company, WaitWhat media properties.\nThe email, which was authored by company CEO, Jeff Berman, was a pitch for the couple to join a distinguished list of thought-leaders in their respective fields who would speak to the conference's theme which leans heavily in all things tech, with a focus this year on the advent of Artificial Intelligence, or AI.\n\"First of all, I was like, why do they want us to talk at this thing?\" Swanson said. \"From what we understood, it's like a tech conference and we are kind of like the most analog people with what we're doing. We're driving around in a bus giving out boxes of books.\"\nTo date, this would be the largest and most widely recognized conference at which the pair would speak, with notables such as American internet entrepreneur and venture capitalist, Reid Hoffman, the CEO of Chewy, Inc., Sumit Singh, former President Bill Clinton, and Wes Moore, Governor of Maryland, scheduled to present.\n\"However, it totally made sense from the standpoint that Robbi and I have never fit in wherever we've gone,\" added Swanson. \"Our first big speaking gig was the International Illustrators Conference, when we had not published a single book. We were there because of our story being an inspiring sort of tale of entrepreneurship and outside-of-the-box thinking. And to that extent, being invited to Masters of Scale was the same thing. We had done something unexpected that people found inspiring and interesting and that they thought might serve as a model to others about how to look beyond the expected solutions.\"\nSo how would they take a presentation geared to elementary school kids and age it up for an adult audience?\n\"Really there's about 30 different stories, single stories you could tell, right? Behr conjectured. \"There's the story of the research, there's the story of the kids, there's the story of the teachers, there's stories of communities, there's the story of us driving around.\"\nThe result was an interactive, yet intimate chat with an audience of about 800 people that spoke to the genesis of their outreach, the challenges that Title I schools continue to face, family life on the road in that colorful bus, and the incredible partnerships forged from the very beginning.\nBy the time the winding tale of an adorable hippo named Jenny whose dream to own an ice cream shop was realized and then threatened by the evil, lactose-intolerant sun, there wasn't a dry eye in the house, as the audience whole-heartedly leaned into their exercise\u2014their attention definitely captured.\nBehr and Swanson summarized their talk by relaying that in a sense, we all have the option to create a \"colorful school bus\" of sorts and drive it down a path of our choosing that represents a change for the better. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland conservatives make gains in school board races\n\n November 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Adam Hudacek Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1263\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Conservative school board candidates saw sweeping wins across Maryland this week, defying expectations in the largely blue state and solidifying the influence of the 1776 Project PAC, the Republican-aligned organization that endorsed 19 candidates statewide.In total, 11 of the political action committee's endorsed candidates either won or narrowly led their races as of Friday morning. Candidates backed by the PAC won control of the school boards in Somerset and Calvert counties, while appearing poised to win in Talbot County. Final results await the counting of some mail-in and provisional ballots, which must be counted by Nov. 15.\nCampaign finance records show that the Maryland State Education Association Fund for Children and Public Education \u2014 the political arm of the state's teachers union \u2014 spent $516,999.57 during the 2024 election cycle. And the 1776 Project PAC clearly sees the teachers' union as its defeated rival in the election.\n\"Even outspending us by $450,000, the teachers' union couldn't beat us in deep-blue Maryland\u2014their message is just too extreme,\" said Stefano Forte, executive director of the 1776 Project PAC. \"Voters chose raising test scores and graduation rates over their far-left culture war. On Tuesday, common sense won, and that has no price tag.\"\nA fourth school district with candidates targeted for defeat by Democrats \u2014 Washington County \u2014 also flipped to conservative control without the aid of the 1776 Project PAC.\nOf those 11 winners endorsed by that conservative PAC, six had also been targeted for defeat by the Maryland Democratic Party, which selected 24 \"extreme\" conservative school board candidates in the state to directly invest against \u2014 a move the party referred to as \"unprecedented.\" Of those 24, only nine have been lost thus far. The remaining 15 all won or are leading their respective races.\n\"We are proud that we pushed out some of the most extreme elements in these races,\" said Luca Amayo, spokesperson for the Maryland Democratic Party. \"It's clear, however, that we must continue to bolster our grassroots efforts and make Marylanders aware of the far-right agenda encroaching into Maryland's public schools, especially as they are emboldened under a Donald Trump presidency.\"\nThe party considers the 1776 Project PAC a \"radical ring-wing group,\" and helped defeat five of its endorsed candidates from winning office. Ryan James Girdusky, the committee's founder, wrote on the PAC's website that he created the organization \"to change public education by reforming school boards and electing reform-minded conservatives who wanted to improve public education in this country.\"\nAs of Oct. 16, the PAC had pumped $90,580.50 toward the campaigns of 13 candidates across Cecil, Queen Anne's, Talbot, Calvert, Somerset and St. Mary's counties.\nIn Calvert County, candidates endorsed by the 1776 Project PAC won all three school board seats.\nRetired principal Mike Shisler lost his bid for the board. He said he fears that the new conservative leadership, all of whom were targeted by the state's Democratic Party as well, would create inequity and fear within the county's education system.\n\"I'm very disappointed in the results,\" Shisler said Wednesday, \"It's not going to be inclusive of everybody. It's going to target folks. It's going to try to undo the work of previous boards of education when it came to stressing equity and diversity, and I think they're trying to roll back the clock.\"\nJoseph Marchio, who defeated Shisler, said he expected a close race going into Tuesday night. His margin was the closest of the three 1776 Project PAC-backed victors in Calvert County.\nIn Washington County, on the state's panhandle, all four candidates that Democrats targeted for defeat won their election, flipping the county's school board into conservative control. All three non-targeted incumbents lost reelection, while April Ann Zentmeyer, the only targeted incumbent, defended hers.\n\"I look forward to working with new board members and faithful colleagues to maximize opportunities for students, faculty, staff, and parents; and to identify solutions that will strengthen WCPS,\" Zentmeyer said in a statement.\nWashington County has a county-wide school board election process, as opposed to the school districts where candidates are elected by district. Instead of one-on-one races, all school board candidates in Washington County face each other in a crowded pool, with the top four vote-getting candidates winning seats. Carroll, Allegany and Frederick counties have similar systems.\nThe success of conservative school board candidates around Maryland reflects a larger trend from this year's election cycle: the state's rightward shift. According to data from the Associated Press, every county in Maryland shifted rightward this year compared to the 2020 election \u2014 from two points in Charles County and Baltimore City to eight points in Cecil County.\nSome races remain too close to call. In Frederick County, two conservative candidates targeted by Democrats led the race for three seats as of Friday, but two other candidates trailed close behind. Talbot County, which flipped conservative this cycle, saw two 1776 Project PAC-endorsed candidates win seats, while a third trailed by a narrow margin as of Friday with votes still left to tally.\nSomerset County, the third district flipped by 1776 Project PAC-endorsed contenders, saw massive margins of victory for the conservatives, with Mary Beth Bozman securing about four-fifths of the vote in her race. Her opponent was Alverne \"Chet\" Chesterfield \u2014 who, the Local News Network reported last month, had a peace order initiated against him in 2022.\nThe Local News Network also reported that Brandie Edelen, a 1776 Project PAC-endorsed candidate in St. Mary's County, had a state tax lien filed against her in 2019. Edelen handily lost her race to Josh Guy.\nIn deep-blue Howard County, Andrea Chamblee is in a tight race with Trent Kittleman, an early supporter of the county's Moms for Liberty chapter. Even though Democrat Kamala Harris carried over two-thirds of the votes cast in the presidential race in the county, Chamblee led Kittleman by only 3.5 points as of Friday morning.\nMail-in and provisional ballots, which have leaned in favor of Chamblee this far, are still being counted.\nThe founder of Moms for Liberty in Frederick County, Jaime Brennan, appeared headed to victory. She said that despite the Maryland Democrats' campaign against her and Colt Black, the other conservative in the race, that effort didn't appear to be all that effective.\n\"They spent a lot of money in opposition to me and Colt, and to prop up the other side, but I didn't hear from a single person who said, 'Oh, I heard about this and I'm not voting for you,'\" Brennan said.\nIn neighboring Carroll County, where Moms For Liberty lobbied for the removal of 60 books from school libraries \u2014 21 permanently \u2014 conservative candidates secured their hold on the board. Greg Malveaux and Kristen Zihmer defeated Amanda Jozkowski and Muri Lynn Dueppen, who together ran an underdog progressive campaign called the Slate for Student Success, which was endorsed by the Carroll County Educators Association.\n\"It's really a shame that a lot of voters in our county chose to kind of take their marching orders from their political party, rather than considering the opinions of the educators,\" Jozkowski said. She previously ran and lost in 2022.\nJozkowski said the race was a reflection of the national results, which saw an overwhelming rightward shift in nearly every state and in many down-ballot races. Malveaux and Zihmer were both targeted by the Maryland Democrats.\nThat rightward shift could also be seen in the school board race in Anne Arundel County's District 3. There, the conservative candidate, Chuck Yocum, fell only 2.76 points behind his opponent, Erica McFarland, despite weeks of controversy over Yocum's 1994 acquittal on child sexual abuse and perverted practices charges.\nLocal News Network reporters Sasha Allen, Marwa Barakat, Ela Jalil, Colin McNamara and Tolu Talabi contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS \u2014 The Talbot County Free Library, St. Michaels Branch has opened its temporary location at the St. Michaels Village Shopping Center on Talbot Street. To celebrate the grand opening, the library provided free coffee, craft bags and donuts for all visitors on Tuesday morning.The Talbot Free Library on Fremont Street is currently undergoing construction for its building expansion. The temporary location, at the site of the former St. Michaels YMCA, will serve residents of St. Michaels until the expansion is complete.\nShauna Beulah, branch manager for the library, said construction at the Fremont location will take about a year to 18 months.\n\"A full service library will offer all of the services we had there, a Xerox machine, children's area with all the different kinds of materials they had, and audio books and DVDs, new books, all of those things,\" Beulah said.\nBeulah said the location of the temporary library was important because it needed to be accessible and a familiar space for residents to visit.\nThough it is a full-service library, there are some amenities the temporary location does not provide, including meeting rooms and an external book drop, so books will need to be returned during open hours.\nBut Beulah said the wait would be worth the vast renovation expected at the Fremont location. Renovations include an eating area, social computer rooms, a quiet reading section and a multi-purpose section for all.\nDiana Hastings, youth services librarian, said the first few families who visit the new library will get a fall bag with fun crafts for all ages to encourage creativity and family-based activities.\nHastings, who is also an art therapist, said she tries to provide hands-on crafts and activities to young readers to create and explore and prepare for their journey into literacy.\nThough the temporary library is a smaller space, Hastings said it provides an extensive array of youth books, including bilingual children's book, fiction, non-fiction chapter books, vox books (live print audio books) and recorded storybooks. If a book is not available at the library, librarians can order it from a different library.\nThis way efforts are made for residents to still have access to the information they need.\n\"We hope that families take advantage of coming here, utilizing our resources, and we welcome them,\" Hastings said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Districts 2, 5 and 6 were on the ballot in the November election.\nFor district 2, O'Connor won with 52.7% of the vote, according to the State Board of Elections, beating out incumbent Board Member Candace Henry. O'Connor said her campaign provided the opportunity for her to get a better understanding of leading a campaign, school board responsibilities and Blueprint, Maryland's 10-year plan to improve the state's education system.\nO'Connor said she has just skimmed the surface and is ready to learn more.\nShe said she will be prioritizing academics and discipline. With academics, she said she would like to see elementary students reading every night and working on more book reports, and for schools to provide summer reading lists.\nFor discipline, O'Connor said she has noticed a lack of consistency, or \"different rules for different people.\"\n\"We need a plan for all the schools that this is the way we're going to, you know, this is the dress, this is the behavior when you walk in the building. If you veer from that, there's going to be this consequence, and you got to, I mean, it's the follow through,\" she said.\nFor District 5, Karla Wieland-Cherry won with 54.6% votes, according to the State Board of Elections. Wieland-Cherry, who defeated incumbent Board Member Anna Howie, said she appreciated the support she received from her campaign, though she did mention she \"got a lot of negativity.\" She hopes she can work through any negative sentiments to have a productive four years on the board.\nWieland-Cherry said she will be prioritizing open communication for everyone she works with and promoting the Career and Technology Education Program, which offers job training in various fields.\nShe said it's important to encourage kids to look at career alternatives for those not interested in college, whether that be training to become a firefighter, plumber or welder.\n\"I think (the CTE program is) under encouraged, under utilized,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"And that's where jobs are.\"\nFor District 6, Jurrius won with 51.9% of the vote, defeating Kerry Gunshenan, according to the State Board of Elections. Current District 6 Board Member Mary Wheeler did not seek reelection.\nJurrius did not answer calls from reporters in time for publication. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Student-parents need support from colleges\n\n November 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE MUNOZ | Section: Columns \n \n 711\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After my daughter's mom left when she was an infant, I raised her as a single father while I went to college. As a first-generation student, higher education was my hope for a better future for both of us.Like so many student-parents, I faced numerous obstacles including housing and food insecurity and a lack of affordable child care. I know what it's like when you can't pay for books, food or a place to live. Beyond the scarcity of physical resources, I felt like I didn't fit in.\nIt's not uncommon for student-parents to feel hopeless and isolated on campus. As president of Long Beach City College, it is my personal and professional mission to make sure all students who come to our campus feel a sense of belonging.\nAcross the nation, one in five college students are parents. In addition to attending college, student parents engage with multiple sectors including early childhood education, K-12, the labor market and social safety net programs. Together, we must do more to ensure student parents have the support they need to achieve the aspirations they have for themselves and their families.\nAccording to Long Beach Community College data, the majority of our student-parents are mothers of color who are 25 years of age or older and facing financial disadvantages. The majority of our student-parents also identify as single.\nWhen I look back on my own experience, I remember single mothers telling me I was in a position of privilege because I am a dad. I stood out as a single parent, and they saw that people wanted to help me. While research on student fathers is scarce, one study shows that student fathers are indeed more likely to receive help than student mothers.\nI believe that being a student-parent is challenging no matter how you identify, but single mothers deal with a unique level of stigma.\nWhen I arrived at Long Beach Community College as vice president of student services, I noticed signs with a stroller and a bar through it saying \"No children allowed.\" We got that changed immediately. That wasn't the message we wanted to send. At the college, we want student-parents to know they are appreciated here, and so are their children.\nIn addition to the Child Development Center for children ages 2-5, student-parents can also access cost-free after-school care for children ages 6-18 through the Viking Clubhouse, in partnership with the Boys & Girls Club of Long Beach. We also offer a CalWORKs (California Work Opportunity and Responsibility for Kids) program to assist student parents with education, training and job skills. One of the programs that I'm most excited about involves our partnership with Raise The Barr. Through this partnership, single parent students and their families can access affordable child care and housing.\nWe are making progress, but we have more hard work ahead. Culture change takes time, and we need to continually hold ourselves accountable. A recent survey revealed that more than half of the student-parents on our campus do not know about the resources available to them. We cannot expect student-parents, who are already more likely to face time poverty, to spend hours researching where to find help and navigating disparate processes.\nAs we strive to improve, we're engaging other partners in this important work. We are one of four community colleges selected for Ascend at the Aspen Institute's Postsecondary Leadership Circle Activation Fund. Through our partnership with Ascend, we are driving two key strategies forward.\nThe first involves streamlining resources so that student-parents can more easily access services and programs. Our team is in the process of creating a one-stop shop for housing, food, child care, mental health, academic supports and more. The next strategy involves an outreach campaign to make sure students know about available services.\nBy nurturing our student-parents through degree completion or through the transfer process to a four-year university, we are creating opportunities for one generation to the next. Student-parents model hard work and commitment for their children. Today, my daughter is a community college professor, and I couldn't be prouder.\nBeyond providing the very best for their families, student-parents have much to contribute to their campuses and their communities. When these dedicated caregivers succeed, it is a win for us all, and that's why we must continue to dedicate ourselves to their victory. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland schools get new rules for shooter drills\n\n November 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARISSA YELENIK Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 809\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Active shooter drills in Maryland schools will be different next school year under a new set of state guidelines meant to limit the impact those drills have on the mental health of students.The new guidelines prohibit trauma-inducing elements like imitation of gunfire or explosions. They also require school systems to notify parents in advance when students will be practicing what to do in the event of an active shooter in their buildings.\nThe new guidelines were released by the Maryland Center for School Safety this fall, ordered by a new state law requiring them to draft new parameters and create a new process for collecting and analyzing data on their effectiveness. The center will also look into the psychological impact the shooter drills have on staff, parents and students.\nParts of the guidelines \u2014 including bans on gunfire and the requirement to notify parents \u2014 have already gone into effect because they are part of state law. The full set of guidelines will be put into effect at the beginning of the academic year in 2025.\n\"The mental health crisis that we see in our young people is undeniable,\" said Del. Jared Solomon, who sponsored the measure in the Maryland House of Delegates earlier this year. \"As we normalize having to deal with school shootings, we are creating more anxiety and more issues among young people.\"\nWhile schools have long practiced safety drills, active shooter drills are relatively new, following the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School, according to the guidelines.\nSchool systems have made an effort to keep students safe by implementing active shooter drills, however, concerns have been raised across the country about the impact these drills have on student's mental health. This led to the April passage of the Maryland bill, as well as an executive order signed by President Joe Biden to increase federal guidance on the subject.\nMaryland's new guidelines, released in October, call for unified terminology between districts to discourage miscommunication between the school system and the relevant public. They intend to increase communication between staff and students to create an open dialogue where everyone feels comfortable raising concerns, as well as creating a diverse planning team who will work on planning the drills and doing a post-analysis of how it went and any shortcomings it faced.\nThe guidelines emphasize that active shooter drills are not a one-size-fits-all matter, and should be adjusted to fit the age group.\n\"These are going to be part of a young person's life for the foreseeable future, but that doesn't mean that you can't do them in a way that is both trauma-informed and age-appropriate,\" said Solomon. \"It's really important that the way school systems do these types of events reflects a care and age appropriateness of the grades that are being impacted.\"\nThe guidelines also recommend that a mechanism be established to pause or stop the drill when necessary, for schools to notify parents before and after all drills to increase trust and communication and to allow students and staff who feel uncomfortable to opt-out from the drills.\nThe Maryland General Assembly sponsors of the bill, Solomon and Sen. Cheryl Kagan, felt that the impact guns have on today's children needs to be mitigated as much as possible, and worked to balance a focus on their safety while prioritizing their mental health.\n\"The law that Del. Solomon and I sponsored and passed tried to walk the fine line of thoughtful preparation that isn't traumatic,\" Kagan said. \"And we also had to consider parents and community members who are understandably alarmed and concerned when they see the impact of these drills \u2026 Our concern was that [the drills] were not being strategic in how they were handled, and were actually causing trauma for those involved.\"\nOne active shooter drill that occurred in Solomon's district served as a driving force for his involvement.\n\"Families were literally getting texts from their kids saying 'I don't know if I'll ever see you again' and it was a drill. They didn't know,\" said Solomon. \"There was no requirement prior to this for a school or a school system to notify families before or after.\"\nAdditional drivers for the bill included shared experiences from other parents Solomon spoke to, he said. Many shared frustrations at the lack of foresight they had into when the drills would be taking place and what would happen during them, preventing them from having appropriate conversations with their children to prepare them.\nStarting in January, schools will distribute a new survey made by the National Center for School Mental Health to gather feedback from staff, parents and students on how effective the drills are, and the mental impact they have on all involved.\n\"The goal is not to create fear but to instill confidence and preparedness,\" the Maryland Center for School Safety said in their guidelines. \"By working together as a community, schools can foster safe and supportive learning environments.\" \n\n Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It also raised funds for projects and initiatives in the school district requested by teachers.\nFriday's event raised showcased six specific requests, including a student leadership program, pre-kindergarten language and literacy, and the Easton Middle School band, according to TCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi.\n\"To me, this event is near and dear, recollecting back to my teacher days and having those really nice innovative ideas, but knowing sometimes the funding doesn't stretch,\" Pepukayi said. \"I can resonate with the teachers being able to have these ideas, to write them up, pitch them, and then more importantly be able to talk about them to the people who can help and assist.\"\nHaythe, who is president of the nonprofit organization Foundation of Hope and also serves on the Talbot County Council, graduated from Easton High School in 1991.\nShe said she remembers teachers in elementary, middle and high school who helped her believe in herself.\n\"Hopefully I can encourage other people to believe in themselves that may doubt themselves in high school because there's a lot of people that have it together and they're voted most likely to succeed, and then there's some others that are in high school that may not think that. They may doubt themselves,\" Haythe said in an interview.\nEglseder graduated from St. Michaels High School in 1975. Following medical school, He began working as a physician in Easton in 1986, and has provided internal medicine services to the community for the 38 years since.\nAsparagus Murray attended Robert Russa Moton High School from seventh through 11th grade before moving to Philadelphia. From 1996 to 2022, she worked as a family law magistrate in the Caroline County District Court.\nIn an interview, she said her time at Moton High School and in Easton taught her how to advocate for people, a skill she carried forward to her career in social work. Asparagus Murray said Moton High School \u2014 an all-Black school at the time \u2014 was critical in her formative years.\n\"I think that the camaraderie and the spirit of the school is really unmatched for minority students. It's hard to describe what that was like,\" Asparagus Murray said. \"Even though you may have been considered the step-child of the system, we never saw ourselves as that. And the faculty certainly didn't try to get us to think that that was the case. Their focus was rising above what is expected. I think that's irreplaceable.\"\nShe said Friday's recognition was an honor, adding that it's critical for people to continue supporting public education.\n\"No matter where you go to school or anything, we always have to have a strong public educational system, because that is the vehicle by which most of our citizenry is educated,\" Asparagus Murray said. \" \u2026 Education is the key to unlock the door to opportunity.\" \n\n Copyright 2024",

A dozen Kent Island High School Honor Society student coaches also lend a hand in serving as role models to younger students.\nCrediting Queen Anne's County Public Schools as a fantastic partner, Ray thanked the initiatives' Advisory Board, the county commissioners, and QACPS for collaborative support.\nWith well over 20 years of providing assisting students, the community came together unofficially in 1999 to consider an initiative to support county students in the wake of the Columbine tragedy, before officially forming the character focused resource initiative in the fall of 2000, according to Committee Co-Chair Wayne Humphries.\n\"Its been a very exciting and very quick time,\" Humphries said, and credited phenomenal teams of volunteers and the support of the community to ensure the continuation of the legacy.\nOver the decades it is estimated Character Counts has reached a total of between 70,000 and 100,000 students, he said.\n\"Its hard to believe in a county our size, but in 25 years it adds up,\" Humphries said.\nPresenting an official anniversary proclamation, County Commissioner and former Character Counts Coach Phil Dumenil remembered the organization's 12th anniversary and the graduating students at the time who had been with the program since its inception.\n\"It's obviously a brilliant program,\" Dumenil said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Three new members will be sworn in next month.\n\"Your guidance and direction as board members has strengthened the bond between our community and our schools,\" Pepukayi said.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said the three outgoing members were crucial to the Board of Education's work to improve education in the county.\n\"That (work) is quietly often led by these three, which maybe you aren't aware of in the community. But I'm telling you tonight,\" Jackson said. \"We are going to be cut down at the knees. We will grow back. But we are losing three incredibly important and valuable resources.\"\nWheeler, the outgoing District 6 representative who opted not to run for reelection, served on the board for 7.5 years. Cynthia Jurrius will assume Wheeler's seat after defeating Kerry Gunshenan in this month's election.\nBoard Member Amy Dodson said she will miss Wheeler's \"pragmatism\" and \"common sense.\"\n\"I hope that I've done some good for the kids in Talbot County Public Schools. If I didn't, I know I tried,\" Wheeler said. \" \u2026 Cynthia, the person who's taking my place, is here tonight. I so enjoy your enthusiasm. I've seen you at every meeting since you registered to run, so I'm pretty sure my seat's in good hands.\"\nHowie, an assistant principal at Federalsburg Elementary School, will have her seat filled by Karla Wieland-Cherry following the District 5 election.\nJackson and Dodson said they appreciate Howie's educational expertise in her 1.5 years on the board.\n\"It has been such an honor and a blessing to see you in this role,\" Jackson told Howie. \"When your name was thrown out there as somebody who could fill the empty (District 5) seat, I think I actually physically cheered. \u2026 It feels like you made a huge impact in your short time.\"\nHenry's seat will be assumed by Ann O'Connor, who won the District 2 election over Henry. The outgoing vice president is the director of Salisbury University's Disability Resource Center.\nJackson said she's \"so proud of the work\" she accomplished alongside Henry, who has often spearheaded special education and accessibility efforts carried out by the board.\n\"As I step away from this role, I encourage you all to stay focused on what truly matters \u2014 every student, and I mean every student,\" Henry said. \"Don't let individual agendas divide you or distract you from the essential work of seeing that every student is seen as valuable and worthy of our full support.\"\n\"I wish better for our community,\" she continued, \"but now I get to just hold people accountable from another seat, and that's exactly what I plan to do.\" \n\n Copyright  2024",

Although board members did not comment on the decision to terminate the contract at the meeting, board member Chris Wheedleton said in an email that the actions the board took were in support of Thompson's recommendations to \"equip\" educators with the best resources to \"get the best possible outcomes for our kids and our community.\"\n\"The board is working to encourage and support Dr. Thompson's plans to continuously review and refine the best approaches possible to create the best conditions for each of our students to thrive academically,\" Wheedleton said in the email.\nFour months earlier, the board voted to terminate its more than three-year contract with an alternative education program for high schoolers that would have cost the district over $3.3 million. The program had been met with criticism from residents since the contract for it was approved in September 2023. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said families are moving out of the district because they're concerned about sending their kids to Sandy Hill.\n\"Our school is old and falling apart,\" she said.\nMcGowan brought up plumbing issues in bathrooms, issues with the building's room temperatures and the difficulties of having to teach and learn in open concept classrooms. Other teachers brought up mold problems and critters and bugs getting into the building.\n\"There's organic growth in the building,\" Sandy Hill teacher Christy Starling said. \"Just two years ago, we had to push back our availability to enter the building prior to school starting due to massive mold infestation that had to be treated within a month before school started.\"\nAs part of the consent agenda passed during the meeting, the board voted in favor of having architecture firm Hord Coplan Macht do an ed specifications and feasibility study for the district's oldest elementary schools, including Sandy Hill.\nThe ed specifications and feasibility study is being funded by Maryland's Interagency Commission on School Construction. The IAC is also allocating money for school capital improvement projects in the county once the study has been completed.\nDuring a Board of Education work session in October, board members heard from the IAC on the different programs it operates and its projected budget allocations to Dorchester County.\nFor fiscal year 2026, the IAC estimates $2.75 million of its Capital Improvement Program will be allocated to Dorchester County, with a state cost share of 98%. The IAC'S Built To Learn Program, a temporary program created to hand out project-specific grants across the state, has $3.9 million budgeted for Dorchester County. Those funds need to be spent by 2031.\nAt the meeting Thursday, Assistant Superintendent of Administrative Services Michael Collins said it is important that the district moves forward with the ed specifications and feasibility study quickly because the IAC funding for it needs to be encumbered by the end of the year.\n\"We want to get this phase done so we can make big decisions on our old elementary schools,\" he said.\nCollins said the ed speculations process will take six months. He said a committee will work with the community to get an idea of what the ideal Dorchester County elementary school looks like. The feasibility study, he said, will determine what makes the most sense for each of the schools included.\n\"The feasibility study basically looks at each school and says, is it feasible to either renovate this school, replace this school or combine this school in order to make it fit with the ed spec?\" Collins said.\nOnce this process is complete, the district will be able to bid out capital improvement projects. Collins estimated it will take about a year to complete the studies.\nAt the end of the meeting, board member Talibah Chikwendu told the Sandy Hill teachers that she is sorry it will \"take so long\" to build a school.\n\"Because even though the things are in place for us to actually get a large amount of that money to get it done, the process takes a very long time,\" she said. \"I am sorry that you will have to continue to work in those conditions while we do so.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's a whole lot of fun. Eating, eating, eating,\" said Maisuh, who is pursuing a doctorate in economics at the University of Delaware.\n\"I feel like over here in America, everybody is like time-constrained, so it's an opportunity for families to come together and friends to come together and share and make merry,\" she added.\nOn Sunday, Maisuh was one of 500 international students and their family members who took part in the annual Thanksgiving dinner sponsored by UD's Center for Global Programs & Services. They gathered at the Trabant University Center and were treated to a full turkey dinner with all the fixings, plus pumpkin pie for dessert.\nThe event is a way to introduce international students to an American tradition, said Vina Titaley, associate director for international student engagement and success.\n\"It's an opportunity for students who have never experienced a Thanksgiving holiday to experience a Thanksgiving holiday,\" Titaley said. \"But also it's a way of building community amongst our international students.\"\nEach year, UD welcomes nearly 4,000 international students and visiting scholars representing 100 countries.\nDuring Thanksgiving week, the campus shuts down and most students head home to spend the holiday with family and friends. However, international students, for whom home is an ocean away, often stay on campus. The annual dinner at Trabant gives those students a place to celebrate the holiday and feel included.\n\"This event is extremely important from a sense of creating belonging and really telling our students that they matter,\" said Ravi Ammigan, associate provost for international programs. \"We are grateful to have such a large, diverse international student community on our campus.\"\nAmmigan is from Mauritius and still remembers his first American Thanksgiving nearly three decades ago. He was attending college in Chicago, and a professor invited him and other students over for dinner.\n\"It was new, but very impactful. I felt that I belonged, because when the campus was empty, I had a place to go,\" he recalled. \"And I think tonight, these students feel exactly the same way. They feel that this campus, this community, this university, cares. And we truly do.\"\nThe Center for Global Programs & Services started hosting a Thanksgiving dinner 11 years ago, with approximately 40 people attending. It has since grown into a signature event that students look forward to each year.\n\"We're all here, of course, to celebrate Thanksgiving,\" Ammigan said. \"But I think it's much more than that. It's to celebrate cultures around the world. It's to have gratitude for friendship and being able to be together in a learning environment like what the University of Delaware is.\"\nTitaley, who is originally from Indonesia, said many students are excited to try new foods.\n\"Turkey really is the highlight for a lot of students because turkey is kind of like a big icon for Thanksgiving,\" she said, adding that many students end up discovering that the side dishes are as delicious, if not more, than the turkey itself.\nNeha Sindhu, a native of India who is pursuing a doctorate in bioinformatics, said her favorite Thanksgiving food is pumpkin pie. She said she enjoys getting to experience Thanksgiving because it provides a slice of American culture.\n\"It feels like we belong here in this culture, in this country,\" Sindhu said. \"It feels good to have someone tell us that.\"\nFaith Wanjiku, from Kenya, is experiencing her first Thanksgiving. She came to UD 11 months ago to earn a master's degree in bioinformatics.\nShe said she was most looking forward to trying turkey.\n\"This event is very important because most of us cannot go home, so it's a good way to come together and meet with other people and give thanks to be here,\" Wanjiku said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline Commissioners hear update on potential for new middle school\n\n November 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 560\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 The Caroline County Commissioners were given an update Tuesday morning on potential plans for a new middle school in the county.Bill Mengel, director of operations at Caroline County Public Schools, presented a revised fiscal year 2026 capital improvement plan to the commission. That improvement plan includes a priority item of year one and year two funding for a potential new middle school building.\nMengel noted that while the district was in the \"talking phase\" in August and September, it has \"transitioned into the planning phase.\" This will soon include working with a consultant and eventually procuring a feasibility study, which may be complete in around six to eight months, Mengel said.\n\"One thing I've learned about building a new school is that it's a very serious endeavor,\" he said. \"It takes a very long time to build one, approximately five years. But things change very, very quickly. That's really what kind of happened here, early October.\"\nCurrently, Colonel Richardson Middle School in Federalsburg and Lockerman Middle School in Denton serve as the district's two middle schools. It is unclear if the district will aim to build an entire new school, renovate, or add on. Mengel said those outcomes are largely dependent on the feasibility study's recommendation and the Board of Education's subsequent approval or denial.\nThe revised capital improvement plan was unanimously approved by the three commissioners Tuesday. Its top priority requests are $500,000 for HVAC work at Denton Elementary School and $5.5 million in early planning and design costs for a new or expanded middle school over the next two fiscal years.\n$76 million in requested funding from the state for a new middle school build is listed next on the form. Mengel said that $76 million in requested state funding is around 89% of the total $86 million estimation for years one and two, meaning the county would be responsible for around 11% of the funding.\nMaryland's Interagency Commission on School Construction, which the funding form will be submitted to, is looking at an approximate capacity of 126,000 square feet for a potential new build, according to Mengel. Mengel said the district's main point of negotiation is \"How do we get more square footage?\"\nCost per square foot has risen sharply year to year, the director of operations noted.\n\"If we get shovels in the ground in FY28 and we're able to move in for FY30 school year, that could be at or north of $490 per square foot,\" Mengel said. \"So that's the driver.\"\nCommission President Travis Breeding asked that the school district keep the county updated on the early planning and feasibility study results.\n\"Keep us in the loop on the study, because we would like to, if we're on the hook for 11% of this, we'd like to have input into, is it a renovation, addition, new location, all those discussions,\" Breeding said.\nMengel said he doesn't want work to begin on a large capital project if it's not set to accommodate increases in student population.\n\"I am aware, and so is the Board of Education, that there are some communities that are planned in and around Denton and points north (in) Caroline County,\" Mengel said. \"We expect that there will be some students moving in impacting our populations. The last thing I want to do a build such as this, and then have it be at 100% occupancy within a couple of years.\" \n\n ",

    "content": "St. Michaels residents donate hygiene supplies for student success\n\n November 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 560\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS \u2014 Four St. Michaels residents are going out of their way to provide local students with hygiene supplies. They have donated products including dental floss, toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouthwash, deodorant, feminine hygiene products and soap.In collaboration with St. Michaels Middle/High School, this group is working to ensure students can focus on their studies without worrying about basic needs.\nThe initiative began in September when Kevin and Marybeth Sullivan attempted to make a donation for a back-to-school event hosted by the police station and Christ Church for the Smile Program. The Sullivans were told that the church had all the supplies it needed for the school year.\nWanting to put their donations to good use, they reached out to St. Michaels Commissioner Jay Hudson for an alternative way to help students. Hudson talked with a guidance counselor at the school, who said they were in need of hygiene supplies from pads and tampons to deodorant.\nHudson contacted fellow Commissioner Katrina Whittington. Together they used the Sullivan's funds to buy basic essentials for the St. Michaels students.\n\"There's so many ways in middle school and high school that you can get embarrassed, but it's not something you think about,\" Kevin Sullivan said. \"But what happens if a young woman goes into her period or something, \u2026 They either come from a family that can't afford it, or they're just unprepared for it.\"\nFor Hudson, the connection between a child's self-esteem and their academic achievement is incredibly important.\n\"I think self esteem and quality of life being the real undercurrent of this whole kind of idea,\" Hudson said. \"It kind of pours over because if they're comfortable in their skin and they're confident in their behaviors, then they're definitely going to have the opportunity to be more successful scholastically.\"\nHudson said any student needing hygiene items can reach out to Rebecca Mielke-Mann, assistant principal at St. Michaels Middle/High School, who is holding all the ready-to-use supplies.\nMielke-Mann said the donations have a significant impact on the school because they removes barriers to student success.\n\"When students have access to basic hygiene items, they can focus more on their education and less on personal insecurities or distractions,\" Mielke-Mann said. \"It helps create a more inclusive, positive learning environment and demonstrates to our students that their community cares about their well-being.\"\nMielke-Mann said particularly accessible hygiene products for girls are critical for ensuring that they can attend school confidently and consistently. According to Mielke-Mann, a lack of these items can lead to missed school days, distractions or discomfort, which can impact academic performance and self-esteem.\nBy providing these essentials, they're helping to level the playing field, Mielke-Mann said.\nAlthough there was no official plan for the duration of the program, Whittington said if funds are running low she would kick in money to replenish the supplies.\nThe Sullivans and Hudson agreed they would do the same. According to Hudson, the supplies have been well received by students, and Whittington and Hudson will be refilling some of the more used items.\nMarybeth Sullivan encourages anyone who has the inclination to support students to work with their local schools and see what needs aren't being met.\n\"I feel that most people really want to try to reach out and help other people,\" Marybeth Sullivan said. \"I don't think it's a unique thing by any means. So if they know the need, then I think they're happy to try to help.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Gala at Kennard honors former educators\n\n November 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 855\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Queen Anne's County Commissioners have pledged $50,000 in funding for each of the next three years to Kennard African American Cultural Heritage Center and Museum (KAACHC), while building upon the $140,000 they received from the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund, to support the hiring of an executive director to manage their programs and operations. The first installment of the county's pledge, a $50,000 check, was presented to Clay Washington, president of the Kennard Alumni Association Board of Directors, on Nov. 9, at the Kennard Gala Luncheon and Raffle event. The check was presented by County Commissioners Jim Moran and Chris Corchiarino.\"We are incredibly proud of the work the Kennard Alumni Association has done to preserve and celebrate African American heritage in Queen Anne's County,\" Moran said. \"The Kennard Center has grown into a vital resource for our community, providing educational and cultural opportunities that truly make a difference. We are excited to continue supporting their mission and to see how this new funding will help expand their programs even further. The County Commissioners are committed to ensuring the success of the Kennard Center and look forward to partnering with them for many years to come.\"\nThe county assisted the Kennard Alumni Association in applying for and securing a $140,000 grant from the National Trust for Historic Preservation's African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund.\nThe former high school building served as Queen Anne's County's only all-Black segregated high school until segregation ended in 1966, and integration took place within the county with the opening of Queen Anne's County High School in 1967.\nLeft in disrepair, continuing to disintegrate over the years, a motion was made to have the former school building razed. Former alumni of the school began fundraising efforts to have the building restored instead. The efforts were led by Kennard Alumni Association President Clayton Washington, formerly of Grasonville. Washington was persistent, organizing and planning for over 15 years, until donations and grants were obtained to begin the literal renovation process.\nWith restoration completed several years ago, the building was dedicated in 2019. A number of events have been held there since, and the building is open to the public for rental for special private celebrations and uses.\nThe next big step is to hire the Kennard AAHMCC executive director.\nWashington said, \"We have information for applying for the position listed on our website, kennardheritage.com . We've already received a couple applications, and hope to begin interviewing people within the next 30-days. It's hoped we will have someone hired to begin work by January 1, 2025.\"\nThe KAACHC is one of only 30 sites nationwide to receive funding from the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund, which awarded a total of $3 million to historic sites representing Black cultural heritage. KAACHC has become a hub for African American history programs, exhibits, and community events in Queen Anne's County. With more than $140 million raised to date, the Action Fund is the largest U.S. resource dedicated to preserving African American historic places.\nSince its establishment, KAACHC has played a vital role in providing educational and cultural learning opportunities, in Queen Anne's County. The center offers a variety of programs, including after-school mentoring, exercise classes, and summer camps for youth with special needs. With the hiring of a dedicated executive director, the center plans to expand its offerings to include adult literacy, STEM education, cultural arts, and more.\nThe Kennard Center is poised to become an even greater asset to Queen Anne's County, fostering connections within the community and preserving African American heritage for future generations.\nAlso, during the Nov. 9 program, Washington recognized and honored three former Kennard High School educators, Dr. Velma Kennedy Speight, Madelyn Matthews Hollis, and Alveta Smith Jones. Each had extensive careers in education, going well beyond teaching at Kennard.\nSpeight went on the teach several universities in Maryland, after serving as guidance counselor at Queen Anne's County High School. She was director of alumni affairs at North Carolina A & T University, where she had earned her bachelor's degree. Her service there was so profound, the university named one of the dormitories \"Speight Hall\".\nHollis transferred to QACHS where she taught until she retired, after teaching in the county for over 30-years. She then served on the county's Board of Education. Hollis was amazed that before segregation ended, African Americans could not try on clothes in stores when buying them, and personal mail could not be delivered to African American homes \u2014 they had to go to the post office to get their mail. She was a force in the community to see that the Kennard H.S. building was not torn down, but was restored to further serve the community.\nEven as a child growing up on the Eastern Shore, Jones dreamed of becoming a teacher. She began her teaching career at Kennard in 1947, Jones also taught overseas, teaching sixth graders while living in Istanbul, Turkey. She then returned to teach in Prince George's County Maryland Public Schools until she retired in 1981. She, Speight and Hollis have been loyal friends all of their adult lives.\nWashington presented all three ladies with plaques thanking them for their dedication to serving in education. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Up until her death, she served as executive director of New Beginnings.\nGoldie Cooper, who took over as the center's executive director after Stafford's death, said they didn't want to scrap the center's name, but wanted to incorporate Stafford into it.\n\"We just felt that to honor (Stafford), and all that she's done not just for New Beginnings, but for the community, that we would rename New Beginnings,\" Cooper said. \"Her name should be part of New Beginnings.\"\nCooper said she always considered Stafford \"our second Moses.\"\n\"Because she reminded me of Harriet Tubman,\" Cooper said. \"She was a fighter. And Theresa didn't just fight for the kids here or the people at Altair (Apartments). It was for the whole community.\"\nPeople would come into the New Beginnings office who were having problems paying their electric bills, Cooper said, and Stafford would help get them the resources they needed.\nCooper said Stafford made sure the children at New Beginnings participated in field trips and had' experiences they might not have had without the program.\nAnd when issues would arise outside New Beginnings due to the prevalence of drugs and gang violence in the area, Stafford would go out and talk with who was there, Cooper said, \"and they respected her enough to just move on.\"\nAshley Stafford said the learning center's new name will ensure her mother's \"name essentially now becomes a part of the story, so every child, every parent, every staff member that walks through those doors will remember that legacy.\"\nAshley Stafford said one of her mother's favorite sayings was, \"If you can see it, you can be it.\"\n\"And so having her name on that sign, it'll just remind the kids to dream big,\" she said. \"And I think it will motivate the staff, too, to continue pouring love into the kids. And (motivate) the kids to strive to make her proud because they always wanted to make her proud.\"\nCooper said Phil Feldman, an old classmate of Theresa Stafford's, was instrumental in helping get the center's name changed. In July, he donated $25,000 to the center in an effort to ensure Theresa Stafford's legacy lives on.\nLiving Water Ministry Pastor Joe Kelly said buildings are renamed for two reasons: If someone has donated a lot of money or if someone has left their legacy. He said Theresa Stafford has left a legacy of hard work and generational change.\n\"I think we have to understand that what Theresa did, it wasn't just for the kids she had this year, the kids she had next year,\" Kelly said. \"She literally looked at it as trying to bring generational change. And to me, that's the difference between legacy and inheritance.\"\nKelly, a friend of Stafford's for years, called the learning center \"a vital part of the community,\" pointing out the challenges of the area it's located in.\n\"In the midst of the chaos and in the midst of all the things that happen there, there is a place where kids can come and they're loved, they're protected, they're fed, they're given an opportunity to change and make a difference,\" he said.\nA ribbon cutting and dedication ceremony for the center's new name will be held at the center on Saturday, Nov. 30, at noon. There will be a variety of speakers as well as tours of the center. Cooper said they will unveil the center's new sign at the event.\nAshley Stafford said the event coincides with what would have been her mother's 71st birthday.\n\"I think it's kind of kismet that it's on her birthday,\" she said. \"You know, it could be a time of sadness and remembrance. But instead, it'll be celebratory.\"\n\"The best birthday gift you could give her would be to donate to the GoFundMe,\" Ashley said, later adding, \"And the support is just going to help to continue creating opportunities for the kids.\"\nThose interested in donating to Dr. Theresa Stafford's New Beginnings Learning Academy can do so at gofundme.com/f/keep-dr-staffords-dream-alive-donate-to-new-beginnings?qid=ad5893547972b58a294c37898c157c95. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "More than half of Talbot County students receive free and reduced lunches\n\n November 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Life \n \n 944\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 More than half of students in Talbot County Public Schools receive free or reduced cost meals at school every week, according to the Maryland Department of Education.Free and reduced meals allow them to eat well at school.\n\"It is basically healthy for them. They get a fruit, a vegetable, a protein and they get a milk,\" said Michelle Garniga, assistant coordinator at the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center for the after school program. She has six children in TCPS.\nThe number of free and reduced meals in a school is a measure of poverty and food insecurity in a community.\nThe Maryland Department of Education found 58.41% of the students in Talbot County received free and reduced meals in 2022-2023, just under 13% higher than it was the school year prior.\nAt some county schools, this rate is even higher.\n\"What drives up the numbers are Easton Middle School and Easton Elementary School,\" said Catharine Poe of the Talbot Hunger Coalition, an organization of food banks and resources fighting food insecurity in the county. \"Easton Elementary is 76% and the Middle School is 64%.\"\nAt other schools, numbers alone may not be enough to gauge the full scope of students' needs. Poe said the Easton High numbers trend lower because the kids do not want the other kids to know they need food.\nDebbie Gardner, communications director for Talbot County Public Schools, said \"We definitely talk about hunger. We consider feeding children to be one of our responsibilities in addition to educating them. We know the needs are greater than even what we see on paper.\"\nFOOD INSECURITYThe increased rate of students receiving free and reduced meals mirrors a growing amount of food insecurity in Talbot County, where costs of food, housing and other necessities are outpacing salary growth.\n\"If you make $15 an hour (minimum wage) and work every single day for a 40 hour week, you only make $31,000. So if you have a family, that is not going to go very far. As soon as you have multiple children, it becomes impossible,\" Poe said. She said you need $38,000 for one person to make it in Talbot County.\nEmily Moody, cofounder of CarePacks, said they started the nonprofit because \"on weekends some kids were not eating until they got back to school on Monday morning. That is the nature of food insecurity \u2014 the uncertainty. Free and reduced meals are a lifeline. No question about it.\"\n\"Food insecurity is on the rise everywhere,\" Moody said. \"What we have seen in the school system is an increase in the free and reduced meals program. People are working, but at wages that are not a livable wage and we live in an area where the cost of housing is really exorbitant. The cost for basic necessities like food and gas and utilities have increased. The place where the budget gets squeezed is with food at the grocery budget.\"\nKatie Fox, community school program manager at Easton Elementary School, is the school based coordinator for CarePacks.\n\"Transportation impacts, if you don't have reliable transportation, which a lot of people in Talbot County don't have. That is a non-negotiable,\" Fox said.\nAnd if you live in the far corners of Talbot County like Tilghman Island, it is hard to even get to a grocery store.\"\nMoody said, \"For people who are working full time to be able to afford housing and afford transportation and insurance and utilities. When those needs are met , then ideally there is room in your budget to be able to feed your family too.\"\nIt is not an issue of lazy for the working poor.\n\"It is not that people are not going to work. It is just that living is really expensive right now,\" Fox said.\nFREE AND REDUCED MEALS HELPFamilies in need benefit from the free and reduced meals at the TCPS, which ensure students receive at least two meals a day for five days a week.\n\"It is not easy to give $4 every single day to four or five kids. That is like $24 a day. It would be fairer if everyone got free food. Just because you make more money, it is not fair for kids not to get the lunch,\" Garniga said.\nGarniga said without the program she would be in debt and that over $100 a week for food would be a lot.\n\"It takes a lot of pressure off especially if you have a household with several kids. Being able to rely on the school system to provide breakfast and lunch every day, it is one of the biggest roles that the school plays,\" Poe said.\n\"They have figured out that it would save the average family $1,200 a child each year. It would end all this, and everybody who goes to school gets a free meal,\" Poe said.\nChildren in Talbot County are not alone in experiencing the benefits of free and reduced lunch programs.\nAt the state level, Gov. Wes Moore has signed a state Senate bill requiring the Maryland Department of Education to report to the General Assembly how much it will cost to provide free meals to all public school students in Maryland.\nSB 579 opens with, \"The Maryland General Assembly recognizes the positive impact on student's academic, physical and social and emotional health that results from ensuring students have access to breakfast and lunch programs while at school.\"\nFiguring out how much it costs is the next step in pursuing universal expansion of free school meals, lawmakers argue.\nThe bill still needs to be funded, and it looks like the state budget is getting tighter. According to the latest briefing in the state's Spending Affordability Committee, there is a projected $2.7 billion budget shortfall that will confront the state legislature in January. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She previously worked at Caroline County Public Schools in various teacher and administrative roles for a combined 36 years, retiring in 2009.\n\"I can promise you as president of your board, I will do the very best that I can do,\" Wayman said during Tuesday evening's meeting.\nBartz nominated Mark Jones to once again serve as vice president of the board alongside Weaver. All five members voted in favor.\nBartz, who was appointed in June to the Board of Education, ran unopposed in District 1. She is the director of community based programs at Choptank Community Health, overseeing the school-based health centers and serving as a provider at Greensboro Elementary.\nIn an interview, she said she's \"excited\" about the district's direction, particularly the fact that eight of nine schools are designated community schools by the state's education initiative, Blueprint for Maryland's Future.\n\"In a county that's rural, it is really important that we recognize that our schools really are hubs in our community and that we can bring a lot of resources to families and kids alongside of the education that they receive in those buildings,\" Bartz said. \"It's a safe place for families.\"\nAssuming outgoing President Richard Barton's District 2 seat is Johnson, who also ran unopposed. In an interview with the Star Democrat, Johnson said she's looking forward to the new role.\nAt first, she was hesitant about running, but the idea grew over time as she thought about her 11- and 14-year-old daughters, who both attend Caroline County schools. She said it's a great way to be a part of \"conversations that can make change.\"\n\"When you're a parent sitting on the 'outside, you hear all of these things, and they may not necessarily make sense to you as a parent,\" Johnson said. \"People get in their emotions and they run with that. But I'm that type of person that I want to know why, and I'm going to go straight to the source to figure that answer out.\"\nJohnson is the executive director of the His Hope Ministries shelter in Denton and a board member for the Caroline County Chamber of Commerce.\n\"There's still parts of Caroline County that I haven't gotten to see or be connected with,\" Johnson said, \"so I'm really excited to be able to go to different parts of the county and just see what's happening, see what schools are doing.\"\nThis report has been updated to correct the spelling of Michele Wayman's name. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In referring to the recent election, Ms. Gill states that the newly elected Talbot County school board members Ann O'Connor and Karla Wieland-Cherry are also members of Moms for Liberty. Ms. Gill describes the Moms as a \"conservative national group\" who advocate for \"changes in curriculum and policies.\"First of all, both Mrs. O'Connor and Mrs. Cherry have repeatedly stated they are not members of Moms for Liberty; they merely participated in a debate sponsored by the Moms in which, to her credit, Ms. Jurrius also took part.\nSecondly, Moms for Liberty is a support group for parents, teachers and citizens who are concerned with the education of the next generation. They provide resources for parents as well as information in educational trends throughout the country. While I have never attended one of their meetings, I do receive their newsletter and follow them on social media. Plus I have numerous friends who regularly attend the meetings.\nTheir agenda is to maintain parental rights through grades K through 12. Additionally, Superintendent Dr. Sharon Pepukayi, and even some of her staff, have attended three or four meetings. If it was so extreme why would they continue to return? Why is this continually portrayed by the Left as a terrible thing?\nThirdly, I wish Ms. Gill had been more specific when mentioning the \"changes in curriculum and policies\" that the Moms are advocating. Is she referring to better scores in English and mathematics, which the Moms advocate? Is she referring to less violence in the schools and classrooms, which they also advocate? Does she mean the schools' dispensing of contraceptives to children, opposed not only by the Moms but also by many parents?\nAs for the mention of concentration camps, in 2019 Trump was criticized by the Left for detention centers that had been built by Obama. Remember the children in cages? That happened under Obama, too. Trying to conflate Trump with the Nazis by mentioning \"concentration camps\" is actually a horrific insult to the millions of victims of the real Nazis. Plus everyone was trying to escape from Hitler's Germany. If America was so bad under Trump, why did people still risk their lives and fortunes to live here?\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A group of Morton's former third grade students at Trappe Elementary School reminisced over lunch.\nSharing stories with one another before Morton arrived, many said she was far and away their \"favorite teacher.\" Morton, who taught at Trappe Elementary School for more than 20 years and still lives in Trappe, turned 100 on May 24.\n\"Can you believe it?\" said Linda James, one of her former students. \"She's 100 years old, and she still knows us.\"\nFellow classmate Ruth Worm said when she and a couple others realized Morton had recently hit her milestone birthday, they knew they needed to organize a time to catch up.\n\"When I called her, she was just (so) excited,\" Worm said. \"She said, 'Oh this is going to be so wonderful.'\"\n\"She was just very genuinely nice and kind,\" Worm said, recalling how Morton treated all of her students the same.\nMany of those that joined to celebrate on Friday graduated high school in 1971 and had Morton as their teacher in the 1961-1962 school year. They recalled what made Morton so memorable and impactful on their lives, even at such a young age.\n\"She left a lasting impression on all of us,\" James said, adding that Morton was \"very sweet\" but still garnered respect from the students. \"She controlled the classroom. She didn't let us walk all over.\"\nAt the time, James said teachers such as Morton were such an integral part of children's lives and growing up. \"That's all we knew, was home and teachers,\" James said.\nFor Susan Watts, Morton's excellence in teaching had a twofold impact. Watts not only had Morton in third grade, but Watts' daughter had the revered teacher in kindergarten as well. Morton's kindness since Watts first met her has carried on ever since, the former student said.\n\"She's still really warm, a very warm person,\" said Watts.\nMorton said she \"loved teaching\" and it's what she wanted to do when going to college. But that aspiration came and went during her college years.\n\"When I went to college, that's what I wanted to do,\" Morton said. \"And walking down the halls my freshman year (hearing), 'What are you going to do when you graduate in June?'\n'Oh I don't know, be a teacher I guess,' And I thought well, that's not for me. So I didn't graduate to be a teacher.\"\nHowever, the itch came back, and she went back into the education field \u2014 a decision that surely changed the lives of many who grew up attending Trappe Elementary.\nOn Friday, Morton went around the table, talking to each of her former students. She recalled how one student had a knack for rope climbing back in school.\nNot one student was a troublemaker or misbehaved, Morton said to the Elks Lodge waitress.\n\"Now when we got to the fourth grade, that was a different subject,\" one of her former students joked.\nWhen asked her favorite part of teaching those present on Friday, the same people who sat in her third grade classroom over a half-decade ago, Morton said it was all about the students.\n\"When you had a group like this, why wouldn't they be good?\" Morton said. \n\n Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Stars are gained using multiple indicators, including academic achievement, academic progress, graduation rate and school quality.\nAccording to the report card, the academic achievement indicator went up 0.2 points \u2014 from 7.6 to 7.8 \u2014 overall at Dorchester elementary schools. At Dorchester middle schools, the academic achievement indicator went up 0.6 points, from 6.7 to 7.3 points. Elementary and middle schools can receive up to 20 points for academic achievement.\nDorchester high schools increased their academic achievement overall by 1.1 point, from 12 to 13.1 points. High schools can receive up to 30 points for academic achievement.\nThe school district news release also stated districtwide improvement in English language arts and math proficiency as well as improved graduation and attendance rates.\n\"While our schools have shown movement in a positive direction, some areas and schools have seen significant gains with others advancing more slowly,\" Superintendent Jymil Thompson said in the news release. \"To achieve our ambitious goal of moving from 23rd to 15th in academic performance statewide, a larger percentage of growth is necessary. Continued focus on targeted strategies and interventions will be crucial to accelerate this progress.\"\nSince becoming superintendent in June, Thompson has made known his hope of bringing the district's ranking up from 23rd to 15th in the state in four years. This year, the district is focusing on instructional leadership, taking a top-down approach in an effort to improve student success.\nIn September, Thompson told the Star Democrat that in order to jump from 23rd in the state to 15th in four years, the district will need to be consistent with developing instructional leadership and following through on it.\n\"Making sure that I'm having meetings with the principals, having conversations on how they're progressing on their goals,\" he said in September. \"And if they're not progressing, how can we shift and go in a little different direction to ensure that they're meeting their goals?\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline superintendent projects 'good budget year,' discusses Blueprint\n\n December 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 617\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 At last week's Caroline County Board of Education meeting, Superintendent Derek Simmons provided board members with a preview into the district's fiscal year 2026 outlook as budget season nears.Simmons said he and his team are in the process of developing a draft budget. What happens in this year's state legislative session is expected to impact how the budget looks, the superintendent said.\n\"We are really contingent upon what happens at the state level for our funding, and we do expect the General Assembly to be very engaged in things that could impact us budget-wise,\" Simmons said. \"So it is 100% likely we will not have a clear picture of our budget, of our revenue numbers until mid-April at best.\"\nAt the Dec. 3 meeting, Simmons reviewed the fiscal year 2025 budget, noting that around 60% of unrestricted funds were spent on salaries and wages. Those funds largely come from the state, as the district received around 66% of its FY25 revenue from the state in unrestricted money.\n\"When we talk about where our expenses come from, it's people,\" Simmons said. \"No surprise as we've said for years, we are a people business. It takes people to educate children. It takes people to make school work.\"\nContracted services accounted for just under 7% of the unrestricted budget. Board Member Troy Plutschak said he wants the board to find out how much auditing through outside companies costs.\nSimmons said the district is often audited, but that moving audits in-house would be difficult and put the district in a \"world of hurt.\" Potentially, one or two finance-related positions would be added, along with adding a stress onto the workload of school principals, Simmons said.\nAccording to the superintendent, he doesn't expect federal money or county allocations to drastically change heading into fiscal year '26. \"We knew '25 was the tight year,\" he said.\nAssuming no major changes are made to the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's initiative to increase education funding, Simmons has an optimistic outlook. That's partly due to increased multilingual learner, special education and overall enrollment in the county.\n\"We are anticipating what should be a good budget year for Caroline County Public Schools,\" Simmons told the board.\nBLUEPRINTWhile there was positivity in the fiscal year 26 forecast, Simmons made clear to board members that the outlook could drastically change if state legislators enact major adjustments to funding in Blueprint.\nChanges to fiscal 26 funding \"can have absolute detrimental impacts to Caroline County Public Schools,\" he said, since Caroline County Public Schools is \"not a district that has extra wealth to go to to fill gaps.\"\n\"Not trying to paint a dire picture, but I don't want to paint roses where they may not exist,\" he said. \"They should. But I want to make sure that everybody in the public is very clear as well. It should be, but if they go changing things in the FY 26 formula, it will hurt in this county more so than others probably.\"\nState legislators may be tasked with discussions about Blueprint funding this winter, as the state faces a predicted budget deficit of $2.7 million for fiscal year 2026.\nBlueprint will require all schools to meet a minimum teacher salary of $26,000 by July 2026. Caroline County Public Schools has not met that mark yet, but Simmons said the district is making progress.\n\"We are still working to get our starting teacher salary up to the mandated $60,000 by FY27,\" Simmons said. \"We have done a great job through negotiations. We're roughly $5,000 away.\"\nLooking to the next budget cycle, salaries and maintaining adequate staffing levels are at the top of mind for the superintendent and his team.\n\"We need to stay competitive with salaries and benefits for all employees,\" Simmons said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, Easton Middle was the lone school in the district to lose a star compared to 2023 ratings.The report card, released by the Maryland State Department of Education on Dec. 3, awards schools points based on performance in four categories: academic achievement, academic progress, progressing in achieving English language arts proficiency, and school quality and student success.\nEaston Middle notched a two-star rating and 32nd percentile rank, down from three stars and 48th percentile last year. Star rating and percentile rank are based off of a school's total points out of 100. Easton Middle scored 44, down from 46.1 in 2023.\nEaston Middle's 2024 scores in academic achievement (7.7 out of 30) and academic progress (16.7 out of 35) remained the same. It increased slightly in English proficiency, from 2.2 to 2.6 out of 10 total points, while decreasing from 19.5 to 17.1 points out of 35 total in school quality and student success.\nTalbot County Public Schools' Director of Communications Debbie Gardner said in a statement that the district is \"closely examining\" the report card results. \"Findings and recommendations\" will be presented to the Talbot County Board of Education at its Dec. 18 meeting, she added.\n\"We are encouraged by the improvement shown in student proficiency in both math and English language arts in all of our student groups,\" the statement read. \"There was progress in other areas as a result of our continued focus on our district priorities. We also see opportunities for additional data collection and analysis to inform our short and long-term planning.\"\nOf the eight schools in the district, St. Michaels Elementary rose from three to four stars, while White Marsh Elementary had the district's largest percentile increase, from the 69th in 2023 to the 82nd percentile in 2024.\nOTHER SCHOOLSOf all schools in Caroline, Dorchester and Talbot counties, Easton Middle was the only one to see a year-to-year decrease in its star rating, though other schools did drop in their percentiles or overall points.\nCompared to fellow middle schools, Easton's 2024 rank slots in above Mace's Lane Middle (two stars, 6th percentile) and Lockerman Middle (two stars, 30th percentile), but below North Dorchester Middle (three stars, 56th percentile) and Colonel Richardson Middle (three stars, 62nd percentile).\nBy student group, the Easton school had mixed results. All student groups saw year-to-year increases in English proficiency except for Black and African American students. Asian students and economically disadvantaged students reached their annual targets in English proficiency, according to the report card results.\nHowever, in math proficiency, only Asian students and multilingual learners improved from 2023. None of the subgroups reached their annual targets in math proficiency.\nTo view the full Maryland School Report Card, visit reportcard.msde.maryland.gov/. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore (D), Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County). The letter stated that record education spending by Maryland counties in recent years and additional mandated funding for Blueprint will make it difficult for counties to fund other things in their jurisdictions.\nDuring Thursday's MACo session, titled \"What we've learned About Learning: The Blueprint in Year Three,\" panelist and Charles County Blueprint Coordinator Christina Miller spoke on the importance of equity, saying that it's not only important to make sure every district gets a shoe, but every district gets a \"shoe that fits.\" She said it is time for a readjustment of Blueprint.\n\"Are we calling the baby ugly? No,\" she said. \"But frankly, it is time for an assessment to see what's working and what's not working.\"\nPanelist and Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said that something written three years ago isn't going be perfect today. He said everything needs to be revisited.\n\"The Blueprint is no different,\" he said. \"We can still achieve the outcomes. We can probably do them better if we take the time to revisit what was passed with a lens of local flexibility and understanding (the) context of each and every 24 (local education agencies).\"\nPanelist and Harford County Public Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson pointed to some of the progress his district has made in implementing the Blueprint before mentioning recommendations made by the state's superintendents to reduce the Blueprint's overall cost.\nBulson said achievements in his county include making \"good progress\" toward increasing teacher starting salaries to $60,000. He said last school year, no 4-year-olds \"with the greatest needs\" were turned away from public pre-K in Harford County.\n\"While this isn't the end goal that the Blueprint envisioned, it's great progress that, again, wouldn't have been made without the Blueprint,\" Bulson said.\nDuring the question-and-answer portion of the session, St. Mary's County Commissioner Mike Hewitt said he didn't want to raise county taxes in order to pay for the Blueprint. He asked the moderator of the session, Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Wicomico, Worcester), what can be expected from the General Assembly.\nCarozza said Gov. Wes Moore has said he would be willing to make some adjustments to Blueprint. She said it will be important that the school districts and counties stand together with their priorities \"(so) that we can make the changes that you're calling for.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The program serves pre-K through second graders in the district.\nThe agreement will allow the current Positive Change Academy staff to finish out the school year.\nIn October, the board voted to terminate a one-year contract with Transforming Lives, the company that brought the Positive Change Academy to the district. Transforming Lives had been using PASS Educators to provide staffing at the academy.\nIn an email Friday, DCPS Communications and Community Outreach Specialist Valerie Goff said the academy is still under contract with Transforming Lives, but that contract is \"due to end imminently.\"\nWith the new agreement, the Positive Change Academy staff provided by PASS Educators will be able to continue to serve district students after the contract has been terminated.\nAt the board's last meeting in November, the board voted against pursuing contracts with other alternative education companies that reached out through a request for proposal.\nSuperintendent Jymil Thompson said at the November meeting that the district and board had reviewed the proposals and he recommended they not move forward with any of them due to \"budgetary restraints.\" He said the district would instead work to continue staffing its Positive Change Academy.\nThe agreement with PASS Educators will cost the district $238,000.\nBefore the board voted on the PASS Educators agreement, multiple people \u2014 including Positive Change Academy staff \u2014 spoke in favor of it.\nRonnell Page, the founder of PASS Educators, said his company was introduced to Dorchester County Public Schools about three months ago due to an \"essential need\" with the elementary alternative education program. He said that over the past two months, he has been traveling to the district to show support. He said they have staff in place that \"genuinely cares\" and wants to do the best for the students.\n\"We really believe we can make a huge impact from Hurlock all the way to Cambridge,\" he said.\nDane Harris, the principal at the Positive Change Academy, said that when he stepped into the role, the program was \"in a state of crisis.\" He said that since then, there has been \"undeniable\" growth, both academically and behaviorally. Harris said this wouldn't be possible without the academy's current staff.\n\"The staff members are not just employees, they are the backbone of this program,\" he said. \"They've earned the trust of students. They deserve the opportunity to continue to do great work.\"\nAfter the board voted in favor of the agreement, people in the audience clapped.\nAt the end of the meeting, board member Brandy Dawson Cumberland spoke about the importance of consistency for students. She said she hopes the district can have a steady program without \"consistent turnover.\"\nBoard member Christine LaMonica thanked those from the Positive Change Academy that spoke during the meeting.\n\"I think as we sit here as a board and always consider our students first, it's good to hear that there's passion for our students and for their academic achievement, as well as their behavioral and mental health,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They will remain in those roles for a year.\nIn July, Hubbard and Chikwendu were elected to their respective roles after former Board President Mike Diaz and former Vice President Susan Morgan resigned for separate reasons.\nDuring the meeting Dec. 12, Hubbard thanked the board for their \"vote of confidence.\"\n\"I will try to do my very best to serve you well,\" she said.\nAt the end of the meeting, other board members congratulated the two.\n\"Thank you for your leadership and for agreeing to continue,\" board member Chris Wheedleton said.\nWheedleton and fellow board members Brandy Dawson Cumberland and Christine LaMonica were all sworn in for another term at the beginning of the same meeting.\nThis will be Wheedleton, Cumberland and LaMonica's first full term. All three were appointed to replace former board members.\nWheedleton was appointed to the board in 2023 to replace former board member Laura Layton, who resigned from the board that April. Wheedleton won against Jerome Harris to maintain his seat in the recent Nov. 5 general election.\nIn July, both LaMonica and Cumberland were appointed to the board. LaMonica was appointed to fill Morgan's seat after she resigned in mid-June following a contentious board vote to terminate an alternative education contract.\nCumberland was appointed to fill Diaz's seat after he resigned in late June, citing family and health concerns.\nBefore being appointed, LaMonica and Cumberland had been running against Morgan and Diaz, respectively, in the 2024 general election. Both LaMonica and Cumberland ultimately ran unopposed in the November election, allowing them to stay in the roles they were appointed to for another four years. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Vision from the beginning': BAAM leaders excited for new academic center\n\n December 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 559\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The tall, welcoming windows in the classrooms of Building African American Minds Inc.'s new academic center in Easton don't just bring in sunlight. They connect the surrounding residents to new opportunities.Three stories high and nearly 25,000 square feet, the center will house classes, tutoring, youth programs, community gatherings and more. It sits on Jowite Street, next to the BAAM Athletic Center and across from a large residential area.\nJames Bell, director of instruction, academic support and community wellbeing for the nonprofit, believes the space fits within the organization's mission of creating an educational and social space for underserved children in the area.\n\"The excitement really is looking out of the windows and seeing the potential,\" Bell says. \"So when you see the community, out of every window here in the facility, it lets you know that it's an opportunity for them as well.\"\nSaturday, Building African American Minds will cut the ribbon on the academic center, which is expected to be up and running in January. The center will allow the nonprofit to significantly expand how many children it serves in after-school and summer enrichment programs.\nThere is a library, media center and multipurpose dining room on the first floor. Above are eight classrooms, as well as speciality rooms for esports, art and music.\nClassrooms are designed with desks situated for full-group, small-group and individual learning.\nDina Daly, executive director of Building African American Minds, pointed out a wellness wing, which will be a private space for health, counseling and more. She added that BAAM's sister agency, private school Polaris Village Academy, will operate out of the academic center in 2025.\nWhile the organization's focus has been serving under-resourced youth in the nearby neighborhoods, its reach isn't limited to children or Talbot County residents, Daly says.\nAdult workforce programs will be hosted in the new academic center during the day. On the third floor, Chesapeake College will begin hosting GED and English second language classes in February.\n\"We had a vision from the beginning,\" Daly said. \"So we're just following up on our vision for what we thought needed to happen, not just for the youth.\"\nIn its 20th year, Building African American Minds has long hoped for an academic center like the one that sits on Jowite Street today. Its previous hub, the athletic center next to the new building, isn't going anywhere either.\nHowever, the new academic center was about a $10 million project, Daly said, more than double what the athletic center cost. Private donors, community donations, and state and federal funding made it possible.\n\"We build for the future,\" Daly said. \"From the inception of BAAM, we always talked about building a school and academic center. It's more than a school now. It's more like a community center, really.\"\nDaly said it's been a long process, but she knows the wait was worth it. Starting small and meeting a select group's needs instead of going too broad, such as when the organization began as a boys-only nonprofit in 2005, was the path to success.\nReflecting on the fact that a 20-year goal is finally coming to fruition, Daly hopes the journey of Building African American Minds can inspire others to start small and dream big.\n\"That's why I tell people, 'don't give up on your dreams,'\" Daly said. \"Make smaller goals, make them achievable, and then just keep building it up. And look at what we've accomplished.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

While accepting the grant, UD certified that the money would not be used to collaborate or coordinate with China.\nHowever, the government later learned that one of lead professors associated with the grant, Xiao-Hai Yan, did in fact have ties to China.\nYan is a faculty member at Xiamen University in China, received funding from the National Science Foundation of China and participates in a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with knowledge or or access to foreign technology intellectual property, according to the settlement.\nThe settlement does not constitute an admission of liability by UD, nor does it prevent the government from pursuing criminal charges against any parties involved.\n\"Along with our law enforcement partners, we will continue to safeguard taxpayer funds that are intended for federal research and development programs,\" said Adelle Harris, a special agent in charge for the NASA inspector general.\nYan has been a UD professor since 1990. He teaches in the School of Marine Science and Policy and serves as director of the Center for Remote Sensing.\nAccording to a profile of Yan on UD's marketing website, he is \"internationally known for using satellites in tracking the notorious weathermaker El Ni\u00f1o and in developing new techniques for monitoring global climate change and coastal responses.\" In 2019, he received the Outstanding Doctoral Graduate Advising and Mentoring Award from UD President Dennis Assanis.\nThe article also praises Yan for playing \"an integral role in the university's efforts to improve and expand the intellectual exchange between UD and Xiamen University\" \u2014 the Chinese university that UD failed to disclose Yan's involvement with while accepting the NASA grant.\nIn a statement to media outlets, the university said it \"relies, in part, on the candor and complete disclosures of individuals involved in the grant process. As noted in the release, this settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing by the University, but rather a strategic decision to avoid costly and distracting litigation.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Chopping block or all talk: How much will Trump, GOP Congress cut federal education spending?",
    "date": "2024-12-17",

    "content": "Chopping block or all talk: How much will Trump, GOP Congress cut federal education spending?\n\n December 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG Media | Section: National \n \n 1407\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. Department of Education (DOE) and the federal government roles in K-12 public education are potentially on the chopping block with President-elect Donald Trump and a new Republican Congress taking office next month.That's at least according to campaign stump rhetoric, Trump's own pronouncements and conservative policy blueprints \u2014 including the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025.\n\"Federal education policy should be limited and, ultimately, the federal Department of Education should be eliminated,\" according to Project 2025's policy recommendations. The agency has a total budget of $241.7 billion.\nProject 2025, which stirred criticism from the left during the 2024 campaign, calls for Title 1 federal funding for poorer schools to be shifted back to the states and localities. Title 1 funding totaled more than $18.4 billion in fiscal year 2024, according to the Center for American Progress.\nOther federal education spending would be shifted to other departments, converted into grants to states and localities or eliminated.\nThe goal is to minimize the federal role in education and have localities and states enable (and fund) education savings accounts (ESAs) for parents and guardians to use for charter and private schools and other options.\nTrump has distanced himself from Project 2025 saying he was not involved in its formation and he does not agree with all its ideas. But Trump recently told Time Magazine \u2014 which named him 2024 Person the Year \u2014 he favored eliminating DOE.\n\"You're going to need some people just to make sure they're teaching English in the schools. Okay, you know English and mathematics, let's say. But we want to move education back to the states,\" Trump said.\nHezekiah Herrera, a special education teacher in San Diego, has been following the issue and how what happens in Washington might impact school districts and special needs instruction.\n\"Advocates say that diminished federal power grants states and localities more control to shape policies to suit their specific needs. Some also argue that it will spur innovation and cut bureaucratic red tape, resulting in efficient, more streamlined decision-making,\" Herrera said. \"On the other hand, a lack of federal guidance may exacerbate allocation inequalities, especially in states with fewer resources.\"\nAxing or gutting, Title 1 and other programs aimed at helping poor kids worries Stefano Lodola, owner of Think Languages LLC and Think in Italian (a Wyoming-based foreign language instruction company).\n\"The consequences of cutting or eliminating the DOE would be widespread and severe. Federal funding, which constitutes approximately 8% of total K-12 education funding nationwide, plays a vital role in supporting programs like Title I, which serves over 25 million students in low-income areas, and Pell Grants, which help nearly 7 million college students afford higher education,\" Lodola said. \"Without these funds, disparities between wealthier and poorer states would likely grow, leaving underfunded schools even more resource starved.\"\nProject 2025 and conservatives also oppose expansions of free and reduced lunch programs at poorer schools. That $17.2 billion program serves 28 million low-income kids and is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nThe Project 2025 blueprint and some Republicans also want to eliminate Head Start \u2014 a $11.4 billion program that provides preschools to close to 800,000 lower-income kids. They contend it is inefficient and wasteful.\nIt is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nTherein lies some of the rub when it comes to a conservative, Trump or government efficiency efforts to be championed by Elon Musk.\nBen Wallerstein, CEO of Whiteboard Advisors (a Washington D.C.-based education policy and consulting firm), said in addition to education programs handled by other agencies, a number of federal education statutes \"long predate the creation of the Department of Education.\"\nHe said narrow GOP majorities in Congress and the complexities of shuttering an entire agency and accompanying statutes make the odds of a complete DOE closure long.\n\"Eliminating the department would require statutory change. Republican lawmakers will introduce bills to that effect, but Democratic Senators can rely on the filibuster to stop the process. In the end, a complete elimination of the department seems unlikely,\" Wallerstein said in a post-election analysis.\nPatrick Riccards, who served as an education advisor and consultant to the Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama administrations, said some of the education talk from the right may be just that \u2014 talk.\n\"We've been talking about getting rid of the U.S. Department of Education since it was founded in the seventies,\" Riccards said.\nHe said a complete elimination is doubtful, but he does see moves to give states and localities more flexibility in how they spend federal money and how they approach K-12 schools.\n\"Congress isn't really interested in public education. They believe it is a state and local issue,\" said Riccards, who also previously served on the school board in Falls Church, Virginia.\nThat's what the Heritage Foundations and conservatives want.\n\"The future of education freedom and reform in the states is bright and will shine brighter when regulations and red tape from Washington are eliminated. Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes. It raises the cost of education without raising student achievement,\" the conservative think tank writes in its controversial report.\nSPECIA\nL EDUCATION\nApproximately 7.6 million special needs students receive special education services funded via the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). That's 15% of all public school students.\nWhen IDEA was approved in 1975, advocates hoped to see the feds cover 40% of special education costs. For 2024, Congress and the Biden administration allocated $15.4 billion under IDEA, according to the Congressional Research Service.\nContemporary funding covers 14.7% of total special education spending, according to the Special Needs Alliance. Full funding requires $43.3 billion, according to SNA.\nLodola worries about special education potentially getting hit hard by federal rollbacks or a downsized DOE.\n\"The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which ensures that 7.6 million students with disabilities receive a free and appropriate public education, depends heavily on federal funding and enforcement. Without the DOE, many states may lack the resources or political will to adequately support these programs, leaving vulnerable children and their families to shoulder the burden,\" he said.\nHerrera agrees.\n\"Without a department, the future of IDEA compliance would almost certainly fall to the states, resulting in wide variation in how (or if) services are provided. This may leave families without the resources or legal protections they currently depend on. Some states may not have the budget to support special education services at the same level without federal funding.\"\nJacqueline Cooper, a Washington D.C.-based attorney who also holds a special education certification, said she has already seen some states \"not providing equitable and sufficient education because of a lack of resources, staffing and content development.\" She worries about that dynamic if federal oversight is removed.\n\"I believe in the arena of education we need federal standards that are implemented at the state level. Without the guidance and supervision of a federal agency, many states will not provide support to those who are in need of support,\" Cooper said.\nThat could extend to civil rights law and which federal agency takes the lead in those in the education realm. Trump and his acolytes could also focus on high-profile fights over transgender rights related to high school sports and school restrooms.\nRiccards said special education parents have proven effective voices for education at the state and local levels and could bring that energy if Congress goes down that path.\nHe sees Linda McMahon \u2014 Trump's pick for education secretary \u2014 championing literacy and vocational education programs and giving more education power and flexibility to states and localities. Wallerstein said that is something states have wanted for years.\nMcMahon served as small business administrator in Trump's first administration. McMahon and her husband, Vince McMahon, both of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) fame and fortune, contributed more than $21 million to Trump's 2024 efforts, according to campaign finance filings.\nRobert Kesten, executive director of Stonewall National Museum Archives and Library in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, expects the incoming administration and Trump's backers in Congress to step up efforts to promote private and charter school vouchers and tax credits and other alternatives to public schools. Conservative lawmakers and policy groups have been pushing for that in various states.\n\"This is now moving to a steroid version of that,\" Kesten said.\nWhile conservatives want to see less federal impacts on the education system and more control by local communities and parents, Kesten worries about right-wing agendas being emboldened, increasing their efforts related to curricula, textbook content and school library offerings.\n\"Those are things we should be alarmed about,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Budget discussions kicked off at Talbot Board of Ed work session\n\n December 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 619\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The Talbot Board of Education was presented with preliminary budget considerations during a Monday work session as planning for the fiscal year 2026 budget is underway.Talbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones outlined the priorities her team is focusing on. Those priorities include achieving academic equity in math, fostering an engaging environment for students and staff, and recruiting and retaining staff members.\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi said those areas were determined as priorities during a board retreat last year.\n\"When the dust all ended, we said that these were the three priorities that we wanted to move forward with,\" Pepukayi said. \" \u2026 And then most recently, we've talked about special education being a focus for us as well.\"\nDuring the meeting, Jones provided an overview of the budget process and how the state's expansive 10-year education funding initiative, The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, allocates money on a per-student basis.\n\"Every student in our system grades (K-12) qualifies for a base amount, and that's called our foundation funding,\" Jones said. \"That's how we keep our lights on. That's how we have insurance.\"\nThen, depending on student classifications in other categories, such as multilingual learners and special education, more money is allocated to a school. Each school receives different funding based on their enrollment statistics, Jones said.\nShe added that the expectation from the state is that \"at least 75%\" of the money given toward a certain school is \"spent directly at that school.\" Costs related to human resources, finance and transportation often aren't school-specific.\nAccording to Jones, the district needs to \"make some shifts\" in two programs \u2014 compensatory education and multilingual learners \u2014 in order to comply with Blueprint requirements. No district in the state is fully compliant at this time, she noted, but the Blueprint Accountability & Implementation Board is seeking progress.\n\"We're just not spending enough money on those areas to meet criteria,\" Jones said.\nPepukayi said the strict requirements affect funding for smaller schools, a topic that's come up in her discussions with fellow superintendents on the Eastern Shore.\n\"The foundation funding is insufficient to do all that we need to do, particularly for the smaller schools, the districts that have smaller schools,\" she said. \" \u2026 It's compliance-driven and rigidness for our budgeting versus giving us the flexibility to make those decisions and differentiate ourselves.\"\nSchools and departments in the district submit budgets every year, along with providing a list of requested positions. Position requests include teachers, coaches, English second language professionals, special education staff and social workers.\n\"We're not at the level where we were at last year,\" Jones added.\nBoard President Emily Jackson brought up whether or not the district could revisit previous hopes to hire someone for a grants manager position since managing grants is a significant stress on the finance department.\nJones said it's \"burdensome\" to track all of the necessary results and data from grants.\n\"You have to have a really detailed knowledge of the public education landscape to be able to write those grants, I would say,\" Jones said. \"And that was our challenge.\"\nHowever, Jones was optimistic on the prospect that a grants manager could eventually help Talbot County Public Schools bring in more revenue.\n\"Hiring a grant person might make sense financially,\" she said. \"They might at least be able to pay for themselves, and then hopefully generate some revenue in other ways.\"\nThe Talbot County Board of Education will meet with the Talbot County Council on Jan. 7 to discuss a proposed budget. The proposed budget will first be brought to the board at a Jan. 13 work session, and then on Jan. 15 for first reader.\nAs of now, a public hearing on the budget is scheduled for Feb. 10, with a potential board vote slated for Feb. 12. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "St. Michaels' Classic Motor Museum donation campaign for new property\n\n December 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 516\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST MICHAELS \u2014 The Classic Motor Museum is seeking to grow its space on Talbot Street, aiming to complete the purchase of an extension by Jan. 17.With about $300,000 left to raise of their $1.2 million goal, volunteers and members of the museum are making last efforts to raise enough donations to make it happen.\nThe Classic Motor Museum is a nonprofit organization dedicated to appreciating, preserving and showcasing America's heritage of automotive innovation and adaptation.\nThe extension would be used to provide hands-on experiences for students of the organization's Automotive Technician Apprenticeship Program. This three-year program began in 2022. It comprises 2,000 hours annually of on-the-job training in a local facility with one-on-one mentorship and 160 hours of classroom instruction per year through online resources.\nApprentices are commissioned by an automotive repair and maintenance shop for the program. Additionally, they are given a $4,500 stipend for tools after three months of training.\nGina Verhalen, administrator of the Classic Motor Museum, said so far the Drive Forward Capital Campaign to purchase the 906 S. Talbot St. property has gathered over $900,000 in donations.\n\"It just shows the incredible support that we have from not just the community,\" Verhalen said. \"We have a number of donors, and we don't even recognize their names, so we know that the support goes well beyond just St. Michaels.\"\nVerhalen said nationwide there has been an active decline in the number of new automotive technicians. According to the TechForce Foundation, an organization providing sholarships and other support to students in tech fields, the automotive industry needs 258,000 new automotive technicians every year, yet only 48,000 are graduated.\nVerhalen said the museum's apprenticeship program is providing people with the opportunity to explore new career avenues and learn from experienced instructors.\nJim McCrea, an instructor for the program, said prior to retirement he had worked 48 years in the automotive industry. For McCrea, the development of new property would provide valuable opportunities for the students and also for the town.\nThe renovation plans for the property would include renovating the building back to a '50s style gas station while providing classroom learning inside. McCrea said currently the property is a bit of an eyesore, but if the museum is able to purchase and renovate the property it could be a classic part of the town.\n\"The real reason we wanted to get this (property) is so we could have more of a hands-on place for them. It's more realistic as far as working in a shop,\" McCrea said.\nMichael Landolo, director of education at the museum, said those living on the Eastern Shore should feel invested in the outcome of the new generation and have a responsibility to make sure the area has a pathway for young people to find good jobs in their hometowns.\n\"It's really investing in the future, and it's allowing the young men and women who may not have a pathway to college, may not even have an interest in it, but they still want to have a job where they use their brains, they use their hands and they can be someone who's really contributing to society,\" Landolo said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's monotonous, tedious, and humbling, but also stimulating, uplifting, and gratifying. Kaeo and Carstan have moved through everything that it is, and they've come out of the other end of it in good working order, perfectly capable, and with plenty of enthusiasm to keep on going.\"\nClarke is a native of Annapolis. His father runs the Oak Harbor Marina in Pasadena, Maryland and he was working there in 2021, learning the basics of maintenance and rigging on modern metal and fiberglass vessels, when he applied for the apprenticeship in CBMM's Shipyard to learn the trade of wooden boat building.\n\"In my interview, I said that I'm much better at moving boats than building them,\" Clarke said. \"I still don't consider myself an expert at woodworking or boat building, but I can tell you that I know a whole lot more now than I did when I got here.\"\nHe's also worked on the Maryland Dove build and the refit of Chesapeake Bay buyboat Winnie Estelle.\n\"It's an honor to be part of Dove's story,\" Clarke said. \"There are a couple portions of that boat I can point at and say, 'Yeah, I did that.'\"\nGage is from Oregon and made the cross-country move to CBMM in August 2022 with a design degree and experience working as a carpenter but little familiarity with boats.\n\"I would say the community is a big part of why I was able to succeed here,\" Gage said. \"All of the people here are very helpful, and they've created an atmosphere where it's OK to take your time and really learn.\nGage has spent most of his time at CBMM focused on helping to maintain its floating fleet. One of the highlights was getting the historic skipjack Rosie Parks fit for sailing for the first time in several years, which included replacing sections of the sheer clamp, side planking, and deck boards, CBMM said in an announcement.\nGage sailed on Rosie Parks this fall to the skipjack race in Cambridge and Sultana Downrigging Festival.\n\"After all that, I feel confident in saying Rosie is probably the best-looking skipjack on the Bay right now,\" Gage said. \"I had a big part in that, so that's a good feeling.\"\nThe pair logged the requisite 4,000 hours of hands-on experience, plus additional skill development training, under the direction of CBMM's staff.\nAfter words from program supporter and CBMM Board Emeritus Tom Seip, Hilgartner, and Shipwright Educator Steve Garrand, the offered his congratulations to the new graduates of a program that is unique in its scope and ambition, not just across the state but nationally.\n\"This is truly a standalone program,\" said Maryland Department of Labor's Director of Apprenticeship & Training Chris MacLarion. \"This is the only registered one that I can find on the books anywhere in the country left that's doing this through the state or federal government, that's registering apprentices, training them, and graduating them to not only not lose the knowledge and the skills but to carry it down to the next generation.\"\nThat impressed Clarke.\n\"That was really cool to hear,\" Clarke said. \"I didn't know we were such rare birds in this program, but I'm happy to have been one.\"\nCBMM's Shipwright Apprentice Program will add two more Shipwright Apprentices in the new year.

    "content": "Talbot leaders optimistic about improvements at Easton Middle, across TCPS\n\n December 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 697\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 During its monthly meeting, the Talbot County Board of Education was provided with a detailed look into the Maryland School Report Card results, including where improvements may be needed.Released by the Maryland Department of Education earlier this month, the report card awards schools points based on performance in four categories: academic achievement, academic progress, English language arts proficiency progress, and school quality and student success.\nSt. Michaels Elementary School rose from three stars in 2023 to four stars this year, while White Marsh Elementary School \u2014 which remained steady at four stars \u2014 produced significant gains in test scores and percentile ranks.\nHelga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, focused her presentation on Easton Middle School, which was the district's only school to have a year-to-year drop in its star rating.\nShe explained what caused the school's rating to drop from three stars to two stars and pinpointed improvements that weren't reflected in the report card.\n\"Given the number of factors that make up this star rating and the complexity of the formulas, I wanted to share with you a deeper dive into what impacted the decrease in stars for Easton Middle School so we all have a better understanding of what's happening,\" Einhorn said.\nEinhorn noted that there were small increases in academic achievement and academic progress at Easton Middle. \"It was not notable in the MSDE reporting because they truncate the values for their calculations,\" she said.\nThe state report did show an increase in points scored for English proficiency. That and the small gains in the other categories show the school's progress, Einhorn says.\n\"The steps that (Principal Kelly Murdoch) and her school are putting in place at Easton Middle are having an impact in improving outcomes for students,\" Einhorn said, \"even though it doesn't show up in that calculation for the star rating.\"\nEaston Middle's score for school quality and student success dropped from 19.5 points in 2023 to 17.1 points in 2024, which largely caused the star rating drop. Einhorn said that mostly stemmed from the rate of chronically absent students, the \"largest single measure that impacts the star rating of a school.\"\nA common misconception is that only unexcused absences count toward considering a student chronically absent. That is not the case, Einhorn said, emphasizing that both excused and unexcused absences count in the tracking for whether a student is chronically absent or not according to the state.\n\"(Do) we have some investigation going on into what is causing that so it's not carried over into the high school?\" Board Member Karla Wieland-Cherry asked.\nEinhorn said the district has \"several checkpoints\" in place and is working with teachers, social workers and administrators to reduce chronic absenteeism.\nBoard Vice President Amy Dodson expressed optimism about the work being done to improve student achievement at Easton Middle.\n\"I've spoken to some parents of students at Easton Middle, and they give glowing reports of what they're doing over there,\" Dodson said. \"And some of our neighboring counties did not fare so well with the star system. So keep up the work, there's still plenty of work to do.\"\n\"I see every day the work that Easton Middle School is doing, so to have this be the measure of your work is really hard,\" responded Einhorn. \"I appreciate your recognition of what's happening there and the effort they're putting in.\"\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the district is constantly assessing school performance and data internally in order to \"(celebrate) the growth that we're seeing at Easton Middle School and all of our schools.\"\n\"We take our own internal approach, and we just don't wait for the stars to come out every one time a year, or the (Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program test scores) to come out one time a year,\" Pepukayi said.\nEinhorn said while she didn't want to \"suggest that we should be happy with a two-star rating,\" she hoped the detailed breakdown provided context around how Easton Middle is improving.\n\"I know that with time (and) support from this board that Easton Middle School will continue to see gains in their school improvement efforts,\" Einhorn said. \"I'm really proud of their innovation and persistence in looking at ways to improve outcomes for the students they serve.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It included two days off in the second week of March 2026 for students and a five-day spring break for students from April 2 to April 6, 2026.\n\"The thinking of the committee was to put some days off in March, and then to do the April holiday,\" Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, said. \"Dividing the break would also minimize the impact on our students who rely on the support of our schools for their meal support.\"\nBoard President Emily Jackson, who serves on the calendar committee, expressed confusion with the draft calendar that Einhorn presented.\n\"It was a surprisingly contentious group, with a huge set of ideas that ran the gamut,\" Jackson said of the committee. \"So what I am seeing presented today, to me, does not accurately reflect what I took away from the discussions that were had.\"\nJackson said she was expecting multiple draft calendars, not just one. She added that past surveys have indicated there are strong opinions on extending spring break and having \"time for teachers in their classrooms without students.\"\n\"Personally, I come back to wanting to give our community what they're asking for,\" Jackson said. \"So I'm looking for a calendar that has an actual spring break on it.\"\nBoard Member Deborah Bridges said she liked the two days off in March.\n\"I think the March break is wonderful from a mental health standpoint, because March is long, dreary,\" Bridges said. \"And everybody \u2014 kids, parents and teachers \u2014 need a little break, and I think that's a really good thing to do.\"\nBoard Member Dyshekia Strawberry raised concerns that the shorter spring break could increase chronic absenteeism in April. Vice President Amy Dodson said while the draft calendar \"looks good,\" an off day in March could possibly be moved to extend spring break.\nJackson also brought up the possibility of staggered starts for students in \"transition\" grades that are starting at new schools. Einhorn said that she is waiting on direction from the state to understand how other districts do staggered starts while still complying with 180-day requirements.\nFeedback from Wednesday's meeting will be taken back to the calendar committee and discussed before a draft calendar is presented for second reader at the board's January meeting.\nEinhorn said it'd be possible for the committee to look at keeping the two off days in March, as well as extending spring break, by moving the last day of school back.\nJackson vouched for \"consistent breaks\" in order to accommodate student needs surrounding mental health, travel needs, college tours and more.\n\"There are ways to put this together that do make sense and don't look like this,\" the board president said.\n\"I think we have to put everything out on the table because we have constraints,\" Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said. \"We can't have it both ways.\n\"And while I know we want extra days off, I hear loud and clear from parents (about) child care. But we also want to balance, because I also hear from staff, more planning time. We just have to find out, what is that balance?\" \n\n Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

A $500,000 grant was given to the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation, which is funding STEM centers at 10 different schools in Maryland, including Lockerman.\nCaroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said the foundation's contribution is bringing unique experiences to Lockerman students.\n\"There's no way that this level of resource and these tools would be able to get in the hands of our middle school kids if it wasn't for your partnership and Ripken Foundation's work,\" Simmons said.\nOn Tuesday, students showed off the new tools and gadgets that were funded by the grant, such as a 3D printer, coding robots and electronic kits. In the school cafeteria, two students flew drones.\nSixth grader Gracie Spiering showed off her knowledge of how to make backpack security alarms or model cars using littleBits Electronic kits. She knew how to order the kit's pieces and wires, and learned how the coding worked.\n\"It's been so much fun to have in class,\" Spiering said. \"Everybody's been so ready to come into that class.\"\nMeanwhile, many students have been utilizing the 3D printers to make ornaments for the holidays. Seventh grader Madison Watson said it's been a smooth learning process thanks to the help of her teachers.\n\"It's pretty fun to have them just at any time we really want them to be here,\" Watson said.\nLockerman Middle School Principal Jeannine Necessary said students love learning how to use the new materials. Staff members were trained and encouraged to integrate the STEM tools into everyday learning, the principal said.\nDuring the ribbon-cutting, University of Maryland Shore Regional Health President and CEO Ken Kozel said the healthcare system appreciates students involved in STEM because the students are \"highly motivated and educated.\"\n\"We're here to promote STEM because it's such an important part of the healthcare system,\" Kozel said. \"We're local, we're small, we're a community hospital system, but we need our community to help support our workforce needs.\"\nWith a handful of students excited to show off the new technology on Tuesday, Simmons reflected on how much the grant means to the Denton middle school, given the district's financial challenges.\n\"About 60 to 65 percent of our students qualify for free and reduced meals, which puts a little bit different lens on the opportunities that our kids have to access things,\" Simmons said. \"It also puts a lens on the opportunity the school system has funding-wise to be able to provide those avenues.\n\"We are thrilled that we were selected by you guys, in partnership with the Ripken Foundation, to be able to provide opportunity and access that we could've never funded for our students.\" \n\n Copyright 2024",

    "content": "Beloved bus driver 'Mrs. Dea' brings holiday cheer to young passengers\n\n December 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lilly Howard lhoward@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1200\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CECIL COUNTY \u2014 Nedean Crawford, more commonly known as Mrs. Dea, is much more than a bus driver to the students she drives to and from school each day, where she makes a lasting impression on their lives through her caring nature and holiday cheer.\"When they're on my bus, they're my kids,\" Mrs. Dea said. \"It's like you're a teacher, you're a nurse, you're a psychiatrist, you know, you're a mother, you're a counselor, you're all of those things, just not a school bus driver.\"\nOver her 28 years driving with Marshall Bus Company, during which she has averaged around 61 students per semester, Mrs. Dea has made an impact on many lives as a positive female role model.\nShe greets each and every student entering and leaving the bus each morning and afternoon, and spends extra time getting to know them.\n\"A little bit of 'hello,' or a little hug or something like that, really makes that child's day,\" Mrs. Dea said. \"And if I see it on their face, that they're not right, we get to the school a little bit early and I say, 'Come on, come and talk to Mrs. Dea. What's going on? Tell me your story.'\"\nHer route includes Elk Neck Elementary, North East High School and their Twilight program for students who need extra help.\nMany of the middle school students who grew up riding her bus look forward to reuniting with her in high school.\n\"My oldest is now a big sixth grader and says 'I miss Mrs. Dea' because her new bus driver, even though he's nice and all, is just not the same,\" one parent, Todd Hudson, said.\nThe feeling is mutual.\n\"It's the kids that keep coming me back,\" Mrs. Dea said. \"Once they go into middle school for three years, six to eight. I don't see them, but I get them back in ninth grade, and it's such a joy to see how much they've grown since\u2026it's just amazing. I'm 61 years old, and it's just, oh, it really gets to you\u2026on my elementary run, my kids just love me, hug me every day, and it makes my day. And that's what has me coming back day after day after day.\"\nAccording to Mrs. Dea, retirement is not a decision that's up to her.\n\"I can't retire, because I get them back in high school and the parents say that you can't retire until my child graduates,\" Mrs. Dea said.\nAll four of Ashley Culley-Meekin's children have experienced riding with Mrs. Dea.\n\"My son, who's in kindergarten this year, calls her the magic school bus driver,\" Culley-Meekins said, adding that Mrs. Dea cares about the children and is always decorating her school bus and dressing up for each and every holiday.\nThe interior roof of Mrs. Dea's bus 77 is currently embellished in battery powered string lights with festive colors for the holidays. She hung garland with ornaments above the windows and along the side of the bus as well.\nMrs. Dea started this tradition five years ago when she found out some of her students didn't have a Christmas tree at home.\n\"So I decorated the bus like it was a Christmas tree so that they could feel and see what a Christmas tree would be like, other than, you know, really not having the green branches, but just giving them an idea with the lights and the garland. And it clicked, so I continued to do it every year,\" Mrs. Dea said.\nWhen those students came home telling their parents about the Christmas decorations in the bus, their mom had to see for herself, and peeked inside in awe when picking her kids up from the bus stop one day.\nIn addition to the lights, Mrs. Dea puts on the radio and the students sing along when holiday favorites come on the airwaves, like \"Rudolph.\" Mrs. Dea always makes the students on the bus feel special.\n\"If they have a bad day at school and they get on Mrs. Dea's bus, they're always happier when they get home\u2026even the little things, like she'll give them Halloween goodie bags and Christmas goodie bags, just to brighten their day,\" one parent with four children who have ridden on bus 77, Heidi Smith said.\nBut more than the jolly songs and goodie bags, Mrs. Dea watches out for every child that comes through her bus doors.\n\"The most important thing besides all that, is her caring for not only my kids, but a bus full\u2026She treats them like they're her own [children]. She's always aware of her bus at all times,\" Culley-Meekins said.\nSmith's son RJ is diabetic and Mrs. Dea carries Smarties candy and bags of chips in case his blood sugar drops on the bus. This happened recently, and when RJ's glucose monitor beeped indicating low blood sugar, Mrs. Dea safely pulled over to ensure his levels evened out before she dropped him off.\n\"I feel safe with all of my kids on there. But like, RJ, being diabetic, I don't know that I would trust another bus driver,\" Smith said, adding that Mrs. Dea always checks in with RJ to ensure his blood sugar levels are steady, and carries snacks just in case.\nShe is attentive to every child on the bus.\n\"There have been times where she has stopped the bus in front of my house for my kids to get off the bus, and she's quickly closed the doors because a car has ran through the bus,\" Culley-Meekins said.\nMrs. Dea mentioned that some of her biggest challenges come from outside of her magical bus, with crazy drivers, road conditions, and bad weather causing problems.\nLast year during a series of storms, a tree fell across Elk Neck Road, blocking Mrs. Dea's route and leaving the bus full of kids stranded, according to Hudson, a parent of students on this bus at the time who was called to move the tree.\n\"Mrs. Dea was playing games, keeping the kids occupied\u2026They were stranded for quite a while. So she was tap dancing, doing everything she could to keep the kids entertained, under control, and happy and not scared,\" Hudson said, adding that she even sent his children home with baked goods the following day as a thank you for clearing the road.\nMrs. Dea is always doing her best to make the children on her bus happy.\nBus driving is an often overlooked career choice and drivers sometimes face the stigma that they are uneducated, but Mrs. Dea emphasized that she could and has pursued other careers, but does this because she loves the kids.\n\"I don't have to drive a school bus. I choose to drive a school bus,\" Mrs. Dea said.\nBefore bus driving, Mrs. Dea graduated in the top third of her class at Glasgow High School in Delaware, went to college, and became a certified dental assistant until she had to have rotator cuff surgery five times and was unable to continue this work.\n\"I would never go back to the dental field, even if my arm got better\u2026I really enjoy driving the bus. The kids are fantastic,\" Mrs. Dea said. \"There's a lot of times as bus drivers, we get overwhelmed, and sometimes you don't feel appreciated. But I do have a good run\u2026I wouldn't give this run up for anything.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Miles River Yacht Club's Annual Angel Tree event brings holiday joy\n\n December 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Christmas \n \n 543\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS \u2014 The Miles River Yacht Club's annual Angel Tree event is bringing holiday cheer to the Eastern Shore.Through this time-honored tradition, members of the yacht club come together to celebrate and provide local children with presents and other essentials for the holidays.\nThis collaboration is in conjunction with the Head Start of Shore Up, a program focusing on children's social and educational development, and the event has recently roped the Benedictine School in an effort to grow the number of children who benefit from the Angel Tree program.\nNick Simpson, commodore at the Miles River Yacht Club, said this year they are providing gifts to over 30 local children. Simpson said this event has showcased the most generous characteristics of their members and the volunteer opportunities that the club promotes for all its members.\n\"Our mission statement has a lot about boating and doing things on the water, but part of the mission statement is also to give back to support the local community,\" Simpson said. \"The club donates a lot throughout the year. This is just kind of the culmination of it.\"\nSimpson said outside of this Angel Tree event, the club provides meals to those in need during Thanksgiving and members donate school supplies through the Community Center in St. Michaels for children. But the Angel Tree is by far the most anticipated event by members.\nAccording to Simpson, Head Start of Shore Up identifies children in need, then they work to get a list of toys that they want as well as clothing sizes for the children.\nThen a tree at the yacht club is decorated with cardboard or construction paper ornaments, and each ornament has two or three toys, as well as clothing items and sizes, requested by the children. Club members select an ornament, purchase the listed items, and return them to the club to be distributed to the children.\nSimpson said members will often race to obtain these ornaments.\nJackie Tate, a volunteer at Head Start of St. Michaels, said the children picked for the Angel Tree range from ages 2 to 4. Tate said the program has been going on for well over a decade and she has loved the joy brought to families.\n\"That's why I continue to do it, because you never know what the parents are going through because they don't tell you and if I can help a family that's in need, do this for them. My heart is satisfied,\" she said.\nTate said parents will often not know when their child is picked to be part of the Angel Tree, and she recalls a time about 10 years ago when she called a mother and told her that her child had been picked for the program and she needed to come down and pick up the gifts bought for her.\nWhen the mother came to the classroom, she was overwhelmed with gratitude and began to cry.\n\"(The mother) said, 'Miss Tate, I thank you so much because I didn't know what I was going to do for Christmas for my child, because I've been laid off from my job.' And that touched my heart to know that we could, just as a yacht club, help these children and these families, because you don't know what they're going through,\" Tate said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This application is due in March, she said.\nStudents will be selected for enrollment via lottery, with all county students eligible to attend, she said.\nOptions for school facilities are still being explored with the hopes to mirror Frederick County and Anne Arundel counties' business park locations, Scott said.\n\"It would be a real feather in the cap of Queen Anne's County to have the first one on the Eastern Shore,\" Scott said.\nA public meeting about QACCS welcomes the community to learn more Jan. 25, 2025 at 10 a.m. at Kent Island Fire Department, 1610 Main Street in Chester.\nMore information including a petition of support can be found at QueenAnnesCCS.com and its Facebook page. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Board of Public Works approved funding for the study at its Dec. 4 meeting.\n\"This issue is exacerbated for undocumented students or citizen children of undocumented parents,\" Lierman said at that meeting.\nThe current method of tabulating poverty \"really penalizes\" schools with large numbers of immigrant students, Lierman said.\nThe state currently uses proxy measures, such as eligibility for national programs like Medicaid and SNAP, to calculate aid for public schools, according to the proposal for funds from the Department of General Services.\nAccording to the Governor's Office for Children, an accurate count of students in poverty is important to ensure that they get adequate resources. The office also told CNS that the \"Blueprint for Maryland's Future created several new school funding streams that rely on counts of low-income students.\"\nSchools currently rely on applications for the free and reduced meals program and enrollment in social programs like Medicaid as methods of calculating student poverty. According to the Governor's Office for Children, \"not all low income families participate in these programs.\"\nThe office also said that \"districts that provide free school meals to all students under the federal community eligibility program do not collect that data.\"\nIn the case of immigrant families, some may not qualify or, as the office told CNS, may be hesitant to enroll and reveal their citizenship status.\nOther data the state might rely upon is out of date. According to Lierman, the Maryland State Department of Education recently proposed using data from 2013 to calculate school poverty in Baltimore City. Lierman said that many public schools have been shuttered in the city since that data was collected.\n\"As a Baltimore City Public School mom,\" Lierman said, \"I've got a lot of strong feelings about this.\"\nThe board approved the DGS request for $48,000 monthly for \"modeling, analysis and providing a presentation on findings.\"\nAccording to the Office for Children, a recommendation based on the results of the study will be made to the Maryland General Assembly by Dec. 1, 2025. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland stories: This reading club is going to the dogs\n\n December 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 628\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Those who might get nervous reading in front of a group might be better suited reading for those with four legs, a shell, big floppy ears or a tail.That's just one of the ideas behind Southern Maryland-based Pets on Wheels, which recently stopped at the Leonardtown Library.\n\"It improves confidence, reading skills and literacy,\" said Southern Maryland Pets on Wheels Coordinator Sharon Stapf. \"Pets don't care if you get a word wrong. They're non-judgmental.\"\nStapf said the program can even benefit adults learning a second language.\n\"It gives the kids confidence when maybe they wouldn't want to read to a big group, but they'll read to a really cute dog,\" Brittany Haun of Leonardtown said as she watched her daughter, Charlotte, pet a large brown dog. \"I think it's great and if they had more of these events, I would recommend people coming to them.\"\n\"My son loves dogs and all kinds of animals,\" Cassondra West of Mechanicsville said. \"It just seems like a calming effect.\nBut reading is not the only benefit of the program, which Stapf said started out of Johns Hopkins to see if pets could help homebound patients feel less lonely.\n\"Whether it's children or adults, animals are the one thing that people miss, whether it be in the military or in existed living and maybe they've outlived their pets,\" Stapf said. \"It is a family member and they miss that contact. They may not remember what they had for lunch, but they can tell me the name of every animal that came through that facility for the entire week before I visit.\"\nJoshua Crosley of Mechanicsville can relate. The Panera Bread manager lost his beloved 11-year-old Corgi \"Izzy\" in a tragic accident in 2022.\n\"We had a baby [several months ago], so it's not a good time to find a new family member, but when given the opportunity, trust me I'll take an animal,\" said Crosley, who now has a young son. \"This gives me an opportunity, at least a little bit, to come down for this and get some solace. [My daughter Elliot] misses Izzy as well and she'd love to have a dog, so this is kind of a shared experience.\"\nStapf also relayed a story about an individual at Naval Air Station Patuxent River who was \"standoffish toward dogs, but when he found out we had a giant tortoise he came alive. His home was Hawaii and he had a pet tortoise.\"\nShe also told how an individual at Charlotte Hall Veterans Home had trouble getting words out, but following a visit with a dog it was discovered that if he had two hands on the animal it connected something that allowed him to speak.\n\"It sparked something,\" Stapf said. \"It was phenomenal. It gave me chills all the way down to my toes.\"\nTracey Quade of Drayden recalled an incident at Chopticon High School in which a girl dressed all in black reached over and hugged the dog Loki Sandstorm for a good 15 minutes, all the while crying.\n\"Then she stood up, wiped her tears and walked away and never said a word to me,\" Quade said. \"And [Loki] looked at me and honest to God I think he smiled. That kid needed something and he gave it to her.\"\nVolunteers wanting to work with the organization must have pets that meet several qualifications \u2014 the \"canine good citizenship test,\" Stapf calls it \u2014 in which they must be good around other animals, able to be touched \"nose to toes,\" and not be disturbed by loud noises, staring or wheelchairs.\n\"I wanted to serve the community and I love dogs,\" Quade, who is retired from the federal government, said. \"Personally I see the benefits for myself, for the dog and for the community.\"\nFor more information on Pets On Wheels, go to www.petsonwheels.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-01-02",

    "content": "Chesapeake College works to become Hispanic-Serving Institution\n\n January 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado valvarado@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 950\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Zulema Delacruz Martinez, a 2024 graduate of Chesapeake College, was described by the school's faculty as an achievement.During her time at Chesapeake College, she was a founder of the Hispanic/Latino Student Union, the chair of the annual Unity Fest and a mentor for area high school students with TRiO's Upward Bound summer program.\n\"She's the type of person that (Chesapeake College) would love to see her success repeated in many more,\" said Lorelly Solano, director at the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center.\nDelacruz Martinez credited support programs like TRiO, a federal student services program, for her own college success. She said having TRiO provided her opportunities for academic success and to better understand financial resources for education. It is programs such as TRiO that motivated her to lead in the creation of the Hispanic/Latino Student Union.\n\"In my mind, when I founded (Hispanic/Latino Student Union), it's more like, 'How can I help others? What kind of resources can I create, or kind of resources can become available, so that way the students coming after me, who come from similar backgrounds, they don't have to worry as much, and they can focus more on being students, focus on being essentially teenagers and young adults enjoying college life and creating connections?'\" Delacruz Martinez said.\nThe student union hosts community nights to assist Latino community members who are having trouble filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, commonly called FAFSA.\nThis form assists current and prospective college students to determine their eligibility for student financial aid. The Hispanic/Latino Student Union has been leading Chesapeake College's Latino student recruitment by hosting events catered to potential students.\nDelacruz Martinez said that more than 90% of attendees of FAFSA Nights applied to Chesapeake College. She assisted families from all age groups, including grandparents with limited knowledge of the internet.\nChesapeake College, a public two-year regional community college in Wye Mills, is going through changes to address the growing Hispanic population.\nAccording to Marcie Alvarado Molloy, director of public information at Chesapeake College, over the last decade the Hispanic population at the school has increased by more than 64% and is expected to continue to grow.\nThe college has made an effort to translate all pamphlets and documents for Spanish speaking families and students. Additionally, the school is trying to increase the number of Spanish-speaking staff, especially in key offices like financial aid. The college has made efforts to collaborate with family liaisons from Talbot County Public Schools and has attended various community events to increase the school's presence and visibility.\nClifford Coppersmith, president of Chesapeake College, said the college is on its way to becoming a Hispanic-Serving Institution. A Hispanic-Serving Institution is defined by the U.S. Department of Education as an eligible institution with an undergraduate enrollment that is at least 25% Hispanic.\nAccording to the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, in 2023 there were about 600 Hispanic-Serving Institutions in the United States. The U.S. Department of Education offers Hispanic-Serving Institutions 64 grants through the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institution program, and in 2023 the Biden-Harris Administration announced it would award more than $40 million to support Hispanic/Latino students.\nCoppersmith said more and more Hispanic students are transferring from Chesapeake College to four-year colleges every year.\n\"So with our Hispanic population, up until probably fairly recently, the predominant interest has been short-term non-credit, but more and more we are seeing Hispanic students getting into transfer education,\" Coppersmith said. \"They intend to go in and get bachelor's degrees.\"\nGENERATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTSolano said she appreciates the collaboration Chesapeake College does with schools and nonprofits to help accomplish the academic dreams of the Hispanic community.\n\"When our society is so polarized, and you also hear a lot of negative rhetoric about immigrants, I think it is so important for for these kids and for their families to actually demonstrate to themselves and to others that that they actually can achieve their dreams, that they can show this very dignified side of of their dreams, because, quite frankly, this is about generational achievement,\" Solano said.\nCollege degrees have generational impacts on families. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' Center for Household Financial Stability, families with at least two generations of college graduates have median income and wealth that are higher than those of families where fewer generations have college degrees. Hispanic families across the county have been enrolling their children in record numbers over the past two decades, according to the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.\nIn 2023, Chesapeake College welcomed its class with Hispanic students making up the largest minority student demographic at more than 43% of the college's more than 1,395 minority students.\nDuring this year's graduation Delacruz Martinez was awarded the John T. Harrison Award. This award is given each year to a student who has demonstrated the highest academic performance, leadership and overall contributions to the college and the community.\nMilton Nagel, vice chair of the Chesapeake College Board of Trustees, presented the award to Delacruz Martinez and gave her praise for her commitment to Hispanic and Latino students within the region who are interested in college but may be intimidated by the academic process.\nDelacruz Martinez, said she is happy to see schools throughout the Eastern Shore adapting to the growing Latino population through different programs and the efforts to hire diverse faculty and staff. According to Delacruz Martinez, these efforts are not going unnoticed.\n\"Hispanic Latino students are resilient. We are very, very, very hardworking,\" Delacruz Martinez said. \"We will put in the effort if given the chance. But this issue is that sometimes we aren't given that chance. We have to focus on other difficult situations we are placed in, within our own homes, within their own communities. So invest in us, and we will certainly put in the effort.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

In order to celebrate the foundation's accomplishments and to share the upcoming year's goals, the foundation held a gala/luncheon for its supporters on Dec. 14.During the foundation's annual fundraiser event, over a 100 people gathered together to participate in a silent auction and honor scholarship recipients, their experiences and their accomplishments.\nKeasha Haythe, founder of Foundation of HOPE, said the fundraiser provides the opportunity for donors and supporters of the organization to see the progress made so far through presentations and speakers, including past students and scholarship recipients.\n\"It was really good to have people in the room to hear about where we've been, where we're going, what our goals and our priorities are to expand the program to not only have more girls participate, but also to serve the community,\" Haythe said.\nHaythe said speakers for the event included 2024 scholarship recipients Kaleigh Hammond and Michaela Gibson. Gibson, a student at John Hopkins, and Hammond, a student at Chesapeake College, shared their experiences with the program and how the foundation helped them achieve their goals.\nHaythe said they were a part of the second cohort of the program, which offers after-school classes to sixth-grade girls.\nHaythe said the Foundation of HOPE program was established in 2018 with the goal to teach middle school girls how to be viable contributors to the future workforce. The program covers topics including addressing low self-esteem, bullying, social media, workforce development, and economic and community development.\nHaythe said over the years the program has grown to cater to more girls in the community. According to Haythe, the program hopes to grow to include 30 students. Additionally, they hope to start pre construction work for a foundation headquarters around quarter two of 2025.\nAccording to Haythe, the foundation received $150,000 from the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development in December. The foundation has launched the capital campaign to the public.\nHaythe said supporters can make donations to the foundation in many ways, but she encourages the public to show their appreciation for women or girls in their lives by honoring them with a Rose of Hope. A Rose of Hope is a donation made in someone else's honor to help support the foundation's Economic Development and Empowerment program. Names of those honored are shared on the foundation's website and listed at the Annual Gala Program.\nHaythe said she is proud of the opportunity to help girls in the program. She shared that Gibson wanted to study marine biology in sixth grade and now she is studying at John Hopkins. For Haythe, continuing to foster that growth and belief in young girls is what she enjoys.\n\"I think looking over the last year, I've been most proud of how the girls who have completed the program have blossomed into young women,\" Haythe said. \"How they are following their dreams. I mean, these dreams that they had in sixth grade, they're manifesting for them\u2026 these young ladies are truly understanding who they are, and they're developing in the program, and after completing the program, into nice young women that are going after their dreams.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Biden, Jr. School of Public Policy & Administration and Biden Institute,\" UD spokesman Christopher Vito said.\nThe Biden Institute was created after Biden left the vice presidency in 2017, and it is currently located in the old Blue and Gold Club on Kent Way. Chaired by the president's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, the Biden Institute hosts events, brings prominent speakers to campus and focuses on developing domestic public policy.\nUD's highly ranked School of Public Policy & Administration, which was renamed for Biden in 2018, offers undergraduate and graduate programs in leadership, public administration, public policy, public health, disaster management and related fields. It is currently headquartered in Graham Hall on Academy Street.\nVito said the Biden Hall project is still in the early stages, and more details will be made public as the process moves forward.\n\"This modern facility will harness the latest technology to cultivate academic growth, interdisciplinary research collaborations, dialogue, and civil discourse, all of which are crucial to a flourishing democracy in the 21st century,\" he added.\nThe new building will be located on the main campus in Newark, but the specific location has yet to be determined.\n\"We are fundraising and planning with intent to enter design and programmatic planning in the 2025 calendar year,\" Vito said.\nFormer Gov. John Carney included $20 million in state funding for Biden Hall in his recommended capital budget, which he released just one day before resigning to be sworn in as mayor of Wilmington. The budget will be debated and voted on by the state legislature in June.\n\"We're very excited, because this is yet another opportunity for productive state investment through the University of Delaware, which will ultimately benefit the entire community,\" UD President Dennis Assanis said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Phone pouches improving student focus, discipline in Caroline, district says\n\n January 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 624\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n An experimental pilot program aimed at keeping students off their phones saw some success in its first semester being implemented at Caroline County Public Schools.Cellphone pouches created by the company Yondr were tested in both Caroline County middle schools last semester.\n\"We've been pleased with the outcome, Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"You see attentiveness much higher in classrooms, kids learning how to talk to each other, even in the cafeteria. It's been really cool to see at the middle schools.\"\nThe students carry locked pouches during the entire school day, with their phones inside but not accessible.\nEach student has their own pouch, which travels with them daily from home to school. Phone are locked into the pouches at the beginning of the school day and unlocked at the end using a magnetic device. If a student leaves the pouch at home, they put their phone in the school office for the day.\nEvery classroom in Caroline County comes equipped with a wired phone for use in case of an emergency, and teachers have been given a special pair of scissors to cut through cellphone pouches if needed.\nFor students with health needs, the schools offer special services allowing students to check their phones for medical purposes only.\nThere have been talks within the county of expanding cellphone pouches to ninth graders in coming years, but that determination has not yet been made, district officials said.\nIn determining whether the pouch program will be expected, the district still has to weigh the pros and cons, officials said. They hope that by the end of the school year they will have a solid understanding of the program's successes and shortcomings.\nSUCCESSES\nThe pouches have done a good job at keeping students off their phones during the school day, district officials said. But beyond that, the middle schools where the pouches have been implemented have seen some other benefits from the program.\nThe cellphone pouches help prevent cyber bullying in the school during the school day, they said. Students have needed less disciplinary intervention since the pouches were rolled out.\n\"We've seen about a 21% reduction in discipline incidents,\" Simmons said.\nSimmons also said teachers report that taking cellphones out of the picture has allowed them to better focus on instructing students.\n\"We ask a lot of our teachers, most of our class sizes average 20 to 20 plus students, so if you're asking them to improve reading or improve mathematics on top of being able to see if they're on cellphones it's a lot,\" Simmons said. \"With the pouches they don't have to be the cellphone police.\"\nAlthough schools don't yet have test scores back for last semester, the superintendent said pass rates have gone up with the cellphone pouches.\nDIFFICULTIES\nReception of the cellphone pouches has not been entierly positive among students and parents in the district, Simmons said.\nStudents have tried to tamper with or break into their pouches during the school day on multiple occasions.\n\"They're not indestructible, they're not the end all be all, but they are a great preventative tool to put in place,\" Simmons said. \"They're easy to tell if somebody's tampered with one, It's also easy to tell if a kid has their phone or has a phone out because they don't want their pouch or pouches to look empty.\"\nSome parents do not like the idea of the phone pouches because they prefer to have a direct line of communication with their child, Simmons said.\nStudents have not yet been polled on their feelings about the pouches, but the districts plans to weigh student attitudes toward the program in any future decisions made.\n\"I think overall, we're seeing a positive impact on the academics, on the social skills piece. If we asked kids if they'd rather have access to their devices, I'm sure they would,\" Simmons said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Talbot Board of Ed Sees Initial Budget Proposal",
    "date": "2025-01-15",
    "author": "Konner Metz",
    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed sees initial budget proposal\n\n January 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 720\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The Talbot Board of Education had its first look at the district's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 Monday.During a board work session Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones presented the draft budget, which totals $85.8 million in unrestricted dollars \u2014 an $8.6 million increase from fiscal year 2025, Jones noted.\nJones provided the year-to-year budget changes by looking at 12 different categories of expenditures. The areas in which increases were highest are fixed charges ($2.23 million increase), instructional salaries ($1.7 million increase) and other instructional costs ($1.47 million increase).\nJones added that while $9 million to $10 million in grants are expected next year, anticipated grant funding is more than $5 million less than last fiscal year. That drop in grant funding precipitated a portion of the rise in the requested unrestricted budget.\nIn Annapolis, it still remains to be seen how Maryland's expected $2.7 billion deficit is tackled and if legislative decisions will impact funding for The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education improvement and funding initiative.\nTalbot school leaders say budgeting will be a fluid process in the coming months as they keep an eye on state legislation and the Accountability & Implementation Board, an entity that ensures the state and county governments are correctly implementing Blueprint.\n\"There's one area where I did do a little bit of hedging our bets, on the conservative side,\" Jones said of the proposed budget. \"I don't think we'll know any of that until April or May. But as certain pieces of legislation gather steam and seem to gather support and seem likely, then I think we will work behind the scenes to figure out how we will address this if this comes to fruition.\"\nIn creating the draft budget, Jones and Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi emphasized that the district considered its top priorities: academic equity in math, an engaging environment for students and staff, recruitment and retention levels, and meeting Blueprint objectives.\nMonday's discussion included a breakdown of 33 proposed additional positions for the next fiscal year. The proposed budget includes a $3.6 million jump in salaries and wages.\n\"This list is whittled down, if you can believe it, from a longer list of wants and desires,\" Jones said. \"And it was very much informed by school administration. This is what they felt they needed in their buildings.\"\nADDITIONAL POSITIONSJones outlined the 33 additional positions that are in the requested budget. Six of those positions are for English for Speakers of Other Languages teachers, assistants or coaches.\nShe cited the district's need to serve its multilingual population, along with the state funding for multilingual learning, for adding the positions.\n\"Our (Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program) data \u2026 demonstrates that we do consistently underserve our multilingual students,\" Jones said. \"And so, we just need to provide more resources there.\"\nBoard of Education President Emily Jackson asked if those English for Speakers of Other Languages positions will be difficult to fill.\n\"Because I know we've had problems \u2014 specifically with ESOL in the past \u2014 finding people who are qualified and had a desire to do that,\" Jackson said. \"And that's a quarter of the positions we're looking for.\"\nZulieka Jarmon-Horsey, assistant superintendent of administrative services, systems and strategies, said it's a challenge both in Talbot County and statewide. She said recruitment and retention are key aspects.\n\"We have to definitely start promoting earlier and just doing the best that we can,\" Jarmon-Horsey said. \"And doing things that are unconventional, like our on-site career fair that's going to be happening here this week.\"\nOther requested positions in the budget include: an art teacher at Easton Middle, a high school math coach, a middle school reading coach, four special education positions at Easton Elementary and a special education teacher at Easton Middle.\nOne athletic trainer to serve Easton High School and St. Michaels Middle High School was also on the proposed list.\n\"I'm happy to see that at the top of the list,\" Jackson said of the athletic trainer role. \"I would be in favor of two \u2026 making sure that we have coverage for all of our athletic events. I know sports parents, they have eyes on that.\"\nThe draft budget will be discussed again at Wednesday's monthly Board of Education meeting before the board hosts its joint meeting with the Talbot County Council on Jan. 22. On Feb. 10, the board will host a public hearing on the budget. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed adds makeup day for snow; approves 2025-26 calendar\n\n January 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 580\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 During Wednesday's meeting, the Talbot County Board of Education added a day onto the end of this year's school calendar following last week's snowstorm.Talbot County Public Schools was closed Monday through Friday last week due to snow that blanketed the Mid-Shore. However, the 2024-2025 school calendar only had four inclement weather days built in, meaning an additional day was needed to comply with the state's 180-day requirement.\nHelga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, recommended that a day be added in June, moving the last day of school for students to Friday, June 13.\nThe last day for teachers would be Monday, June 16. Einhorn said that historically, most teachers complete mandated training that affords them with not having to come in on the last day.\nThe board unanimously passed the adjusted calendar for this year.\n2025-26 CALENDAROn Wednesday, the board also chose the district's calendar for the 2025-2026 school year.\nAt last month's meeting, Einhorn presented a draft calendar with two days off in March and a five-day spring break, which was the recommendation of the calendar committee. Board President Emily Jackson, however, expressed frustration there weren't multiple options posed.\nThis month, Einhorn returned with three draft calendars. The first was similar to what the board saw in December, with a four-day weekend in March and the shorter spring break. The second draft removed the off days in March and had an eight-day spring break.\nA third draft included both the March break and an eight-day spring break, pushing the last student day back to June 10, 2026.\nAll three drafts included the typical days off in November for Easton's Waterfowl Festival, as well as a winter break from Dec. 20, 2025, to Jan. 4, 2026.\n\"There is no calendar that we're going to create that is best for every single person,\" Jackson said.\nJackson said it's clear \u2014 based on previous polling and community input \u2014 that most families favor the extended spring break. Board Vice President Amy Dodson suggested the board move forward with the second or third calendars.\nBoard member Karla Wieland-Cherry said she preferred the first calendar with the shorter spring break.\n\"You're losing a lot of school time for eight days off for students,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"You're losing a lot of momentum. And plus you're concerned with providing day care. Not all employers are going to allow that. That's quite a long time to take off of work and find day care and so forth.\"\nShe added that not all families are looking for a longer spring break.\n\"My only concern is that if 59% of our students are at the poverty level, we're really talking about more of a smaller group who are really going to financially be able to afford an Easter holiday,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"\u2026 You really could possibly potentially be causing more hardship for something that's more an elitist type thing, quite honestly.\"\nJackson said while she agrees with Wieland-Cherry's point, she has \"to go with what the community is saying.\"\n\"We have asked again and again, and the majority of the respondents to any time we've asked this have said they like that spring break,\" Jackson said.\nFollowing board discussion, Jackson motioned for approval of the third calendar featuring two off days in March and five days for spring break. Her motion included an amendment to the calendar that the March days off serve as two of four inclement weather days for the district.\nBy a 6-1 vote, with only Wieland-Cherry voting against, the board approved the 2025-2026 school year calendar. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore had decided to postpone implementing the experimental Blueprint for Maryland in our schools, due to the $2.7 billion deficit accrued by the state of Maryland.The Blueprint has been described as follows:\n\"It has taken the focus of schools off teaching students the academic and content knowledge they need to be successful adults in our society and made them 'one stop shopping' for services like medical, dental, nutritional, social engineering and mental health. It has promoted the implementation of 'restorative discipline' which has created a generation of students who are out of control and violent since there are no consequences for bad behavior. It has drained our schools of teachers as they flee to other states where working conditions are better even if the salaries are lower. These are just some of the negative impacts.\" (Easton Gazette, Dec. 20, 2024)\nHow disappointed was I to read in The Star Democrat (Jan. 15, 2025) that the Talbot Board of Education wishes to implement the Blueprint anyway, especially equity in math, with an $8.6 million increase to the school budget. With nearly 60% of Talbot County students (grades 3-8) showing a lack of proficiency in basic English language skills, while mathematics proficiency for Talbot County students stands at a dismal 17.2%, the last thing we need is for our children to be guinea pigs in yet another social experiment.\nWhat is equity in math? According to Edutopia: \"Math teachers can use short activities based on student goals related to equity in order to make classes feel more inclusive and accessible.\" The key words are \"feel\" \"inclusive\" and \"accessible.\"\nI was a sixth grader once, a sixth grader who hated math class. We had a strict teacher, of whom most of us were afraid. But we all learned to multiply and divide, in spite of the negative feelings, unlike, it appears, many of today's children who are not even being encouraged to memorize their times tables.\nThose negative feelings can give way to feelings of confidence and assurance when a subject has been mastered. I beg our educators to return to basics and stop making our children the latest casualties of yet another half-baked, ill-conceived progressive scheme for remaking society according to the designs of Karl Marx or Saul Alinsky.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Four winners are chosen: one early elementary student, one elementary student, one middle schooler and one high schooler.\nThis school year, the winners were:\nVienna Elementary second grader Adalynn Haugh.Hurlock Elementary third grader Kali Johnson.North Dorchester Middle eighth grader Elisabeth Claggett.North Dorchester High 10th grader Adrien Sinkeldam.\nTheresa Connors, the district's supervisor of English language learners, library media and fine arts, said the DCPS' central office staff loves getting to see the submissions and vote on their favorite every year. She said that each year the number of submissions gets larger.\n\"Even though they're supposed to screen them at the schools before they send them and choose their best, they send me more and more every year because it's hard for them to make a decision on what to send,\" she said. \"So it's very competitive.\"\nAs Connors read the names of each winner, the students got up from their chairs to accept a certificate and show off their designs, which included snowmen, Christmas trees and snow globes. Their teachers were also at the meeting to show support. Sinkeldam was not able to attend.\nAt the end of the meeting, Dorchester County Board of Education members and Superintendent Jymil Thompson talked about the students and their designs. Thompson said they did a \"fantabulous\" job.\n\"I just made that word up,\" he said, laughing. \"I really, really liked the cards. And everyone we sent the cards to liked the cards. ... They did a great job.\"\nBoard President Sheri Hubbard called it a \"wonderful time\" when students are recognized at board meetings.\n\"That's one of the best parts of this job,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Currently, with carryover in funds from previous years, the estimated deficit is at $10.19 million.\n\"We've just got some difficult decisions to make as a district on how we're going to move forward with the current budget crisis that we're in,\" DCPS Superintendent Jymil Thompson said during a Dorchester County Board of Education budget work session Thursday.\nJodi Colman, district assistant superintendent of academics and student services, said the budget increases for fiscal year 2026 make it possible to keep the district's current staff in place.\n\"This would just be to basically maintain the programs that we have right now,\" she said about the draft budget. \"All of those increases were due to just keeping our staff that we have for the most part.\"\nThompson said \"a whole host of things\" has caused the deficit, mentioning fixed costs and unfunded mandates from the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state.\nBoard of Education Member Brandy Dawson Cumberland said that although the board likes a lot of what the Blueprint aims to do, there are \"certain unfunded mandates that are going to cut other things.\"\nThompson said the district is still waiting on exact numbers from the state and county. He said once they have those numbers, it is possible the deficit could be lower than $10.19 million.\n\"But I don't think that it will be higher than that,\" he said.\nSo far, the district has taken a number of actions to reduce the deficit, Thompson said. This includes:\nReducing some positions added with Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief fundingSending emails about non-essential spendingDeciding not to hire for vacated positionsReducing the central office custodian scheduleReducing student support monitorsMerging some job dutiesEliminating the education specialist position\n\"We did try to make some significant changes,\" Thompson said. \"And there's more that I didn't put up that we have done. But the reality is it's not enough.\"\nThe district is looking into more actions that can be taken to reduce the deficit. Some possible actions include revisiting who should have board vehicles, auditing and reducing the number of programs and platforms the district uses, revising overtime policies, sharing resources with the county and reducing staff.\n\"No one wants this one,\" Thompson said about reducing staff.\nWhile listing different \"cost containment options\" Thompson and board members made it clear that the district hasn't made any decisions yet, and is just looking at potential cost-cutting options.\n\"We are just at the beginning of starting to think about what things we can do to attack that number,\" Board of Education Vice President Talibah Chikwendu said.\n\"And that's why we really would like to have public input to know what the public feels are areas we should focus on if possible,\" Board President Sheri Hubbard said. \"Because we want to do what's best for kids, bottom line.\"\nThe Dorchester County Board of Education will host another budget work session on Feb. 13. It will also hold one in March. The district's proposed budget must be submitted to the county in June.\nBoard Member Chris Wheedleton said that if community members are able to do anything, they should talk with their representatives in Annapolis.\n\"Because we need their help,\" he said.\nThompson urged that this is the time to work together and not be divided.\n\"Because at the end of the day, we know that $10 million deficit that we're in, that's going to hurt the kids,\" he said. \"That's going to have a profound impact on how we can provide resources for our students.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore and the state legislature aim to tackle a $3 billion deficit.Hiram Burch, the local government research and analysis manager for the department, shared that local governments across the state will have to pick up around $144 million of the gaps in the fiscal year 2026 budget as proposed.\nIn Caroline and Talbot counties, projected local cost shifts are in the $700,000 range. Dorchester County is at $830,000, while Queen Anne's County leads the pack for the Mid-Shore at $970,000. Kent is the lowest of the five counties with a $300,000 projection.\nMany of those cost shifts come in the education realm, including teacher retirement funding.\nDel. Steven Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) questioned whether record education funding that the governor's office has touted was due to the governor's actions or the result of The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's funding plan for education passed under former Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\"The governor's saying we have record funding to education,\" Arentz said. \"And I'm wondering if that's mandated from The Blueprint.\"\n\"Most education funding is formula-based,\" Burch said. \"He's required to put that in.\"\nBurch said while Moore did provide some \"enhanced funding,\" most of the state aid is required by formulas in The Blueprint.\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) said she's hearing from constituents that they're concerned about special education funding amid around $200 million in proposed cuts to the state Developmental Disabilities Administration.\nBurch said that none of the state aid reductions will affect special education.\n\"There were reductions in collaborative learning that impacted the foundation program, the compensatory aid program (and) the English language learners program, but this reduction did not affect special education funding,\" Burch said.\n\"That is the one area that has been held harmless by his proposed reductions and postponing the implementation of The Blueprint,\" he added.\nAt the close of Friday's budgetary discussions, Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said the state is \"very willing to pass unfunded mandates down to the counties.\"\n\"What this means really for Eastern Shore citizens, is their tax rates, their rates on their property, are going up,\" Adams said, referencing increasing property assessments. And that's how we're unfortunately going to be funding Maryland.\"\n\"That's my raw take on it, and many of our members are very concerned,\" Adams said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore's proposed state budget for next year come as the state faces a near $3 billion deficit.\nWith the potential cuts on the horizon, Simmons wants parents and students to know they will be OK in 2026, but in the long term, he said, the cuts will add up.\n\"I don't want to spread fear and panic for anyone watching at home,\" Simmons said. \"Caroline County Public Schools is going to be OK in FY26. We would be a lot better OK if the promise of Blueprint was there and the reduction wasn't there.\"\nThe Blueprint, the state's education improvement and funding initiative through 2032, originally outlined an increase in teacher collaborative time, during which teachers are not in classes and can plan, grade or meet with students individually. But with adjustments made in the state's budget to combat the deficit, collaborative time will take a hit.\nOther Blueprint cuts will impact the district in the coming years as well, the superintendent said.\nFoundation funding, or the base level per pupil funding from the state, is expected to decrease by $868,273 in 2026, according to Simmons' presentation.\nCompensatory education is the fund for students in low-income areas allowing free or reduce lunch for students. In 2026, the proposed funding for compensatory education will decrease by $513,912.\nIn 2026 the proposed funding for multilingual learners, or students who speak languages other than English, decrease by $91,425.\nAlthough these funding declines are manageable, over time the numbers will grow, causing bigger problems, Simmons said.\nFoundation reductions are projected to be over $25.6 million in the next eight years. Compensatory education will see a more than $13.5 million decline, and multilingual learners will see a nearly $2.5 million decline. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot school leaders discuss immediate, long-term effects of Blueprint cuts\n\n February 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 494\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Budget cuts in The Blueprint for Maryland's Future could have a potential impact of $1.7 million to Talbot County Public Schools this fiscal year, district officials said Monday.That gap is the amount of additional local funding the district may need if the governor's current budget proposal is passed, Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said to Board of Education members during Monday's work session.\nShe added that the impacts may snowball over the next eight years to the tune of more than $30 million in reduced funding from the state.\n\"These are deep cuts that are being proposed,\" Jones said.\nGov. Wes Moore filed the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act last month, a bill that proposes drastic cuts to education funding amid a nearly $3 billion state budget deficit.\nIf passed, the most significant cut would be a reduction in the \"per-pupil foundation\" funding outlined in The Blueprint's original formulas. In fiscal year 2026, it would reduce Talbot County's funding by $685,000, according to district calculations.\nThat's more than a third of the projected $1.7 million gap created by state cuts this year, which also includes reductions in compensatory education and multilingual learners funding, a decrease in the state's share of nonpublic special education tuition costs, and a hike in how much pension costs districts are required to pick up.\nDistrict Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the cuts to foundation funding per pupil, along with the slashes to compensatory and multilingual education, stand out. Superintendents across the state are continuing to advocate against the proposals, she said.\n\"While this excellence in education bill overall is saving money, it's still not hitting the foundation,\" Pepukayi said. \"That's the main push in the advocacy.\"\nThe superintendent said it's been conveyed that districts are expected to go back to counties \"to make up those expenses.\"\n\"That's all well and good if you live in Montgomery County or Prince George's County,\" Board Vice President Amy Dodson said. \"That doesn't really help us out here.\"\nDuring the meeting, Jones provided what the cumulative reductions in funding to Talbot County will be if the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act passes as proposed. For fiscal years 2026 through 2033, $20 million would be stripped from what the current Blueprint formulas outline for per-student funding.\nAdditionally, $9 million in compensatory education aid and $2.9 million in multilingual learner aid could be slashed over the next eight years, she said.\nBoard President Emily Jackson suggested board members begin their own advocacy amid the looming cuts.\n\"If we could, as a board, come together and talk about how we could take a stand here, I think that would be good,\" Jackson said. \"I think that would be a good first step in that direction.\"\nDodson added on, asking if members of the community could speak up, too.\n\"Do we want to get people in the community to write letters about this at this point? They're chopping our funding majorly,\" Dodson said. \"It seems like people in the community should also speak up, if they're so inclined.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Significant increases include salary costs and fixed charges.\nTalbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said that $2 million is built out for 33 \"highly necessary,\" additional positions. The budget also accounts for $1.3 million in expected health insurance cost increases due to inflation and the new positions, she said.\nJones noted that while the unrestricted budget is $8.9 million higher than last year, the overall budget of $95.9 million \u2014 made up of restricted and unrestricted funds \u2014 is only up by $3.6 million. This is mostly due to a year-to-year decrease in federal grant funding.\n\"So it is not, in total, a significant increase,\" Jones said. \"There has been a significant shift from federal to \u2026 local.\"\nNext month, the district will present the budget to the Talbot County Council. The council will hold a public budget hearing in May.\nThe district will be asking the county for approximately $18.4 million in capital funding \u2014 $18.1 million for ongoing renovations at Chapel District Elementary School and $260,000 for new stadium lights at St. Michaels Middle High School.\nWednesday, Board of Education President Emily Jackson complimented Jones for her work during the budget process. She said she's comfortable with the budget while acknowledging that much is unknown in regards to the state's contributions.\n\"I will vote yes on the budget when it comes to that, because I feel like this is a very sound budget based in fact of what we do know,\" Jackson said.\nBoard Member Cynthia Jurrius said she appreciates that the budget aligns with the district's strategic goals.\n\"We do know we have some potential things down the road that may change the budget as far as what state funding we get (and) what changes may come down the road there,\" Jurrius said. \"But for what we know now, I think this is a good budget and a sound plan.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Administrative regulations do not require board approval.\nUnder the dress code standards, wording that singled out specific clothing items, such as \"low rider pants\" and \"spaghetti straps,\" was removed. The dress code largely remained unchanged aside from a few strikethroughs.\nBoard Member Ann O'Connor asked why some of the language was removed. Pepukayi said there were discrepancies of students getting coded, particularly in regards to body shape and size.\n\"Some of our administrators feel like they spend a lot of their day chasing down specific, indicated things in dress code,\" Board President Emily Jackson said. \"And it becomes a barrier to creating a relationship. And we feel like we are policing tiny little infractions all day long.\"\nThe board president later added that when it comes to dress code, she's in favor of standards that promote \"the dignity, and value and worth of each student\" rather than rules that police \"individual items of clothing.\"\nBoard Member Deborah Bridges said the revision \"guts what we had intended it to be.\"\nO'Connor said while she wasn't on the board for past discussions regarding dress code policy, she doesn't see a need for spaghetti straps to be permitted. She then raised the topic of school uniforms.\n\"In fact, I know this is probably not the way to bring it up, but I'm in full favor of school uniforms,\" O'Connor said.\nShe said uniforms would put everyone \"on the same playing field\" and \"solve all problems.\" O'Connor asked for it to be put on the table as an option.\nPepukayi said the topic of school uniforms has been discussed since she joined the district in 2022. Rochelle Eisenberg, the board's attorney, said the board does have the power to require school uniforms.\n\"You can have a policy requiring school uniforms so long as you would be willing to purchase them for children whose families could not afford them,\" Eisenberg said.\n\"I'm not opposed to uniforms,\" Board Vice President Amy Dodson said. \"I actually went to a high school that required uniforms, and I personally loved them as a student because I didn't have to think about what I was going to wear.\"\n\"I know the kids aren't in favor of this at all, but it would solve many problems,\" O'Connor said.\nEisenberg suggested no matter how the board proceeds, it should procure sufficient community input.\nJackson, who has been on the board since 2018, said the discussion of school uniforms has come up under past superintendents. She suggested the board look at past data and outcomes.\n\"I was told that it was once tried and it was not widely adopted, and it was very hard to enforce,\" Jackson said. \"I think that was at one of our elementary schools.\"\nPepukayi said talking with administrators and advisory committees can be a \"starting point.\"\n\"I'll talk to team members who've been here to get some historical context,\" Pepukayi said. \" \u2026 And then with current groups that we have, we'll formulate some questions and get some information.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

At Mace's Lane, eighth grade reading proficiency increased 20.8% from the beginning of year assessment. It increased from 35.2% to 56%.\nAt North Dorchester Middle, eighth grade reading proficiency increased 1.1%, from 51.9% to 53%. At South Dorchester School, eighth grade reading proficiency increased 4%, from 64% to 68%.\nAberg said the test's national vendor reached out about Mace's Lane Middle's eighth grade scores because they were confused about the major increase.\n\"Students are only meant to grow at the eighth grade level by 4.5 percentage points,\" she said. \"We had students growing by crazy amounts.\"\nAberg said she thinks students didn't show \"what they're actually made of\" on the beginning of the year assessment.\n\"And I believe that is a much more accurate picture of our students,\" she said about the middle of the year scores.\nAt the end of the presentation, Board of Education Member Christine LaMonica said this generation of children is inquisitive. \"And they want to know the 'why,'\" she said. \"And if you can grasp them in on the 'why,' then they show you what they got.\"\nMentioning her own experience as a teacher, Board President Sheri Hubbard said the bottom line is kids have to feel it's important to show what they know.\n\"And no matter how hard teachers try, it's just hard,\" she said. \"And so we need everybody working together to impress upon the kids how important it is for them to show what they know.\"\nHubbard said it's about more than a test.\n\"Not just for the school system,\" she said. \"Who cares what we get on a test?

    "content": "Thousands of Maryland students are chronically absent each year\n\n February 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: NATALIE WEGER Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1023\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Baltimore city principal Yetunde Reeves makes it a priority to encourage strong attendance at her school. Reeves, principal of Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, said improving attendance is the first step in educating her students.\"We have just made it like a big deal here and it's something that we have a campaign around,\" Reeves said. \"Every time I interact with a student, I always look at their attendance.\"\nStudent absenteeism rates have proliferated across the state and the country since the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of Maryland students are absent from school each year.\nWhat causes chronic absenteeism?\nChronic absenteeism, when students miss 10% or more of school, has surged across the nation after the COVID-19 pandemic. This means many students are missing out on at least 18 days of school each academic year.\nIn Maryland, nearly 27% of students were chronically absent in the 2023-2024 school year, an increase of over 7% from 2018, according to Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) data. Chronic absenteeism in Maryland reached almost 40% in 2022.\nAbsenteeism can be caused by a variety of factors, according to Jing Liu, an assistant education professor at the University of Maryland.\nSchool climate can contribute to absences, especially if students don't feel safe or a sense of belonging to the school, Liu explained. Some students may move homes frequently or have the responsibility to take care of their siblings. Others may deal with personal health issues.\n\"There's no single reason for student absenteeism,\" Liu said. \"It's really complex in terms of the interplay between the individual student, their family, their school environment and even their community.\"\nHaving 10 absences across all subjects in 9th grade reduces both the probability of a student graduating and enrolling in college by 2%, according to a 2021 study published in the Journal of Economics. Liu, who contributed to the study, said missing school can lead to lower test scores and grades.\nWhich counties face highest rates?\nBaltimore City had the highest chronic absenteeism rate of all 24 Maryland jurisdictions, with nearly half of all public school students chronically absent last school year.\nReeves said transportation can be a barrier to Baltimore city students, especially when some travel more than an hour and a half to attend school.\nTwo Baltimore City schools had chronic absenteeism rates higher than 90% last school year. Some schools with a high chronic absenteeism are alternative high schools or serve students with special needs.\nRates were also especially high for high school students. Last school year, 35% of Maryland high school students were chronically absent from school, compared to about 23% of elementary school students.\nAbsenteeism rates are higher among Hispanic and Black students. Last school year, over 45% of Hispanic students and over 40% of Black students were chronically absent from school, according to state data. Over 24% of white students and almost 17% of Asian students were chronically absent in the 2023-2024 school year.\nHow can this be addressed in schools?\nPrincipal Eugenia Young spends many nights worrying about the students absent from class at her Baltimore City high school.\nYoung is the principal of Excel Academy at Francis M. Wood High School, an alternative high school that serves adult students who are often many credits away from graduation. Excel Academy had an attendance rate of 44% last school year, according to Baltimore City Public Schools.\n\"Our kids don't get educated, they will struggle,\" Young said. \"That means the country will struggle, that means the city of Baltimore will struggle.\"\nDespite Excel Academy's high rate of chronic absenteeism, the high school won an award from Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott after increasing its daily attendance by 16% between 2023 and 2024.\nEffective strategies to combat absenteeism included putting students on attendance contracts and scheduling parent conferences, Young said. The school also provided incentives like gift cards or snow tubing trips.\n\"Kids really want to do those experiences, because they know in a normal setting, that's not something that their parents may be able to afford for them to do,\" Young said. \"They're still kids at the end of the day.\"\nSebastian Harris, a senior at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Baltimore City, said he has barely missed school throughout his academic career. Some students will still skip school because they get bored or can drive somewhere else, he explained.\n\"It's a problem because it's affecting more than just what you're learning today,\" Harris said. \"It affects tomorrow and the day after and the day after.\"\nBut Harris doesn't just have strong attendance because of the incentives his school offers. Sometimes, it's the teachers who make a difference. Many students attend Harris' Spanish class, for example, because his teacher keeps students engaged.\nMonique Keene-King, a pupil personnel worker in Montgomery County Public Schools, said relationship-building can improve student attendance. This can range from dropping by a family's house or simply complimenting a student in the hallway, she said.\nUltimately, school staff must let students know that they will not give up on them, Keene-King said.\n\"We care about kids,\" she said. \"We want our young people to be productive and successful community members.\"\nStatewide efforts\nBeyond citywide approaches, state education leaders are taking initiative to address chronic absenteeism across Maryland schools. The Maryland State Department of Education stated it is committed to reducing the chronic absenteeism rate to 15% by next school year.\nA Maryland General Assembly bill introduced in January aims to create a chronic absenteeism task force that will make recommendations to the governor by the end of 2025. Another bill introduced in the same month mandates each county board of education to identify the root cause of chronic absenteeism.\nDelegate Deni Taveras (D-Prince George's), the second bill's primary sponsor, said finding the root cause of chronic absenteeism at the local level will be a smart use of taxpayer dollars.\n\"This will help inform the task force so that they can develop the recommendations that they need,\" she said.\nMary Gable, assistant state superintendent at MSDE, said the education department's current attendance task force is developing a toolkit to address student absenteeism.\nUltimately, school needs to be a place where students feel safe to learn and improve, Gable said. It should be a place, she said, where someone can look at a student and say, \"We're glad you're here today.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS \u2014 Last week, the Commissioners of St. Michaels introduced an ordinance would allow St.Michaels Middle High School to have an illuminated sign outside of the school.The potential sign would bring more attention to events and announcements of school activities, proponents argued.\nSt. Michaels Middle High School students attended the introduction of the ordinance. Senior Phoebe Cole and junior Kyle Murphy spoke about how important an illuminated sign would be for the school.\n\"I think that having this big noticeable sign with the information of our games, half days and just school information, it would bring a lot more people to our school and a lot more revenue to our school,\" Cole said.\nWhile Cole discussed what the potential new sign would do, Murphy mentioned how the current sign doesn't grab anyone's attention.\n\"I don't think I've ever noticed a piece of information on that sign that is currently there,\" Murphy said. \"It's a waste of our administration and teachers time going out there putting out information that is just not being read. With this sign they can just change the information from a computer.\"\nCole and Murphy both talked about the exposure it would bring to the school and the town, which could get community members out to athletic games and school plays.\nThe town officials suggested that a change in the ordinance to allow the town to be able to announce other events besides school events on the sign. This change would allow other announcements beside school announcements to be made.\nThe officials also suggested changing the ordinance name from educational facilities to public school. This allows the town to control the amount of facilities that would need an illuminated sign.\nThe town government decided to move the ordinance to a second meeting, which would be a public hearing. The meeting is slated for the second town meeting in March. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025",

The officials decided on a post Labor Day start for the new school year.Tara Downes, assistant to the superintendent, came before the Caroline County Board of Education at the March 4 board meeting. A survey was sent out to parents and staff on what start of school day was preferred.\nAccording to the survey, pre Labor Day start of school calendar was preferred by staff and parents in Caroline County, but survey officials felt from conversations with parents that the post Labor Day calendar was preferred.\n\"What I have heard has not been this,\" Board Member Chrissy Bartz said. \"Some feedback I've received is that its not their preference.\"\nThe board members discussed what factors played into each calendar to make their decision. Teachers having a longer break was one of the deciding factors.\n\"I worry about our teachers coming back that early and have a full July of summer camp and kids in building,\" Bartz said. \"I think if we could give them a few more days and have that long weekend available for families, I am hearing families would prefer that.\"\nFor the 2025-26 school year calendar the first day of school is slated to be Tuesday, Sept. 2. Teachers will return to the building on Aug. 25 to begin planning for the new school year.\nColonel Richardson High School is set to hold graduation on May 27, 2026, and North Caroline High School is set to hold graduation on May 28, 2026.\nThe last day of school for students is June 17, and the last day for teachers is slated for the day after.\nThe county has three inclement weather days accounted for in the calendar for the new school year. In the 2024-25 school year calendar, there were four inclement weather days, and all four have been used to account for snow this winter.\n\"The board can always change the number of snow days that we build in,\" Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"The board always has the ability to take certain days that are not state required days, we just have appeal to the state.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Projections from 2022 estimated the county would owe $23.9 million for fiscal year 2026 education expenses, according to projections from the Maryland Department of Legislative Services.\nThat is $2.4 million less than what is currently projected.\nPfeffer said that in 2022, the county expected to owe the district $26.8 million in fiscal year 2030.\n\"So we're almost at fiscal year '30,\" he said about how much the county is paying for education with the Blueprint in place.\nPfeffer said that in fiscal year 2034, the county expects it will have to spend $36.3 million on education. He said that in 2022, the county expected it would be paying $29.4 million in fiscal year 2034.\n\"They need more money than we can give them,\" Pfeffer said about the school district, adding that the county's issue is not with the district, but with the state's plan. \"We just cannot pay our bills that are unfundedly mandated on this county.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

While this is a state- funded project the counties in the community college district are expected to contribute as well.\nContacted after the meeting, Chesapeake College President Clifford Coppersmith offered some information about the proposed building.\n\"The building project we have proposed is to replace an existing facility that is very dated,\" Coppersmith said. \"The existing Queen Anne's Tech Building was built in 1976 and is the last building on campus that has not been renovated.\"\nThree of the five counties must be on board to approve this new proposed building.\nThe proposed new building will take three years to build. If funded by the state, Caroline County's total share adds up to $2.7 million over three years in the capital funding budget.\nCoppersmith believes that the state will leave the funding for the replacement and renovations college in the state budget.\n\"It's huge,\" Coppersmith said about the state potential funding for the proposed building. \"The state ultimately bears 75% of the cost of the construction with our local counties sharing the 25% share.\"\nFor Caroline County, the share for the first year will be $180,000, but in fiscal year 2027-28, the larger chunk of the $2.7 million will be in the capital budget. The county is worried about the capital funds for the next two years.\n\"I'm just concerned we may not have any money for capital next year,\" County Commission President Travis Breeding said. \"I personally think it's a good conservative play to build it into this year's budget, fund it, if we are going to be on the hook for it let's fund it so we don't have to worry about funding any of it next year. Either we deal with it now, or we worry about it next year.\"\nThe commissioners decided to table the discussion until the end of the budget workshop to make a final decision on how the capital funds for Chesapeake College will be allocated.\n\"I would say yes we leave it here and when we get to the final process on this years budget we go back and take a look at it,\" County Commission Vice President Larry Porter said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Community school leaders in Talbot County aim to make a difference\n\n March 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 794\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 In her third year as community school manager at Easton Elementary, Katie Fox's job is all about removing barriers for students in need and becoming a community resource.\"The premise of a community school is for you to be the community hub,\" Fox said of her role. \"So you serve as a resource for everyone.\"\nIt's a relatively new position in Talbot County Public Schools and across the state. In 2019, community schools were introduced as part of The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's initiative to fund and improve education.\nMore than 600 Maryland schools are community schools. Two are in Talbot County: Easton Elementary and Easton Middle. Those schools receive extra funds to create services for students and families in poverty.\nAs future funding remains up in the air this legislative session, Talbot County's two community schools are moving forward at two different stages of the process.\nLast school year, Easton Elementary came up with an implementation plan and goals. Those goals are to increase availability of healthy foods, provide mental health resources, raise enrichment by 15%, and add 100 students to the school's Choptank Community Health partnership, Fox said.\nFox, a longtime teacher before taking on her current role, said those needs become apparent.\n\"You could probably spot test any single classroom teacher. All of those things spike up,\" Fox said. \"Food insecurity, needing materials, clothing. All of that is prevalent in all of the spaces, especially post-pandemic.\"\nEaston Elementary is in its third year as a community school. Starting off, the school received state funding to hire Fox's position and a health care practitioner. In Year 3, it received \"per-pupil\" funding to begin providing specific services and resources.\nFox said the per-pupil funding has supported before- and after-school programs and Teddy Bear Fresh Produce boxes for family events, among other programs.\nEaston Middle, meanwhile, is in its first year. Community school facilitator Shelby Parks is spearheading a needs assessment that includes staff, family, student and community surveys.\nAt the middle school, Parks says mental health, food insecurity and transportation are focus areas.\n\"We can't offer too many after-school programs because we just don't have the transportation, and students are struggling,\" Parks said.\nFox noted that transportation to grocery stores for neighborhoods around Easton Elementary and Easton Middle is a challenge.\n\"We don't have a current grocery store that's within walking distance, so that's just something to consider,\" Fox said. \"If the family doesn't have their own personal transportation, it makes it more difficult to access any kind of healthy food outside of a few restaurants that are there.\"\nFUNDING UNCERTAINTY\nAttempting to close a nearly $3 billion state deficit, Gov. Wes Moore proposed a budget in January with significant cuts and freezes to education funding, including for community schools. Many education advocates pushed back.\nHis budget proposed freezing community school funding at next year's levels, potentially impacting the money provided to schools such as Easton Elementary in future years.\nBut last week, the House of Delegates amended some of Moore's education cuts by passing a refined Blueprint education bill. The House struck through his proposed pause to community school funding and sent the bill to the Senate chamber.\nKristen Tilghman, Blueprint implementation coordinator for Talbot County Public Schools, said the district is watching closely to see if community school funding is paused or affected in any way.\nThe district is \"going to move forward because our community clearly has a need,\" Tilghman added. Easton High, White Marsh Elementary and Tilghman Elementary are the district's schools next in line to become community schools. Job postings for community school program leaders are active for those three schools.\nTilghman said the state funding \"sets the stage\" for schools to create partnerships and assist families all over Talbot County.\n\"(It's) vital to the whole community, not just that particular school's community,\" she said.\n'HELPING ALL'\nTalbot school leaders emphasized that theme of not just helping the designated community schools but bettering the entire district.\nFor instance, Fox is involved in monthly food distributions for families across the district, not just Easton Elementary.\n\"Because we're a small county, I can do this heavy lift at Easton Elementary, but Easton Middle and High and Chapel (District Elementary) and Tilghman (Elementary) can benefit from some of the things that are happening,\" she said.\nAs Parks prepares to move EMS into the implementation phase next year, she's watching how Fox makes an impact at the elementary school.\n\"I'm excited that if Easton High comes on board, we can see trends between Easton Elementary, Easton Middle and Easton High, how it all flows, how we all work together,\" Parks said.\nThe concept of working together applies not just for every school in Talbot County, but for every student in each school. Fox said all students benefit from the community school resources and programs.\n\"You create something for one, it always ends up helping all,\" Fox said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Since January, the school district has reduced its estimated budget deficit, which is separate from the county's budget, from $10.19 million to $5.59 million. It is still looking for ways to further reduce the deficit.\nBoth the district and county \u2014 which gives a portion of its revenues to the district every year \u2014 have said state mandates regarding the Blueprint for Maryland's Future are affecting their budgets.\nDuring the council meeting, DCPS Superintendent Jymil Thompson and Board of Education member and Finance Chair Chris Wheedleton presented on the district's draft budget for fiscal year 2026, reiterating what was shared during a Board of Education budget work session in late February. Thompson said the district will be presenting more changes to the budget at another Board of Education budget work session on March 20.\nAfter the presentation, Detmer said $5 million of the district's deficit equates to a 15% increase in property tax rates.\n\"My question is how much do athletic programs cost?\" he asked. \"How much do school plays cost? How much does operating two high schools instead of one high school in the county, how much does that cost?\"\nBoard of Education Vice President Talibah Chikwendu, who was sitting in the audience at the meeting, stood up to answer Detmer's question. She said sending all the county's high schoolers to one high school would increase transportation costs, increase class sizes and hurt student achievement.\nChikwendu said the Blueprint, which is a state plan that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education, does not just increase starting teacher salaries, but it changes what makes a student eligible to graduate.\nShe said getting rid of extracurriculars like athletics, which are outlets for students, will increase the district's dropout rate.\n\"If we do not have graduates, we do not have good employees, we do not have homeowners, we do not have property taxes to spend,\" she said. \"Everything is connected largely to how well we educate our students.\"\nChikwendu said removing extracurriculars would affect school culture and climate.\n\"That's also part of what the state evaluates,\" she said. \"And if those things slide, so do then our ratings and so do then what the state provides to us.\"\nDetmer said he resents having to ask those questions.\n\"I resent the fact that a one-size-fits-not-us solution has been passed down,\" he said about the Blueprint. \"I would much rather be waiting for recommendations developed here for how to best serve our students.\"\nDetmer said he would like to have the county look into asking for a special dispensation so the district can follow a plan that is tailored to it.\n\"We've just heard that the big, nuclear solutions, for many reasons, aren't tenable,\" he said. \"We can't just close multiple schools.\"\nDetmer said the county needs to follow a plan for education improvement that is slower and more purposeful.\n\"We don't have the property tax base,\" he said.\nCouncil President Lenny Pfeffer said the council will be directing county staff to look at options to solve the deficit, including looking into getting a dispensation. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Five years ago, Tamara Forte was in her 15th year of teaching first grade. On Friday, March 13, teachers were told to pack up their classrooms as if for summer vacation, covering items with bulletin board paper. They thought it would be for only two weeks.\"The fear of the unknown was big,\" Forte said. \"We were closing the school buildings but had no idea what the future would hold and how long it would be for.\"\nConditions were constantly changing, with teachers having little control or input. After closing for two weeks, teachers learned they would have to send learning packets home. Some parents printed the packets through email, while others picked them up at school. Staff members delivered packets to students' homes when necessary.\nForte admits having to ask colleagues for help recalling some details of what they went through five years ago.\n\"It was a blur, and I blocked many details out. It was a hard, worrisome time,\" she said. Her day care closed after she had paid weeks to hold her spot. \"My day care had closed; my work had closed. It felt like the world was closing down.\"\nAt home, Forte watched videos on properly cleaning and disinfecting groceries, even cereal boxes, as she moved them between counters. She balanced keeping her family safe while maintaining her teaching responsibilities.\nTeachers continued being flexible and adapting to unprecedented circumstances. Forte's sister traveled from New Jersey to help create a classroom in her basement. With a laptop and projector, teachers did their best to make virtual learning engaging.\nThey learned to conduct Zoom calls and waited patiently while students searched for misplaced pencils. Teachers virtually entered all their students' homes, observing family members engaged in various online activities that sometimes created distractions. Some students struggled without tech-savvy family members to assist them, while others, including Forte's own school-aged sons, had to learn to log in and out at specific times for whole group and small group instruction.\nTeachers spent considerable time troubleshooting frozen screens and internet glitches. Some created paper cutouts of themselves and mailed them to students with inspiring messages. They organized a school parade, decorating their cars with \"we miss you\" messages and driving through neighborhoods to wave and honk at their students. Teachers created grade-level photo collages with encouraging messages.\nWhen fall arrived, teachers returned to schools without students. They prepared pizza boxes full of materials for at-home use and distributed computers and hot spots to families in need. Before students could return, teachers learned to space desks 6 feet apart, marking the distance with tape.\nStudents gradually returned to school on rotating A/B schedules. Teachers simultaneously instructed in-person and at-home students. They observed children biting wet masks or dropping them on the floor before putting them back on. Physical expressions of encouragement like hugs and high-fives were no longer possible.\n\"Reflecting on teaching and life in the pandemic really makes you appreciate every smile, hug, high-five, and all the learning together,\" Forte said. \"It makes you cherish the many things that we take for granted every day. I never want to go back to this time.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Schools struggle to bridge learning gaps, adapt to a new normal\n\n March 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Andrea Grabenstein agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 726\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Five years after COVID-19 upended classrooms, Mid-Shore school districts are still working to close learning gaps, combat chronic absenteeism and adapt to lasting changes in education. While academic performance is improving across Maryland, with more schools earning top ratings, districts continue to wrestle with pandemic-era challenges \u2014 particularly in student engagement, virtual learning access and social-emotional development.\"We continue to see some gaps in students' learning,\" said Queen Anne's County Public Schools Superintendent Patricia Saelens, emphasizing the district's focus on tutoring, academic intervention and social-emotional strategies. Yet chronic absenteeism remains high, with some counties reporting rates above 25%, and virtual learning remains a logistical hurdle due to disparities in technology access.\nDespite the challenges, local educators say students have proven resilient, with many now excelling in academics and careers. The post-pandemic education system may look different, but its impact on today's students will be felt for years to come.\nLEARNING GAPSMaryland's most recent education report indicated steady improvements in school performance, with 91 schools achieving five-star ratings in the 2023-24 school year, up from 85 the previous year. About 41% of schools statewide received a four- or five-star rating, marking a gradual increase. However, despite these gains, schools statewide still fell short of meeting annual targets in every category.\nTo address learning gaps, Queen Anne's County Public Schools have expanded tutoring services where funding is available. Additional intervention programs in reading and math aim to support struggling students. Saelens stressed the need for continued focus on social-emotional learning, ensuring that students feel connected and ready to learn.\nCHRONIC ABSENTEEISMOne of the most persistent challenges post-COVID is chronic absenteeism, according to state Department of Education data. While attendance rates have improved since the height of the pandemic, absenteeism remains above 25% across the Mid-Shore:\nQueen Anne's County: 22.9%Kent County: 26%Caroline County: 28%Talbot County: 28.5%Dorchester County: 38.3%\nMatt Evans, supervisor of Student Services in Queen Anne's County said their district was already experiencing a slight increase in chronic absenteeism prior to the pandemic; however, that rate significantly increased during COVID-19 school closures and peaked during the 2021-2022 school year. Since then, the chronic absenteeism rate is on a steady decline but not back to the pre-pandemic rates, Evans said.\nHome instruction numbers also were increasing prior to the pandemic, with the sharpest increase and peak during the 2020-2021 school year. After 2020-2021, the home instruction numbers significantly decreased and ultimately plateaued, although they are not back to the pre-pandemic numbers, he noted.\nStatewide, officials are working to reengage students but lingering effects of pandemic-related disruptions continue to impact attendance.\nVIRTUAL LEARNINGVirtual learning, once an emergency measure, remains a complex issue. While some districts have successfully integrated online instruction for inclement weather closures, Queen Anne's County faces challenges in fully adopting virtual learning due to technology and connectivity limitations.\n\"In the state of Maryland, virtual learning days must adhere to all the guidelines of MSDE,\" Saelens said. \"Not all QACPS students have a one-to-one device, and unfortunately, we still have pockets throughout the district where internet connectivity is challenging.\"\nAdditionally, some teachers struggle with reliable internet access, making a full-scale virtual learning model unfeasible.\nADOPTION AND INNOVATIONDespite the setbacks, educators see lasting benefits from the changes forced by the pandemic. Kent County Public Schools Superintendent Mary Boswell-McComas noted that five years is a significant portion of a student's educational journey.\n\"A fifth grader in 2020 is now well into their high school years. Elementary school students today don't remember the pandemic and wearing masks,\" she said.\nWhile routines have returned to pre-COVID norms, teachers and students have become more proficient with technology. Virtual instruction, once foreign, is now a tool used strategically during weather-related closures.\nFederal funding post-pandemic helped schools innovate, including the implementation of student support coaches in Kent County classrooms. These coaches allow teachers to work with students in smaller groups, providing targeted academic support and aiding in social-emotional development.\nA NEW CHAPTERAs districts continue to navigate post-COVID realities, educators emphasize resilience and adaptation. Students who graduated during the pandemic are now succeeding at competitive universities and in the workforce, proving that the disruptions, while significant, did not define their futures.\n\"The pandemic was a challenging and troubling time for all of us: in schools, in our communities and around the world,\" Kent County's Boswell-McComas said. \"As with so many challenges, we have come out of it stronger. We learned more about ourselves and have incorporated innovative techniques that are still in use today.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Talbot County acquired the pouches and unlocking devices from the company Yondr.\n\"We would love to continue to have it at Easton Middle,\" principal Kelly Murdoch told the Talbot County Board of Education Wednesday.\n\"There's a positive impact on safety and wellness. We've seen a positive change in student engagement within the classrooms and during instruction,\" Murdoch added. \"Ultimately, we hope to see improvement with academic performance as well.\"\nAssistant principals Ashley Quicke and Todd Stoker echoed that sentiment Wednesday.\n\"(Students) do use the screens as their avenue to speak to someone,\" Quicke said. \"With them not being there, we are forcing this generation to have face-to-face conversations.\"\nStoker noted the school has a four-step disciplinary process for students who don't comply with the new rules. Beginning at the second offense, parents are called and must pick up the student's phone from the school office.\nBoard Vice President Amy Dodson asked if there's been a decrease in bullying since December.\n\"Absolutely. Definitely a decrease in any kind of cyberbullying,\" Murdoch said.\n\"Thank you for being our guinea pigs,\" President Emily Jackson said to the Easton Middle administrators. \"We really appreciate it. We know this was a big lift for everybody involved.\"\nJackson asked if they think the policy should be expanded to other schools in the district. Murdoch said she could only speak for EMS but that it's \"something to consider.\"\nStoker said it's important to look at research, which he said shows cell phone use negatively impacts the mental health of students starting at \"upper elementary through high school.\"\n\"We've certainly seen a positive impact, at least on our end, with students of that age,\" Stoker said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We're having budget meetings on a weekly basis. We're talking to our team consistently with the board. We're trying to make the best decision possible for Dorchester County Public Schools, and it's not easy.\"\nWhile giving a budget update at the meeting, Thompson said the district will be looking into reducing its staff by 12 to 24 positions. He said those layoffs could save the district between $900,000 and $1.8 million.\n\"There are no definitive positions that we have identified as of yet,\" he said. \"But we will be moving forward to doing that at our next meeting.\"\nThompson said the district has been in conversation with district principals, Dorchester Educators, Dorchester Educators Education Support Professionals and the Dorchester Administrators and Supervisors Association to discuss where those staff reductions could be made.\nThompson said the district wants to retain as many staff as possible and minimize the impact on teaching and learning.\n\"If we want to get from 23 to 15, we can't afford to lose teachers,\" he said about the district's state rating. \"We have to make sure that we keep our class sizes small and keep teachers at all costs. And we're trying to do what's best for everyone.\"\nThompson said the district is reviewing attrition rate trends. He said he believes the number of teachers who leave the district for retirement and other reasons at the end of the school year will help.\n\"And we may not have to reduce as many staff,\" he said. \"But we will have to reduce some staff.\"\nAlong with looking into staff reductions, Thompson said the district will be opening up negotiations with its staff representatives, which include Dorchester Educators, Dorchester Educators Education Support Professionals and the Dorchester Administrators and Supervisors Association.\n\"And the reason is because we cannot currently honor the step increases and the (cost of living adjustment),\" he said.\nThompson said the district could potentially save $3.5 million through these negotiations. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He pointed out that \u2014 contrary to the popular narrative of low test scores reflecting badly on CCPS \u2014 \"these kids were ridiculously good readers and the teachers are rockstars.\"\nHayhurst said that he sees a lot of the same kids at his Superdojo, so he enjoyed being able to connect with them both in a space outside of martial arts. At Superdojo, he focuses on taking abstract ideas like how to create a positive environment and making them relevant in his teaching of martial arts, which he brought into facilitating the gym class with a fun twist on a jump rope activity.\nHayhurst also brought dry erase markers to replace the dried up ones for a teacher, and created \"reading buddies\" \u2014 pom poms with googly eyes \u2014 to make reading activities more fun for the kids. His efforts to bring in new elements made a positive impact on the students and the faculty.\n\"Go into the classroom and believe that you're a leader and you can make a difference with the kids just by being a positive role model,\" Hayhurst said.\nHe was impressed with the students' math abilities. He joined in on a multiplication table competition doing as many problems as quickly as possible, thinking he would win. But to his surprise, \"I look up and there's a girl that had been finished for like 10 seconds just looking at me like, 'What took you so long,'\" Hayhurst said.\nHayhurst valued the opportunity to connect with students and teachers and encouraged others to do the same.\n\"That connection is really important, and we've lost it in our community. We don't even know who our neighbors are, but we can find our neighbors in our local schools, and everybody, I think, should be a part of the schools,\" Hayhurst said.\nDarius Humphries with Chesape \"Teacher for a Day\" event organized by the Education Foundation of Cecil County Public Schools at schools across the county.\nVarious business leaders and community members visited elementary schools, middle schools and high schools throughout the county from March 3 to 13.\nSchool officials said that situations such as these were the goal of the entire experience.\n\"We really just wanted our community to see what goes on, the amazing things that go on in our school every day and see what the kids are learning,\" Isaac said.\nNick LaBrant with Utilitrain had the opportunity to teach a Cherry Hill Middle School social studies class about the history of power lines. With an informative presentation and power line props, LaBrant immersed himself as a teacher.\n\"It was actually an incredible class,\" LaBrant said. \"I was able to give the students a little bit of an industry insight on something that really matters in the class.\"\nThe students had just learned about the history of railroads, so LaBrant's presentation fit right into the curriculum. LaBrant also educated students about soft skills necessary for the work force.\n\"I know that they're still in middle school, but I got to talk to them about teamwork and accountability and integrity from someone who's been out in the industry,\" LaBrant said.\nLaBrant added that he was impressed with the students' engagement with his lesson.\n\"For every student to be paying attention, have questions, remaining engaged, I think it says a lot of good things about our public school system here in Cecil County,\" LaBrant said.\nAs a parent himself, this initiative reminded LaBrant to get more involved in Cecil County schools, while seeing how much patience and gratitude the teachers have toward their students to be successful.\n\"We would welcome an opportunity to have another 'Teacher for a Day' next year and hope that people continue to take advantage of it,\" Isaac said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Plan to require school uniforms doesn't gain traction with Talbot Board of Ed\n\n March 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 453\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 A proposal to institute school uniforms in Talbot County failed to advance at last week's Board of Education meeting.Board member Ann O'Connor, who first raised the uniform topic at a meeting last month, made a motion to institute school uniforms. However, that motion did not carry, as none of the other six board members seconded.\nBefore the failed motion, Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi shared results of a community survey with the board. Nearly 1,900 responses were recorded \u2014 74% of those coming from parents, 15% from staff and 8% from students.\nOverall, around 49% opposed school uniforms, with 45% in favor and the remaining voting no opinion. Responses varied based on the grade level:\nElementary school: 49% in favor, 41% opposed.Middle school: 49% in favor, 42% opposed.High school: 44% in favor, 48% opposed.\nO'Connor said after one year of implementation, there could be a school shop with \"hand-me-down\" uniforms. She said purchasing uniforms wouldn't be \"an exorbitant expense.\"\nVice President Amy Dodson disagreed.\n\"If you have a family that is only making minimum wage, it's a significant expense,\" Dodson said. \"And you have a significant portion of our student population that is on free and reduced meals.\"\nBoard member Dyshekia Strawberry said she doesn't see the need to introduce uniforms since the survey didn't show \"an overwhelming response either way.\" President Emily Jackson concurred.\n\"I don't see an overwhelming need to make a major change in policy and procedure,\" Jackson said. \"Combined with the fact that, again, we are in a challenging budget year, and this would be an expensive undertaking should we go forward with it.\n\"Those two factors combined leave me not compelled to do anything in this regard.\"\nO'Connor said she was surprised by the high response rate. She told The Star Democrat she'd like the district to gather information on the impacts of uniforms at other schools and potentially revisit the topic next school year.\nIn an interview Friday, Pepukayi said she was surprised by both the high survey response rate and \"the closeness of the percentages that came out with elementary and middle\" school questions.\nThe superintendent said her team discussed the cost factors around having parents pay for uniforms, though they did not get into what specifics costs may be if the district assumed uniform payments.\nPepukayi said potentially helping families pay for school uniforms would bring up questions of which families the district helps and how that's determined.\n\"That's another discussion because then where do you draw the line?\" she said.\nPepukayi said she doesn't expect the topic of uniforms to come up again anytime soon.\n\"It didn't get the second (to) the motion, so it kind of died right there on the spot. But that's not to say it couldn't come up again,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Amid budget woes, Dorchester cancels summer school, appeals to students to 'get the work done'\n\n March 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 534\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Dorchester County Public Schools will not offer summer school this year, citing budget restraints. But county education officials say there is still time to improve grades for students who are at risk of having to repeat a grade.\"There is still time to pull it out,\" Dorchester County Board of Education President Sheri Hubbard said during a board meeting March 27. \"... Buckle down and work as hard as you can to get the grades to where they need to be so that you don't have to worry about there not being summer school.\"\nOn March 20, the district announced it would not be able to offer elementary and middle school summer sessions nor the high school credit recovery summer program in 2025 due to the district's need to adjust its programming.\nThe move does not affect the Extended School Year program for students receiving special education services nor the Summer Career Enrichment Program being offered in Talbot County.\n\"As we work to balance our budget for the upcoming fiscal year, we are having to realign our resources and adjust various programs,\" the announcement addressed to families said.\nCurrently, the district is facing a multi-million dollar deficit for fiscal year 2026.\nSince January, the district has reduced this deficit from $10.19 million to $5.59 million. During a Board of Education budget work session March 20, Superintendent Jymil Thompson said the district would next be looking into reducing its staff by 12 to 24 positions to save money. According the district, it currently has 859 total positions.\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR STUDENTSThe lack of summer school will mean if a student fails a course this school year, that student will not be able to make up the course this summer. The district wants parents to plan accordingly.\n\"If your student is failing a course, please reach out to the school to determine what can be done to help your child pass the course prior to the end of the school year so he/she does not risk being retained in the same grade level next year,\" the announcement said.\nDuring the Board of Education meeting March 27, Thompson said his suggestion to students is to take advantage of the time remaining in the school year \"to get the work done.\"\nHubbard said the board wishes the district could offer summer school this year.\n\"Of course we like to be able to offer summer school,\" she said. \"But in today's budget climate, it is not something that is foreseeable at this moment, so I do apologize.\"\nHubbard, who used to be a teacher, said teachers are generally willing to work with students who ask them if there is something they can do to bring up their grade.\n\"Whenever there was a student who came to me with sincerity and said, 'Is there something I can do? Can I please make up some work?' or whatever, we always came to some sort of way that that student was able to bring up their grades if they really wanted to,\" she said. \"It is possible.\"\nHubbard said the district doesn't want to have to hold students back.\n\"And we certainly don't want to keep anybody from graduating,\" she said. \"So just please, all of you work together and get it done.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Education workers empty their offices after recent layoffs\n\n April 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jade Tran and Jess DaninHirsch Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1041\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Washington \u2014 Suitcases and large cardboard boxes rolled across the pavement outside the Department of Education's offices last week as recently fired federal workers packed up their desks.Waiting outside, workers were greeted with claps, cheers and whistles as they emerged from the buildings, some raising their fists in defiance. Colleagues embraced, sharing quiet words or simply holding on. Signs with various messages floated above the crowd, most thanking the workers for their public service.\nWhat began as a smaller \"clap out\" outside the Office of the State Superintendent of Education, home to Free Application for Federal Student Aid offices, on Wednesday grew into a larger demonstration by Friday. Fired employees gathered at the Department of Education's headquarters, joined by advocates rallying in solidarity.\nAbout two weeks ago, workers in the department, which originally had 4,200 employees, began to hear rumblings of a large round of layoffs aimed at reducing the workforce by 50%. Some employees opted for early buyouts, while others took early retirements. The remaining 1,300 employees were subject to \"reduction in force\" notices, according to former employees Nikki Churchwell, of Calvert County, Maryland, from the Office of Performance and Improvement, and Kaitlyn Vitez, of Alexandria, Virginia, from the Office of Communications and Outreach.\nThe U.S. Office of Personnel Management lays out specific procedures for downsizing, which include ranking employees based on seniority and performance. However, Churchwell said the administration altered the way competitive areas were identified to bypass this process.\nVeronica Greene, 56, a nearly retired worker, made her way down the path outside the state superintendent's office, her belongings packed into two cardboard boxes stacked on a dolly. A security guard and another man, also carrying boxes, helped guide the load.\nA car pulled up to the corner of the building, its windows down. A man and a woman inside waved and clapped in support. With teary eyes, Greene said, \"These are my colleagues.\"\n\"We party hard. We love each other. It's hard to see these people leave because I don't know if I'll ever see them again, \" she said. \"Some I might, but a lot I might not.\"\nDescribing her experience, Greene said that she planned to retire, but this departure was not on her own terms. In just 15 to 20 minutes, the place she had considered home for decades was reduced to two boxes, after dedicating her life to student aid and loan services since 1991.\nHer days were spent answering phones and sorting through mail, but it was in her office in meetings, where she said she witnessed the dedication of her colleagues.\nKelisa Wing, of Virginia, a former employee with the Office of the Deputy Secretary at the Department of Education, was escorted to her workstation around 9 a.m. on Friday with just 30 minutes to pack up her belongings.\nAs she moved through the office, she noticed Homeland Security personnel monitoring the building. By 11 a.m., the walls of her workspace, once decorated with family photos, potted plants and an image of Martin Luther King Jr. from the night before his assassination, were bare.\nEverything had been carefully placed into a sleek black suitcase with a box stacked on top.\n\"All I ever wanted to be was an English teacher and look what God did, because of education,\" she said. \"Education saved my opportunities, so that's what they want to take away.\"\nThough for Wing, the moment was bittersweet. The abrupt departure offered a sense of closure, giving her the chance to say a proper goodbye to colleagues she had worked alongside for years.\n\"This is an assault on public education, because people know that education is the great equalizer,\" she said. \"It is the way that a student, a person like me, who came from nothing from Toledo, Ohio, from nothing, can end up working in a place like this.\"\nSupporters gathered with former employees, holding signs of solidarity. One sign, adorned with Sesame Street's Cookie Monster, read: Thank you! Gracias! Merci! Salamat!\nTony Sarmiento, a retired worker from Silver Spring, Maryland, who has attended 21 demonstrations in support of federal employees since the new administration took office, stood beside Greene, snapping photos and helping her with her belongings.\nHe said firings like these often lead to deep emotional struggles, with laid-off workers battling depression and self-blame.\n\"So, even with the completely irrational, cruel way these closings are happening,\" he said, \"there's a phenomenon where workers are so depressed, they aren't going to blame the right person.\"\nBill Bimber, a retired science and technology high school teacher with 34 years of experience in northern Virginia schools, spent many years without computers to teach his students computer repair. If it weren't for funding programs created by the Department of Education, he may never have received computers to teach his class.\nBimber expressed his concerns that if the department is experiencing massive layoffs, programs like this that provide equipment and materials to students may no longer get off the ground.\n\"I know how programs from this agency, this department, have affected schools over the years, and it's largely invisible, but it's huge,\" Bimber said. \"It really is enormous what they do.\"\nDressed in a Department of Education graphic T-shirt, Jackie Murray approached her firing with grace \u2014 after 40 years in communications and outreach \u2014 with a positive outlook on her future. After being placed on administrative leave over two months ago, the popular Murray bounced around the outside of the building with a smile and laughter.\nShe responded to a question about her next steps, saying, \"My mouth moves a lot, so it needs to get paid because it has to eat, you know.\"\nFor her, a support system of girlfriends, music, and scripture was key during moments like this that felt shared by many federal workers across the Washington region.\n\"Find you a support group that has accepted this, because there are still individuals, um, that I know who have not fully accepted this,\" she added, offering advice to those in her situation.\nIn the coming days, there will be debates about what form the department should take and how programs should be implemented, Vitez said.\n\"At the end of the day, we need to do what's best for schools \u2026 and for students and provide them the most resources and support to get the job done,\" she said. \"And people need more support, not less.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Consultant David Lever with Educational Facilities Planning LLC was contracted with to begin the process.\nAccording to Simmons, the committee will help give the consultant a picture of what a middle school facility should look like to educate kids in the modern era and moving forward.\nThe architect will use the Education Specification Committee's documents to help design the school, whether renovating the current structure or building a new school altogether.\nCounty Administrator and Committee Member Katheleen Freeman says the committee will go through multiple different scenarios and specifications to make sure the middle school is correctly designed.\n\"We're going to look at the square footage that's needed for the facilities that would be needed in the school,\" Freeman said. \"Also the traffic flow. Can can students walk to the school? If they have to drive, what's the traffic impact going to be? Is it going to be easy for parents to drop off and pick up, and the buses and all of that kind of thing?\"\nThe committee consists of multiple school officials from schools in Caroline County and officials from the state, as well as community members.\n\"We have teachers from Lockerman, we have members of the Lockerman Association,\" Simmons said. \"We have central office folks who are involved with curriculum as well as building and facilities. We have parents at our elementary schools, as well as administration from Lockerman. We have some state representation that's been invited because the state will be a major funder.\"\nAt the Nov. 26, 2024, Caroline County Commissioners meeting, Bill Mengel, director of operations at Caroline County Public Schools, said the state is projected to be receive $76 million in requested funding from the state.\nMengel said the $76 million is around 89% of the total $86 million estimated for years one and two of the project. The county would be responsible for the remaining 11% of the funding.\nSimmons said the forming of the committee is a first step in what will be a long process to bring the middle school together.\n\"It is a marathon in terms of pulling this together,\" Simmons said. \"As we work through the process, we want to really keep an eye on respecting the past and preparing for the future for the needs for Lockerman.\n\"We want to make sure that it's done right, something the community can be proud of. It is also a responsible use of the funding that will be used to build it. We are really looking forward to the process.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Any additional funding for education included would potentially lead to a property tax increase for residents by way of an education supplement.\n\"Putting an additional property tax supplement on them this year specifically is a challenge,\" Haythe said. \" ... I just believe we have to be very conservative and think about the vulnerable population.\"\nVice President Pete Lesher was the council's lone member in favor of including additional educational funding in the county's initial budget proposal. Lesher said it's \"not prudent\" to push off the education funding to next year.\n\"It would make next year a lot more painful,\" Lesher said. \" \u2026 I'd rather do steady, incremental increases than take a year off and be hit with a much larger percentage increase a year down the road.\"\nLesher warned that holding off on fulfilling some of the district's requests could endanger recent county investments for new positions such as math coaches and social workers, since the district is under state pressure to meet $60,000 teacher salary minimums.\nTCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said Tuesday the district won't be able to continue funding all its priorities if the county only provides the minimum required funding.\n\"We will have to prioritize and we will have to make some tough decisions,\" Pepukayi said.\nCouncil members and county officials said Tuesday the option to fulfill some or all of the $5.7 million ask remains available in the coming weeks as the budget is amended. A budget proposal will officially be introduced April 15.\nLONG-TERM UNCERTAINTY\nWhile the county held off on promising additional education funding Tuesday, council members and school leaders found common ground during a joint meeting Monday, fielding concerns over the long-term sustainability of the state's Blueprint initiative.\nTalbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones touched on projections from the Department of Legislative Services released in February, which forecast significant increases for how much money counties are expected to provide school districts.\nThe report shows Talbot County is expected to contribute $90 million to schools in fiscal year 2034, up $35 million from what the council is planning to obligate for FY2026.\n\"That's a really sobering increase, but it's baked into the law,\" Jones said. \"I don't know what the council's view is on how you're going to be able to meet this contribution.\"\nJones said the DLS calculations, in part, are derived from The Blueprint's goals to improve teacher compensation and provide needed student support.\nHaythe said it's going to take time for the county to assess whether meeting those requirements is possible.\n\"We would have to come together as a council and really think through, get the details, work with (Finance Director Martha Sparks) to determine how we can get there, and if we can get there,\" she said.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said the state doesn't always offer financial solutions when it asks counties to fork over funding for The Blueprint. She said the state advising districts to ask counties to fill funding gaps isn't effective.\n\"That's not good government, that's not good planning, that's not good oversight,\" Jackson said. \"But I think that the people in this room can do all those things, good planning, good government, good foresight, good working together.\"\nAs for the looming $90 million mark, officials agreed it's going to take joint strategic planning and a lot of time to flesh out the path forward.\n\"'Can we get there?' is important to determine first before we figure out how,\" Jackson said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She hopes to leave a legacy of helping students discover their passions and develop real-world skills so they can confidently build their future.\nKent Island High School Principal Dan Harding said, \"Mrs. Mamas exemplifies what it means to be an educator. She truly goes above and beyond and cares deeply about all of her students. With 29 years of unwavering dedication, she has empowered students to uncover their passions and gain real-world skills that will guide them far beyond the classroom. Her legacy at Kent Island High School will be one of inspiration, compassion, and lasting impact.\"\nMamas, still in shock days after the announcement, expressed overwhelming gratitude for being chosen to represent Queen Anne's County Public Schools as Teacher of the Year.\n\"Being a part of Kent Island High School has allowed me to pursue my passion, spread my wings, and try new things. I am appreciative of my department and my colleagues for not only supporting my projects but also for being incredible sounding boards as I puzzle out new ones. I am also appreciative of the decades of administrators who have allowed me to develop a growth mindset in my classroom in pursuit of hands-on authentic learning,\" Mamas said.\nShe added, \"I am so very fortunate that several students who have passed through my business and marketing pathway have reached success in their fields and continually come back to guide my current students and our program toward industry trends and standards.\"\nMamas also thanked the Teacher of the Year selection panel for their role in the process. \"The reflection necessary to complete the application helped transform my feelings, thoughts, and passion into something tangible. The questions afterward helped me focus on how my journey has progressed and why I love being a teacher, and during the interview process, their positive countenance and bearings made me feel truly seen and heard, it was empowering. A feeling that stayed with me and strengthened my belief that I am exactly where I am supposed to be\u2026doing exactly what I am meant to be doing,\" she said.\n\"There is so much we can accomplish together when we just get out of our own way, and embrace our skills, talents, and passions.

    "content": "University of Delaware asks state for $43.5 million to build Biden Hall, renovate labs\n\n April 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 654\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The University of Delaware is asking the state legislature for $43.5 million for capital projects, including building Biden Hall and renovating aging laboratories.\"These requests all support our overarching goal of meeting the educational goals of Delawareans who are coming to UD with greater financial need,\" UD President Dennis Assanis said Thursday during his annual capital budget request to the state legislature's Joint Capital Improvement Committee.\nThe committee, commonly referred to as the bond bill committee, hears capital budget requests from various state agencies and later will finalize the budget and send it to the full legislature for a vote in late June.\nUD is asking for $20 million to help build Biden Hall, an interdisciplinary social sciences building named after UD's most famous alumnus. The money is already in Gov. Matt Meyer's budget recommendation.\nUD first publicly disclosed plans for Biden Hall in January, but details remain scarce. Assanis revealed in his presentation to the bond bill committee that the building has been in the planning stages since 2018.\n\"We're still very much in the fundraising and planning stage of this project, so we have not set a timeline for construction yet,\" Assanis said. \"However, this demonstration of state support for the project will greatly help us in our efforts to continue to raise the necessary funds through philanthropy.\"\nOfficials have not disclosed where the building will be located or any details about it, other than it will be on the main Newark campus and will house the Joseph R. Biden, Jr. School of Public Policy & Administration and the Biden Institute.\nThe Biden Institute was created after Biden left the vice presidency in 2017, and it is currently located in the old Blue and Gold Club on Kent Way. Chaired by the former president's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, the Biden Institute hosts events, brings prominent speakers to campus and focuses on developing domestic public policy.\nUD's highly ranked School of Public Policy & Administration, which was renamed for Biden in 2018, offers undergraduate and graduate programs in leadership, public administration, public policy, public health, disaster management and related fields. It is currently headquartered in Graham Hall on Academy Street.\nBiden Hall \"will harness the latest technology to cultivate academic growth, interdisciplinary research collaborations, dialogue, and civil discourse, all of which are crucial to a flourishing democracy in the 21st century,\" a UD spokesman said earlier this year.\nUD is also asking the state for $20 million to address deferred maintenance of its laboratories and other buildings. Former Gov. John Carney recommended that amount in the budget he submitted days before leaving office, but Meyer reduced it to $14 million in his recommended budget.\nAssanis asked the bond bill committee to provide the full $20 million.\n\"We're hoping that you will consider providing that level of funding to help us maintain academic spaces, especially the laboratories that provide our students with hands-on learning in biology, chemistry, physics, engineering and other disciplines,\" he said. \"Maintaining modern facilities is a critical component in preserving our stature as a top-tier research institution, which is one of the most significant ways that UD serves the needs of our state.\"\nUD has struggled in recent years to keep up with maintenance, accumulating a backlog of $1.2 billion in needed repairs and upgrades.\nThe university is trying to reduce that backlog by consolidating space across campus, closing underused buildings and considering situations where it makes sense to construct a new building rather than continue to repair an old one. Still, Assanis said, state funding needs to be part of the equation.\n\"It is extremely difficult to find philanthropists who want to support replacement of HVAC systems or torn seats in a lecture hall,\" he said. \"State capital assistance is one element of our plan, and we're grateful for every dollar that you provide.\"\nThe remainder of UD's capital request is $3.5 million to renovate lab and classroom space in Georgetown and Lewes, which would boost the university's Associates in Arts Program in southern Delaware. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland wrestles with blow to the state schools budget\n\n April 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SASHA ALLEN Capital News Service | Section: Local News \n \n 733\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Maryland lawmakers are scrambling to figure out their education budget this spring after learning that $418 million they'd been expecting for public schools from the federal government may not come through.Senate President Bill Ferguson says the state had already spent approximately $300 million of the money and allocated the rest to school districts around the state when they learned that President Donald Trump's education department may not reimburse them as previously planned. The money was supposed to come from a special pandemic-era fund.\nThe funds are being spent by school districts to cover reading materials, after-school programming, and repairs for heating and air conditioning units, among other things.\nMid-Shore school districts were still unsure of the exact impacts to their budgets when asked for comment Thursday.\n\"At this time, we are waiting for details from MSDE (Maryland State Department of Education) regarding the final calculations and impact on funding for all Maryland school districts,\" Talbot County Public Schools said in a statement to the press. District officials said they expected to have more information by Monday, the final day of this year's state legislative session.\nSenate Democrats had already proposed cuts to the state's education plan, known as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. Now Republicans say it's even more important to make significant trims.\n\"We don't have an extra $300 million to spare, and it is foolish to double down on Blueprint spending when there are obvious accountability issues coupled with the concerns of our local school districts who are struggling to meet both the financial and the policy mandates,\" said Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Wicomico, Worcester).\nWord of the $418 million gap came late last week in a letter from U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, informing states that the fund's liquidation period would be coming to an end that day. Extensions of the pandemic-era fund, she said in the letter, were \"well past the period of performance\" and were \"not justified.\"\nThe letter specified that there may be exceptions on an individual basis, and Office of the Attorney General Spokesperson Jennifer Donelan said in a statement they are \"reviewing the matter and weighing our options.\"\n\"Protecting the state's schools and Maryland students is a top priority,\" read the statement.\nBut on Monday, Carozza introduced an amendment to the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, a bill aiming to reduce Blueprint funding, to pause implementation of the plan for the next two years.\n\"It's never been more clear that we need a pause in the Blueprint when it comes to affordability and implementation,\" Carozza said.\nTo balance the state's budget and bridge the structural deficit, the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act would make numerous cuts to the state's plan for hiking the investment in public education. While many Democrats still believe the Blueprint is necessary for the future of Maryland public schools, Republicans like Carozza are pushing for further cuts.\n\"There's no question that we've increased spending dramatically in education for the last 25 years, and our SAT scores are worse, our reading scores are worse, math is worse,\" said Sen. Justin Ready (R- Carroll, Frederick) on the Senate floor Tuesday. \"While we're not suggesting you want to cut education from where you are now, we are saying we should slow down how fast we're going and not raise taxes on working Marylanders for a little while longer.\"\nReady and numerous other Senate Republicans fought against tax increases in the budget bill, and many advocated instead to cut education even more.\nBut cuts have already been proposed. Senate amendments to the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act include pausing for four years the requirement for \"collaborative time,\" or the allocated period each day when teachers get for planning. The act would also maintain some reduction in funding for the Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports, a program providing mental health support in schools under the Blueprint.\nSome Senate Democrats, however, are in staunch disagreement with Republicans regarding the bill. Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George's, Anne Arundel) was the first to speak about the budget on the Senate floor Tuesday morning.\n\"We're not rolling over for the attacks on Maryland,\" Rosapepe said. \"We're protecting health care, we're protecting education, we're protecting public safety, we're protecting transportation \u2026 We're making the tax system more fair.\"\nLike Rosapepe, many senators mentioned the necessity of education funding. State Democrats pushed to protect funding for low-income students and English Language learners.\nThe Star Democrat Reporter Konner Metz contributed to this article. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Construction progress isn't quite at that mark, however.\n\"We'll be about 30% done at the end of the first phase in June,\" Shafer said during a meeting Monday. \"And the reason for that is a lot of front loading.\"\nThe renovation is a multimillion-dollar effort that includes around $27 million in county funding as well as state funds from Maryland's Interagency Commission on School Construction. Construction is being led by the Whiting-Turner Contracting Company.\nThe project is set to fully renovate the existing building and add around 16,000 square feet. There will be additional learning space for the school, as well as a Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers site located in the building.\nThe school's media center is moving to the center of the building, and the playground is also under renovation.\nConstruction, which began in summer 2024, is expected to take a couple years. The school was built in 1952 and last renovated in 1994.\nShafer noted the construction project started about 34 days late due to unforeseen septic system issues and permitting delays.\nHe credited Bill Stagg, the project manager appointed by the Talbot County Council, for preventing what could've been a significant delay.\n\"He was instrumental in making sure that this project even got started on time,\" Shafer said. \"If that would've hit about 40 days, it would've been pushed back a year.\"\nSchool operations have continued in the existing building this year during the first phase of work. Phase two of renovations will begin this summer once school ends, Shafer said.\n\"That is why you will see a front loading of expenses, making sure the supplies and equipment are here in place ready to hit the ground running,\" he said.\n\"That is a make-or-break time for this project. We have to be ready by the time kids come back in August.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Freedom of speech under assault on campuses\n\n April 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ROBERT C. KOEHLER | Section: Columns \n \n 1043\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Freedom of speech is kind of like eggs nowadays \u2014 too expensive. For Columbia University, the cost imposed on it by the Trump administration was suddenly $400 million in rescinded federal funding, at least if the speech was pro-Palestinian and critical of Israel.What choice did the school have, except, as Jennifer Scarlott writes, \"to appease the Trump administration by expelling, suspending and revoking the degrees of a growing number of students accused of peaceful protest and exercising their constitutional rights to free speech and assembly ...?\"\n\"The shameless capitulation of Columbia to government pressure,\" she goes on, \"is reflective of the corporate, neoliberal selling-out of academia. Academia, exemplified by Columbia University, has surrendered its proclaimed mission of intellectual independence and endeavor and the academic pursuit of knowledge and social advancement.\"\nCan you believe it? An academic clampdown on peace protests. Reading about this, I couldn't help but feel my own college days come back hard and strong, and I started reading the current news in a larger context.\nEducation isn't just a matter of absorbing a bunch of dead facts and certainties. As we gain \u2014 as we claim \u2014 our education, we bring our expanding awareness into the world we're entering. An essential part of the world during my own college years, back in the late '60s, was of course the Vietnam War. This war wasn't simply an abstraction; it was anxious to claim us as obedient participants.\nMany of us chose not to be obedient. We saw the hell and pointless horror of the war and decided that the only way we could participate in it was by standing against it, by ending it ... and, ultimately, by working to be create a world where war was no longer the unquestioned norm: a world, you might say, not defined by the lurking, soulless enemy (who must be killed), but by our connection to everyone and everything.\nYeah, this work is still in progress. War remains humanity's cancer \u2014 with no funding rescinded for its endless waging, at least not by the U.S. government. But five-plus decades ago, free speech did eventually bring the Vietnam War to an end and, indeed, precipitated an era of \"Vietnam syndrome,\" where the public basically opposed war in general. No small problem for the nation's warmongers.\nIt took almost two decades, but the U.S. eventually found itself an enemy equal in evil to the commies: the terrorists. Specifically, Muslim terrorists.\nIn 1991, President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Storm, aka, Gulf War I, a quick, brutal assault on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait. The Bush administration employed some highly effective public relations to push the war, including the false assertion that the evil Iraqis had ripped Kuwaiti babies from their hospital incubators and left them to die on the floor. The war lasted a little over a month, ending in the bombing and slaughter of retreating Iraqi troops, as well as civilians, along what became known as the Highway of Death.\nAfterward, Bush extolled the real victory his assault on Iraq had achieved, declaring: \"It's a proud day for America. And, by God, we've kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all.\"\nThe public was OK with war again. God bless America.\nAnd it's been at war, in various ways, ever since. This is also part of the context in which I ponder today's news about the Gaza genocide protests. Federal control over public relations is crucial, and if the protest movement is allowed to continue \u2014 and spread \u2014 sheerly because of the mass slaughter of Palestinian civilians, the funding of which is our declared national policy, this could be ... uh, problematic.\nIn the '60s, college campuses were at the hub of the nation's antiwar protests, with faculty members seriously involved as well, and the various college administrations across the country mostly remained aligned with and committed to the principle of free speech. That meant the military-industrial complex had a serious domestic enemy: those loud-mouth college critics and their ability to punch holes in the official government PR about its military initiatives.\nSo what's it going to do? Go total fascist and simply shut those students up by banning free speech? As appellate attorney Joseph Pace writes:\n\"There's a malign genius to the administration's approach. Trump and his enablers know they can't directly muzzle students or faculty without facing First Amendment lawsuits. To be clear, that doesn't mean the administration won't try. ICE has already begun arresting foreign student activists, and DOJ has signaled plans to charge protestors under federal counterterrorism laws. But the administration surely understands that most of those actions will be thwarted in the courts.\"\nSo start squeezing the college cash flow. That way, as Pace notes, it can force private college administrations to do the dirty work \u2014 banning protests, expelling protesters \u2014 legally. Pace quotes Trump strategist and former Heritage Foundation board member Christopher Rufo, who explained in a New York Times interview that the plan was to put the schools in a state of \"existential terror\" unless they went after the protesters.\nI would call this flipping the reality, a crucial aspect of war-related public relations. Here, for instance, is a small sliver of a United Nations report from Tom Fletcher, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, noting that Israel's latest ceasefire violation on March 17 resulted in hundreds of deaths. Furthermore:\n\"Since 2 March, Israeli authorities have halted the entry of all lifesaving supplies, including food, medicine, fuel and cooking gas, for 2.1 million people. Repeated requests to collect aid sitting at the Karem Shalom border crossing have also been systematically rejected, no further hostages have been released and Israel has cut power to southern Gaza's desalination plant, limiting access to clean water for 600,000 people.\"\nBut criticizing this is what the smugly powerful call antisemitic. The irony here, as Pace noted, is in the nature of the Trump administration itself, which he described as a \"den of antisemites.\" This is no doubt most flagrantly represented by Elon Musk, who infamously gave two Nazi salutes at a recent rally and, among much else, spoke at a right-wing convention in Germany where he lamented that \"Germany's real problem was 'too much focus on past guilt.'\"\nWe're on a dark and dangerous road to nowhere. The protests are keeping human sanity alive. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Four months in, Easton Middle staff, parents weigh in on cell phone pouches\n\n April 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Since December, Easton Middle School students have been placing their cell phones in locked pouches, a policy that's largely succeeding according to staff, though it hasn't quelled all parents' concerns.School principal Kelly Murdoch says students are no longer multi-tasking during teacher instruction by trying to talk to their friends on social media or texting apps. Overall, it has improved student engagement and restorative conflict management, she says.\n\"We've been intentional in trying to build those skills of having face-to-face interactions, because it's a skill that has been missing,\" Murdoch said.\nTalbot County followed suit of Caroline and Dorchester school districts, both of which began cell phone pouch pilot programs closer to the beginning of the school year. The districts acquired the pouches from the company Yondr.\nStudents place their phones in locked pouches at the start of the day, carry those pouches with them and unlock the pouches on a Yondr magnetic device when leaving.\n\"Initially, I was a little hesitant because of the safety issue that if something happened at school, I wanted to be able to get a hold of my child,\" said Carla Beavers, an EMS parent.\nBut Beavers said she was \"alleviated\" upon hearing from the district that emergency services professionals recommend students not use their phones during most emergencies. EMS also has \"portable\" unlocking devices, which Murdoch says allow students to unlock their phones if administrators deem it necessary during an emergency.\nPARENTS CHIME IN\nBeavers' son, a seventh grader, has left his phone at home since the new pouches were instituted. She says he's more focused on school instruction, and she hopes the pouch policy stays in place.\nHer son using the school phone to call her was \"seamless.\"\n\"He went to the office, he was allowed to make a phone call,\" Beavers said. \"I feel like the administrative team has it down.\"\nNicole Crosby, parent of an EMS eighth grader, has her son leave his phone at home too. He immediately brought his grades up, she said. But the decision to leave the phone at home stemmed from the pouches being \"ineffective,\" Crosby says.\n\"Having the knowledge that I do on what goes on in the eighth grade (and) what goes on in the middle school,\" Crosby said, \"I do not anticipate (the pouches) being very successful for the main reason of \u2014 we all had bets on how long it was going to take for the kids to break them and unlock them.\"\nMurdoch says Yondr has noted there are magnets out there that can be used to unlock their pouches, but the company warns it comes with the risk of damaging or breaking the phone. Murdoch said she hasn't seen students bring their own magnets yet.\nCrosby contends the policy would have better results with community investment. She says teachers are doing everything they can, but the ultimate responsibility falls on parents.\n\"They can't parent our children for us all the time,\" Crosby said. \"And if they don't have that support from us, then everything's going to be ineffective, unfortunately.\"\nMORE POUCHES TO COME?\nTCPS is leaving the door open to expanding the policy to other schools in the district, though not until next school year at the earliest. Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said opinions from members of her student advisory board are \"mixed.\"\n\"I have some students that feel like in high school, let's relinquish some of that independence and they should be able to have their phones,\" Pepukayi said.\nGabriella Streaker, a senior at Easton High and Board of Education student representative, believes the pouches could be useful at the high school level, particularly for ninth and tenth graders \u2014 though it wouldn't be a popular rule.\n\"Students can't really go anywhere without them. The phone is always with them,\" she said. \"And I often think the phone could be causing more issues than not.\"\nWhile others schools may or may not see the phone policy in coming years, the pouches have brought consistency and simplicity to Easton Middle's phone policy.\nTeachers, as well as administrators, are spending less time out of their days policing cell phones.\n\"It frees them up to do what they're supposed to do, which is be instructional leaders,\" Murdoch said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Schools face shortage of social workers\n\n April 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ELA JALIL Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 863\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON \u2014 Jaden Smith, a second-year master's student in social work at Howard University, is doing something not enough people do. He's working in a public high school, offering what he calls \"big brother love\" to his students.Smith, who started work at Bard High School Early College DC in Southeast Washington last fall while completing his degree, said he's now doing the same \"noble\" work that his mother did: serving as a school social worker.\nAnd thanks to a Howard program that aims to place social work students in schools in hopes that they'll work there full-time when they graduate, others are doing similar work. In the program's first two years, 22 second-year master's students have been placed in schools in the nation's capital to increase and diversify the school social work labor force, especially where they are needed the most.\nIt's called Project PRESS, which stands for Preparing Responsive and Effective School Social Workers. And the pilot program addresses a pressing need: a shortage of social workers in schools both in D.C. and nationwide.\nWhen Project PRESS started in 2023, there were 95 school social worker vacancies in D.C. public schools, said Sandra Jeter, an assistant professor of social work at Howard, at a panel about the project in December. And according to the School Social Work Association of America, no state in the union meets the recommended benchmark of one social worker for every 250 students.\nJeter, who launched Project PRESS with a five-year, $2.6 million federal grant, said social work programs at other universities could establish similar efforts to address the nationwide shortage of school social workers.\n\"I think PRESS can definitely be a model or just be an organization that offers this training to different universities that are developing social workers, whether they have a school social work focus or not,\" Jeter said. \"I think any university can adopt this model or work with me on expanding the model.\"\nIntensive training\nProject PRESS aims to motivate social work students to do something many of their predecessors have decided not to do: work in schools.\n\"The Project PRESS program is a really exciting thing to see to get students excited about the school social work profession,\" said Allie Perez, a representative of the School Social Work Association of D.C.\nThis yearlong program puts Howard social work students through two weeks of intensive training before they are placed at one of 11 participating schools. Students in the program receive a $10,000 stipend to ease some of the financial stresses of placement in a city school.\nSocial workers have different responsibilities than counselors and school psychologists. School social workers tend to work with specific students for long periods of time and create treatment or action plans.\n\"We do the mental health support, but we also take a more systemic view and we really focus on connecting people to resources and helping them remove barriers to those resources,\" Perez said.\nSchool counselors are more likely to focus on academic and career development compared to school social workers that are helping students with socio-emotional challenges.\nA school psychologist has the ability to diagnose students and perform psychosocial assessments, Jeter said.\nThe services that a school social worker provides, especially to underserved students, have a trickle-down effect on how a student performs, said Gloria Cain, an assistant professor at Howard's School of Social Work and a faculty member with Project PRESS.\n\"Social work is a discipline that really focuses on individuals within the context of their environment,\" Cain said.\nThe need\nProject PRESS focuses on sending students to D.C.'s Wards 7 and 8, historically Black and low-income areas located south of the Anacostia River.\nJeter said she believes these areas not only lack investment from the city but lack support rooted in the Black perspective that focuses on issues and trauma people often experience in majority Black and low-income communities.\nThe program focuses on culturally responsive training, which prepares program participants to engage with different student populations. It also teaches trauma-informed training, which promotes awareness of the systemic and individual trauma students carry with them so the student is not retraumatized.\nRacist incidents, poverty, food insecurity and homelessness are just some of the traumas students can carry with them that impact their performance in school. A main goal of the program is to interrupt these factors and use education as a gateway to success, Cain said.\nKyaus Washington, a 2024 graduate of Howard's master's of social work program, said it's important for social workers to know when students have experienced such traumas.\n\"Traumatic events happen to people and whenever you kind of understand that and try to understand from the person's perspective, then you're able to kind of tailor your modality to be effective based on the traumatic experience,\" Washington said.\nWashington works as a school-based expansion clinician at Lorraine H. Whitlock Elementary School in Ward 7. He noted negative experiences with therapists and the nation's long history of medical racism can lead to a sense of relief when a young Black student sees a Black social worker.\n\"People automatically have this shared sense of community with each other,\" Washington said. \"If they see, you know, me, a Black man walking into the school, my Black male students could automatically connect with me from that one shared identity.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Speakers ask to keep St. Mary's elementary music and arts intact\n\n April 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 705\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It was somewhat ironic that during Music and Art in our Schools Month that the heated and at times emotional topic of discussion during the March 26 St. Mary's school board meeting included discussion on scaling back such programs.On March 7, special area teachers were told about a three-year plan to transition from the current 10-day rotation cycle (A-Week, B-Week) to a four-day cohort model for elementary music and art.\nThe presentation noted that the inclusion of band, chorus and orchestra in the schedule offers third-, fourth- and fifth-graders a \"unique opportunity to be exposed to options provided in music education while minimizing disruptions to their academic learning.\" Currently, students participating in these ensembles are required to be pulled from core instruction two to four times per week.\nThe proposed change aims to \"enhance the quality of instruction, which is frequently interrupted by students moving in and out of the classroom for band, orchestra and chorus practices,\" according to the proposal.\nThe new model would allow students to engage in just one ensemble during their designated special area music time, replacing general music classes with participation in band, orchestra or chorus.\n\"Even if the budget was fully funded we would want to be talking about how we're delivering this in schools because we have inequity,\" Superintendent Scott Smith said. \"We need to have a different model than just kind of a random pullout for things. We need more structure.\"\nThirty minutes before the meeting started, the room was about 75% full and 36 speakers \u2014 ranging from educators, retired teachers, parents and students \u2014 voiced their concerns during the nearly 3\u00bd hour meeting.\n\"A significant concern of this proposed schedule is the lack of access it would cause for some of our our most vulnerable learners,\" Mechanicsville Elementary School media specialist Michelle Smith said.\n\"So what does a cohort student look like coming into the secondary realm?\" asked Megan Czechanski-Giannuzzi, who has been the band director at Leonardtown Middle School for the past 18 years. \"They're unprepared, they can't handle middle school, they can't understand the content that we instruct and they're struggling with transition and they just have meltdowns. I suggest we not become Montgomery County, firing one out of every three secondary art and music educators. We don't need to be like Calvert County. We don't need to be like Charles County. We need to be St. Mary's County and do our best every day.\"\nOne Town Creek Elementary School student, who plays the saxophone, said that with the new schedule, \"I would struggle to be focused on the amount of content [teachers] want me to learn in one sitting,\" and added that she hoped the board would \"listen to the teachers and sit with them to find a solution.\"\n\"My plea to the board is that we consider ways of providing our current music education offerings and opportunities with the same frequency because it allows students to expand their brains in fun and engaging ways,\" paraeducator Deborah Hines of Evergreen Elementary said. \"Music education not only creates a well-rounded curriculum, but also encourages students to participate and attend school regularly.\"\nGeorge Winslow, who taught in the county for 44 years, said, \"How can you possibly not keep it going? I have no idea, and I'm glad I'm not in your seats right now because the arts are important.\"\nThe presentation was first delivered to specials teachers last month and Smith said it was being presented publicly because, \"We figured it was only fair to present the presentation that was made and where we are in the process as we move forward.\"\nThe presenting panel said they have been meeting weekly and collecting feedback about the proposed change. The plan calls for all schools to adopt the model over the next three school years.\nGreen Holly Elementary has been using the cohort model the last 10 years and Park Hall is piloting the cohort model this year.\nStaff noted that data from Park Hall stated, \"The number of pullouts and transitions dropped in 25 band classes per week, 13 strings classes per week, and two chorus classes per week to zero pullouts,\" and added, \"reducing the number of transitions for students has helped reduce referrals, suspensions and ISI, helping to keep students in the learning environment.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County Board of Ed declares last day of school, discuss virtual instruction\n\n April 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ahmad Garnett agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The Caroline County Board of Education declared Tuesday, June 17, as the last day of the extended school year after inclement weather closures exceeded the four days allotted.The last day will be a half day for students and a full day for teachers.\nNext year, county schools will have three allotted inclement weather days. At the April 1 Board of Education meeting, district officials explored options for implementing virtual instruction should weather cause unexpected closures.\nBecause of the challenges presented by district officials, the board concluded it thinks the district will not be able to conduct virtual instruction on inclement weather days.\n\"The structure we tried to take with the presentation was a condensed version of some the requirements that the school system would have to meet if the county were to entertain virtual weather days,\" Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"We walked through some real tough spots for us to get to those points.\"\nInternet Connection and Google Meets\nThere are multiple factors Caroline County board of education most consider to conduct virtual inclement weather days. Including ensuring every student has a hotspot or wifi to participate in virtual learning.\nRobert Wielgosz, supervisor of technology, led the discussion on cellular service, offering points on the Kajeet program.\nKajeet was a hotspot used during the pandemic for students to connect to the internet in areas where wifi access was limited and not available.\nAccording to Wielgosz, when given the opportunity to use Kajeet, some students would use the hotspot for personal uses like video games and movies. This overloaded the hotspots and caused delays.\nThe estimate cost for Caroline County to provide the 700 needed Kajeet devices over five years would be about $736,000 for students and $35,000 for teachers.\nWielgosz also mentioned the need for Google Meet Breakout Rooms, which teachers use to conduct learning activities with groups in virtual classrooms. While this feature was available at no cost, it is no longer available in Caroline County's free Google plan.\n\"To get the feature back, it's going to cost Caroline County somewhere between $30,000 to $50,000 a year to get the premium Google aspect,\" Wielgosz said.\nMultilingual Learners, Special Education and Homelessness\nState law mandates districts \"ensure that all staff and students, including students with disabilities, homeless students, and English language learners, have the necessary devices at home for virtual education days, including access to Wifi.\"\nProviding equitable access to these services can be challenging during virtual instruction, district officials said.\nCaroline County has 576 multilingual learners, 569 individualized education program students and 116 students who experience homelessness. For these students, hands-on teacher engagement and preparation is required for proper learning.\n\"It's very hard to keep students engaged, especially for four hours of synchronous instruction,\" Erica McDonald, supervisor of special education, said. \"Without that in-person tangible motivating things that can keep them engaged during instruction, it can lead to increased frustration.\"\nProviding necessary technologies and translation services are also complicated by virtual instruction, the officials said.\nTeacher, staff negotiations\nSome district employees work on inclement weather days, and some staff members do not work and still get paid, district officials said.\nRequirements of the state say, \"during virtual inclement weather days the local school system shall offer public school employees who are not assigned to work during the virtual education day an opportunity to make up the lost work through other duties before the beginning of the next school year.\"\nThe district would be responsible for determining how this work would be made up.\nVirtual learning days require additional planning from teachers, which requires a negotiation with the teachers' union for proper pay.\n\"Our teachers work really hard. We all know are teachers work outside of hours. We have all come to accept that it comes with the job,\" Dr. Robert Willoughby, director of administrative services said. \"However, the law does say that we may negotiate with our teachers' union. They have a right to come to negotiate if there is extra work here we would like extra compensation for that.\"\nAfter going through the presentation, Simmons concluded it would be to hard for the county to pull off virtual inclement weather days.\n\"I don't see how as a county, with the resources we have right now, that this puts us in a great position to be able to hit all the marks to be able to pull this off effectively to meet all requirements,\" Simmons said. \n\n Copyright 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But now the project is facing an uncertain future following a notice from the U.S. Department of Education.\nIn a March 28 letter, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon announced effective the same day that the department would not be honoring extension requests for projects that were granted pandemic-era funds, such as the American Rescue Plan's Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief, or ESSER, program.\nThe move left the state with millions of dollars in funding at risk after it was previously granted an extension by the Biden administration.\nState Superintendent Carey Wright said in a press release that the rescinded reimbursements would put more than $400 million of Maryland schools' pandemic-era funding in jeopardy.\nAbout $305 million had already been spent and was awaiting reimbursement from the federal government, state officials said in March. About $112 million had not yet been paid out by the state, requiring school districts to halt ongoing work.\nAt a Board of Education meeting Wednesday, TCPS Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said the district isn't finding itself in a huge hole with regards to the reimbursement window unexpectedly closing.\nBut as far as the staff health center goes, the district is \"sort of dead in the water,\" she said.\nTCPS has paid $127,000 to Marathon for its work to date, Jones said. Remaining costs total to around $1.4 million.\n\"Those are costs that have not yet been spent, but we don't have authority to spend them,\" Jones said.\nJones told board members the district contacted Marathon, and the company quit work on the project.\nThe board agreed to revisit the question of funding the health center at a future meeting. Jones said there are multiple funding options at the district's disposal, including tapping into fund balance.\n\"We should really figure out how to make this work, and we should fund this,\" Board President Emily Jackson said.\nBoth Caroline County Public Schools and Dorchester County Public Schools have been fully reimbursed for all of their ESSER-related spending, according to school officials.\n\"We expended our funding within the timeline that was originally stated,\" CCPS Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"We considered (extending), but we did not end up needing it.\"\nSimmons and Dorchester County assistant superintendent Jodi Colman each said the March 28 letter did raise concerns for the status of federal funding in general.\nIn the letter, McMahon wrote the department \"will consider an extension to your liquidation period on an individual project-specific basis.\"\nWednesday, TCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi noted the state has submitted an extension request to the U.S. Department of Education.\nJones said she imagines there will have to be \"some allowances for costs that have actually been incurred\" made by the federal government.\n\"There are literally schools that are in the middle of some sort of construction, capital improvement, and you can't leave a gym half built,\" Jones said. \"You can't leave an HVAC system half-installed.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland will slow \u2013 not stop \u2013 its investment in schools\n\n April 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SASHA ALLEN Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 377\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Maryland lawmakers passed a bill this week revising the state's expensive education reform plan, making marginal cuts instead of the more dramatic rollbacks proposed earlier this year.The bill, initially introduced by Gov. Wes Moore in January, reforms the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. Freezes to annual funding increases supporting students in poverty, special education students and English language learners were among the most controversial of Moore's proposals.\nBut as the bill made its way through the General Assembly, members of the House and Senate pushed to fully implement and fund programs they deemed most necessary under the Blueprint.\nAnd when it passed Monday, it had been watered down to include only a few program changes and less sweeping budgetary cuts.\n\"At a time when the federal government is trying to eliminate the Department of Education and gut funding for schools from Mount Maryland to the Eastern Shore,\" Moore said Tuesday, \"we've delivered the largest single investment in K-12 education in the history of our state.\"\nFederal cuts left the legislature searching for ways to cut funding \u2014 especially after news from the federal government that up to $418 million in state education spending would not be reimbursed as previously expected.\nBut lawmakers decided that funding increases under the Blueprint for special education students, English language learners and schools experiencing high rates of poverty were too crucial to pause.\nThe most major cuts targeted the Blueprint's collaborative time initiative, requiring that teachers spend a portion of their workday planning. For the next three years, schools will not be required by the state to meet the priorly established teacher planning thresholds. Funding increases will also be paused for fiscal years 2027 and 2028.\n\"I think the bill that passed is fine, I mean, I think it makes some relatively modest changes,\" said Sen. Jim Rosapepe, a Democrat representing Prince George's and Anne Arundel Counties. \"I don't think it's a big deal. I think it's a little deal.\"\nBut the bill received \"no\" votes from Republican lawmakers. While much of the discourse on the bill focused on the decision to raise taxes rather than pausing more Blueprint initiatives, Sen. Jack Bailey, a Republican representing Calvert and St. Mary's Counties, said he voted against the bill because of the financial burden that it might place on counties. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He has been a teacher in Caroline County since 2009.\n\"It's an absolutely amazing feeling,\" Buffenmyer said of winning. \"It's an amazing county and the greatest group of students in the entire world. I'm just absolutely thrilled and so happy for everything that's happened this year and everything that's going to be happening going forward.\"\nWhile Buffenmyer is excited about the award, his main focus is his students, and he hopes to continues to see them walk across the stage.\n\"(The award) is vindication for the hours, the tears, the long nights, the everything that we've put in behind the scenes,\" Buffenmyer said. \"But, it doesn't change anything, like, students are still number one. They always will be number one. The best thing is seeing those kids walk across that stage, seeing them in the community, seeing them be successful in their life, like that's the real reward.\"\nBuffenmyer will go on to represent Caroline County in the state's Teacher of the Year contest, where Simmons thinks he will be an excellent representative of the district.\n\"It's going to happen, We have incredible teachers,\" Simmons said of winning the state Teacher of the Year. \"We are one of 24 school districts. They're awesome ones everywhere else as well. At some point Caroline's time will be there.\"\nMarshall, Support Staff of the Year\nMarshall is the head custodian at Greensboro Elementary School. He has only been with Caroline County Public Schools for three years.\n\"I was surprised, a little shocked. I wasn't expecting it being a fairly new employee of the county,\" Marshall said about winning the award.\n\"I couldn't ask for a better group of people to work with. They make it enjoyable to come to work. I've came from other job, jobs that just wear you down, and it's a good experience to be here. The kids, seeing them every day and how they enjoy it, it's just a pleasure.\"\nWhile Marshall appreciates the award, he said regardless of winning, he plans to put his all in for the students at Greensboro Elementary.\n\"I appreciate it,\" Marshall said. \"I've told my supervisors that no matter what, this doesn't change who I am. We don't do this for awards. It's it's for the school. It's our job. It's what we're supposed to be doing.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Students place their phones in locked pouches at the start of the day, carry those pouches with them and unlock the pouches with a magnetic device when leaving.\nAdministrators have sung the praises of the new phone rules, citing an improvement in student engagement and a decrease in bullying.\n\"I can't imagine discontinuing it,\" Board Vice President Amy Dodson said Wednesday.\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi estimated it will cost the district around $9,000 to purchase pouches for St. Michaels Middle and replacements for some worn pouches at Easton Middle.\nHIGH SCHOOL DEBATE\nBoard members voiced differing opinions on whether to introduce pouches at the high school level.\nPresident Emily Jackson said she wants to see more data on the effectiveness of the pouches, suggesting the district monitor this year's sixth graders through the next two years for behavioral and academic trends.\nBoard member Ann O'Connor argued pouches should be instituted in the high schools.\n\"We all know the effects of the cell phone and how it adversely affects our students, so why wouldn't we?\" O'Connor said.\n\"This is a trial program,\" Jackson said. \"I just want to see more before I feel comfortable saying yes definitely.\"\nBoard member Karla Wieland-Cherry pushed back on putting the pouches in the high school next year, stating schools need to work on managing students' behaviors.\n\"By the time this sixth grade class reaches the high school, it will already be an expected behavior,\" Wieland-Cherry said.\nChief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said purchasing pouches for high school students could cost around $38,000.\nO'Connor said she doesn't think the money to bring the program to the high schools is an issue. She emphasized the impacts that phone use and constant notifications have on the younger generation.\n\"Isn't our job to educate and take away all these distractions?\" O'Connor said. \"It is a distraction, we know this. There are studies, there is data.\"\nWieland-Cherry responded, saying it's hard to stop an addiction like cell phone usage cold turkey. \"They do need time to adjust,\" she said.\nJackson said she's open to considering an expansion into high school in the future, but not for next year. She said there's added nuance to the situations high schoolers face, such as those who are parents, care for younger siblings or work jobs.\n\"I look at high schoolers and think there's a major difference between a freshman and a senior,\" Jackson said.\nDuring discussion, O'Connor motioned for the pouch program to be extended to high schools in the district. Board member Deborah Bridges joined her in voting yes, but the remaining five members voted the measure down. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland State of Reading Report: 'time for a comeback after a decade of decline'\n\n April 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Andrea Grabenstein agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 469\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BALTIMORE \u2014 Maryland's schools are showing signs of progress in reading achievement, but a new report underscores that a deep and lasting crisis remains.The Maryland READS \"State of Reading in Maryland 2025: It's Time for a Comeback After a Decade of Decline\" report reveals that although incremental gains have been made among fourth-grade students, 67% still cannot read at a proficient level \u2014 a figure that mirrors the stagnation seen in eighth grade.\n\"We are still facing a reading crisis,\" said Trish Brennan-Gac, executive director of Maryland READS. \"Our state is dealing with a budget crisis, including unexpected federal education cuts. Equally concerning, our report shows far too many students are not able to read proficiently.\"\nBrennan-Gac's remarks come as state and local leaders attempt to reverse a long-term decline in literacy.\nMaryland READS is a nonprofit working to improve reading instruction in the state. The organization partners with government officials and community leaders to create better policies based on research it conducts.\nThe report, released amid a backdrop of rising education spending \u2014 up 37% to nearly $18,900 per pupil since 2013 \u2014 provides a snapshot of Maryland's progress compared with national trends. While the state has nudged ahead of some peers in its national ranking for fourth grade reading scores, nearly two thirds of children continue to struggle.\n\"Reading is an investment,\" Brennan-Gac said. \"Results will not come to fruition unless everyone works together.\"\nThe executive director stressed strong reading skills are critical not only for academic success, but for long-term outcomes like career readiness and reducing chronic absenteeism. \"If a child can't read, they feel stupid and don't want to come to school,\" Brennan-Gac said.\nBased on data provided by Maryland READS using the Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program reading scores to assess the health of reading instruction in individual districts, Mid-Shore learners fall below 50% proficiency in English Language Arts with the exception of students in Queen Anne's County.\nThe 2024 ELA Proficiency rates are:\nCaroline: 45.5%.\nDorchester: 33.7%.\nKent: 41.2%.\nQueen Anne's: 58.5%\nTalbot: 47.3%.\nState leaders have taken steps toward a solution by prioritizing teacher training and the development of literacy coaching programs. However, Brennan-Gac criticized recent legislation for \"missing the mark\" by not providing adequate funding for literacy coaches \u2014 a move she argues is essential for \"translating research-based practices into everyday classroom instruction.\"\nIn addition to bolstering teacher support, the report calls for a comprehensive, community-driven approach to literacy. It highlights a need for creating reading ecosystems that extend beyond the classroom and address factors such as excessive screen time \u2014 a growing barrier to the \"deep reading\" it says underpins comprehension and critical thinking.\n\"Over the last year, state leaders have led by taking action, but we need a comprehensive, community-driven effort,\" Brennan-Gac said. \"My hope is the legislator will look at his data and start to ask why and, next year, have a different mindset.\" \n\n Copyright 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "High school graduation rate reaches seven-year high\n\n April 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Erin Sjostedt Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 510\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland's high school graduation rate climbed to 88% in 2024, reaching its highest point since 2017, according to the Maryland State Department of Education. The increase of nearly 2 percentage points over the previous year marks a significant recovery following pandemic-era declines.The 2024 data from MSDE shows significant gains among student groups that have historically faced barriers to graduation. Hispanic students saw their graduation rate rise over seven percentage points, while multilingual learners experienced a dramatic increase of over 10%.\n\"Last year was the largest year-over-year gain of any student group, and I think that's a testimony to targeted, sustained supports that are making the difference,\" said Theresa Timmons Parrott, an MSDE official focused on multilingual education. \"It's a step in the right direction, but it's not the finish line.\"\nTalbot County boasted a graduation rate of 95%, seven points above the state average.\nCaroline and Dorchester counties both fell below the state average with rates of 87.5 and 84.4, respectively.\nStatewide, female students continued to graduate at higher rates than male students, and white and Asian students graduated at higher rates than their Black and Hispanic peers. Students with disabilities graduated at a rate of 69%, still well below the statewide average. Economically disadvantaged students' graduation rate increased slightly from 2023, graduating at a rate of 82%.\nThe graduation rate report comes as Maryland begins to implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a landmark education reform law that aims to expand early childhood education, increase college and career readiness and close equity gaps.\nSeveral of the strategies outlined in the Blueprint \u2014 including community school models and increased funding for English language learners \u2014 align with areas of progress highlighted in the 2024 data.\n\"If you dig down into the Blueprint, it really lays the foundation for the strategies we're seeing pay off,\" Parrott said. She attributes a large portion of the progress made to broaden access to early childhood education, target funding for multilingual learners, and mandate college and career readiness pathways by tenth grade.\nWhile the Blueprint for Maryland's Future has driven recent graduation gains, lawmakers enacted adjustments this year due to a projected $3 billion budget shortfall. The Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, passed in April 2025, includes a three-year delay in implementing teacher collaborative time and provisions to freeze increases in funding if state revenues significantly decline.\nStill, regional disparities persist. While some districts reported graduation rates above 90%, others, particularly in rural counties on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland, sit at 80% and below. Education advocates say these gaps underscore the need for continued investment and monitoring.\n\"This is great news for Maryland,\" State Superintendent of Schools Carey Wright said in a press release from MSDE. \"When we set high standards, deliver strong instruction, and invest in proven supports, our students show that they will exceed expectations.\"\nAs the 2025 graduating class enters its final year, educators and policymakers are cautiously optimistic. The latest data suggests that Maryland's post-pandemic recovery is underway, however state education officials say it will require long-term commitment to equity, funding and student support services to maintain. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "College built as an economic engine for Shore\n\n April 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CLIFFORD P. COPPERSMITH | Section: Columns \n \n 823\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Nearly 60 years after its inception, Chesapeake College remains at the center of regional progress and innovation. The college's role and mission were highlighted earlier this month when Maryland's top leaders gathered in our Health Professions and Athletics Center.Gov. Wes Moore held his cabinet meeting on our Wye Mills campus, part of an initiative to travel to every corner of the state. After that meeting, Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller and Secretary of the Maryland Higher Education Commission Sanjay Rai toured Chesapeake's skilled trades labs and new mobile welding trailer, to learn about the college's response to local economic and workforce needs and to meet some of our students.\nIn bringing his cabinet to our campus, Gov. Moore reinforced the college's role as a regional hub, fueling progress for the Shore. We discussed our shared priorities, like connecting Marylanders to jobs, ensuring student success and creating an equitable and robust economy.\nOpen-access institutions and workforce champions like Chesapeake are helping to give Marylanders a hand up to better lives \u2014 and that has always been what we're about. Conceived during the Truman Commission, the concept of the community college is part of the American Dream. As individuals set their own goals and choose their own paths to success, community colleges provide the guidance and knowledge for achieving success.\nDuring a time of rapid change in the 1960s, Eastern Shore leaders joined together to found the college, creating a lasting resource available to all residents of our region. With foresight and a commitment to working together, the founders of Chesapeake created an institution designed to respond to the full spectrum of human interest and ability and to offer something to everyone, from transfer-bound college students to industry professional seeking new certifications to retirees enriching their lives.\nThough milestones such as the Wye Mills groundbreaking and opening of the first buildings on campus in 1967 and the first commencement in 1969 would follow, the charter date of December 1965 marks the official beginning of Chesapeake College.\nRemarkably, Chesapeake is still the only community college in Maryland with five support counties \u2014 a geographical area comprising nearly one fifth of the state's landmass. We're grateful for the support we enjoy from our diverse and beautiful counties, our many and varied business partners and the whole of our service community. That support has enabled this institution to endure for 60 years, in turn supporting Eastern Shore residents in finding meaningful education and employment in a wide variety of political, economic and social changes.\nEven now that community-building and economy-building role continues at Chesapeake, through partnerships with county leaders, local school systems, generous donors, friends and more. In the past five years, I am proud to say that our faculty and staff have supported students to higher graduation and transfer rates; we recently ranked second in the state among community colleges, based on a study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia.\nLooking forward, we have ambitious plans to develop cutting-edge workforce training facilities, to demonstrate that trades jobs are the \"new tech\" jobs and help keep Eastern Shore talent right here at home on this beautiful peninsula \u2014 not just the \"land of pleasant living\" but a landscape where we see abundant personal and professional opportunities.\nEveryone here at Chesapeake is proud to serve our students and region, believing we are one of the most important resources to residents of the Mid-Shore and watching generations of our graduates serving their communities and giving back every day.\nAcquiring skills and achieving academic success are key components of a college experience, but personal growth can contribute just as much to a student's life.\nOur students develop critical thinking skills and learn how to make intellectual and interpersonal connections. Students get to know and collaborate with classmates of different ages, backgrounds and experiences. They consider the biggest challenges facing society today, and they learn to find common ground and work toward a greater good.\nThese experiences can't be assessed with test scores, grades or certifications. They are, however, critical for people who are able to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing world.\nI can't predict what the next 60 years will bring for higher education. The world will change in ways that we can only imagine now. Chesapeake College, as always, will adapt to those changes and continue to prepare our students for what's next in their lives as we contribute to the vitality of our community.\nI hope you will help us celebrate the 60th birthday of Chesapeake College. We're planning a variety of events on campus to mark this special occasion, and you can learn more about our plans at chesapeake.edu. First up is the dedication of our new mobile welding lab on April 24 at 1:30 pm on our Wye Mills campus. If you can't visit us then, look for our mobile lab in the service area as we take our skilled trades training into the community, striving as always to meet our students wherever they are. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's Talbot County's third center, following locations in Easton and St. Michaels.\nJudy Centers are funded by the state and are a focus of The Blueprint, Maryland's expansive initiative to fund education. Last October, the state awarded a grant to Tilghman Elementary School to create one.\nThe centers provide workshops, family support services, enrichment and learning activities, and more for children up to five years old, according to the Maryland Department of Education. They provide most services for free for families in the school district where a center is located.\n\"Learning begins long before a child enters the classroom,\" Talbot County Public Schools Judy Center Supervisor Amy Walstrum said Wednesday. \"It starts at birth.\"\n\"The earliest years are the most critical years, and the most influential people during those years are the child's first and most important teachers, who are their families,\" Walstrum added.\nJulian has 25 years of experience as a Judy Center coordinator in Maryland, including in Queen Anne's County and recently at the St. Michaels site. The new Tilghman Island Judy Center is paramount to providing local families with resources, Julian said.\n\"We had (Tilghman Island) families that were coming to our St. Michaels (site), and then due to funding, we had to tell them they couldn't come anymore,\" Julian said. \"So we lost half our families. So when we put in for this grant, we were blessed to get it here.\"\nJulian says in a way, the Tilghman Island community has been left behind and put at a disadvantage. The elementary school only has about 100 students, community resources are limited and families have to make 20-minute drives to get to a grocery store, she said.\nBut the Judy Center is a significant step toward closing that gap for local families.\n\"Because we're such a small school, we really were surprised when we did get the grant,\" Julian said. \"And the families were just thrilled.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some of these girls are not imagining futures for themselves that are actually in reality open to them.\"\nBAAM, located on Jowite Street in Easton, is a nonprofit that aims to provide educational and social spaces for at-risk and minority youth. Executive Director Dina Daly said Ryan's gift will allow the organization to expand its program out to girls at the middle-school level.\nDaly called Ryan's said BAAM will be putting some of the money toward the girls program and investing the rest.\n\"We will make these funds last us beyond just today, and tomorrow and the next day,\" Daly said. \"We could actually spend it all, but then it wouldn't leave a legacy.\"\nThe $1 million contribution is the largest one-time gift to BAAM's programming, Daly said, and is one of the largest overall monetary donations made in recent history.\nDaly pitched the idea to Ryan this winter and was excited when Ryan jumped on board. Ryan said the theme of mentorship was a driving force behind her decision to donate.\nRyan, 75, is a transgender woman. She said the mentors and women who assisted her during her gender transition inspired her to fund a program in which women will be mentoring young girls.\n\"That's very powerful to me because I've experienced it firsthand,\" Ryan said. She added that Daly's leadership and success with the nonprofit make her confident the money will be put to good use.\n\"Dina is a force of nature,\" Ryan said. \"She's an amazing human being. She's very quiet in most circumstances. But she's an incredible, active listener. When you talk with her, it's like you're the only person in the world to her right at that moment.

    "content": "\u2018Catastrophic\u2019: Could Trump 'defund' Head Start preschools program?\n\n April 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: National \n \n 889\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Jennie Mauer is concerned about a looming \"chaotic disaster.\"Mauer is executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association.\nHead Start is a federal program offering free preschools to close to 800,000 lower-income kids nationwide and dates to the 1960s.\nMauer and other early education advocates are worried about current Head Start funding and the program's future with President Donald Trump's austerity efforts and a draft White House budget showing no funding for the $12.1 billion preschool effort.\nIn some rural and poorer communities, Head Start can be one of the only childcare options for lower income and working class families.\n\"There are many places where Head Start fills a critical void,\" said Mauer, whose group represents preschools across Wisconsin that receive funding under Head Start.\nEarlier this month, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said the Trump administration has slowed $943 million in existing Head Start funding that goes directly from the federal government to local providers across the country.\nMurray said in a statement the \"slow-walk' of money prompted one Head Start provider serving 400 kids in eastern Washington state to temporarily close earlier this month.\n\"Before our very eyes, Donald Trump is defunding Head Start,\" said U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin.\nShe said the Trump administration has delayed as much as $35 million in approved Head Start disbursements in Wisconsin so far this year.\nMauer said 40 Head Start providers in Wisconsin are budgeted $258 million annually to serve approximately 15,000 kids.\nShe said current DOGE efforts \u2014 including a short-lived spending freeze right after Trump took office in January and downsizing at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services \u2014 have providers jumping through more hoops to get payrolls approved and the families they serve are concerned about current and future funding.\n\"It's chaotic,\" she said.\nMauer and other Head Start backers say the program is the only thing keeping some areas of the country from becoming \"child care deserts\" with few (or sometimes no) affordable daycare options.\nKaren Filipovich, executive director of the Montana Head Start Association, said there is uncertainty about the War on Poverty-era program.\n\"I think right now there is a lot of wait and see,\" Filipovich said.\nHead Start funding in Montana totals $62 million annually. Filipovich said there are 22 programs, including on Native American reservations, serving more than 3,900 kids.\nShe said many areas of Montana, which has a population of just over 1.1 million people, are already childcare deserts with few affordable options.\nThe average cost of child care is $1,000 per month in Montana, Tennessee, Florida and other states and can run even more in other states, including Ohio ($1,400 per month), Maryland ($1,600 per month) and California ($1,800), according to the Economic Policy Institute.\nFilipovich doesn't think state governments have the financial bandwidth to take over funding.\n\"We are already struggling with the capacity to take care of kids,\" she said.\nHead Start advocates said the cuts or an elimination would have its economic toll, making it harder for working class parents and grandparents to afford child care and get jobs.\nFilipovich said those families are also concerned about other Trump cuts and potential changes for Medicaid, Social Security and other safety net programs.\nTrump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) austerity programs and congressional Republican efforts have frequently mirrored Project 2025.\nThe policy blueprint calls for Head Start to be eliminated, saying the program \"is fraught with scandal and abuse\" and citing a 2020 federal Inspector General's report that said as many as 'one in four' Head Start providers had problems with child supervision and others were not promptly reporting abuse or mistreatment allegations.\n\"Between October 2015 and May 2020, 12 % of recipients received an adverse finding for child abuse,\" the 2020 federal inquiry found.\nIn March, the Trump administration announced it was looking to cut 20,000 jobs at HHS to bring the agency headcount down to 62,000 employees.\nThe austerity efforts have resulted in the closure of six of HHS's 10 regional offices, including in Chicago, New York and Seattle.\nThe agency \u2014 which has said its restructurings will improve efficiencies and use of tax dollars \u2014 has not yet responded to a request for comment on Head Start funding.\nWanda Minick, executive director of the Florida Head Start Association, said the government-funded preschool program also offers hearing and vision screenings as well as meal and nutrition programs for low-income kids.\n\"At a time when we need solutions to workforce shortages, early education access, and economic disparities, cutting Head Start would be a step backward,\" Minick said.\nFilipovich said Head Start staff are also worried about the future of the program and their jobs.\nHead Start preschool programs, which serve infants and toddlers up to age 5, employ more than 250,000 staff across the country, according to the National Head Start Association (NHSA).\nThat includes 1,300 workers in Montana and close to 11,600 in Florida.\nNHSA has called a federal defunding of Head Start \"catastrophic\" for working class and low-income families.\nLast year, the Biden administration issued a new rule raising Head Start teacher pay \u2014 which ranged on average between $35,000 and $40,000 nationally \u2014 by approximately $10,000.\nRepublicans pushed back on the pay increases, with U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, saying \"the effort smells like an attempt to form Head Start educators into a unionized political block.\"\nThe Trump administration \u2014 which has reversed a number of policies from the previous White House \u2014 has not yet taken any action on Biden's Head Start pay rule. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The increase of nearly 2 percentage points over the previous year marks a significant recovery following pandemic-era declines.The 2024 data from the education department shows significant gains among student groups that have historically faced barriers to graduation. Hispanic students saw their graduation rate rise over seven percentage points from 2023-2024, while multilingual learners experienced a dramatic increase of over 10%.\n\"Last year was the largest year-over-year gain of any student group, and I think that's a testimony to targeted, sustained supports that are making the difference,\" said Theresa Timmons Parrott, a state education official focused on multilingual education. \"It's a step in the right direction, but it's not the finish line.\"\nAnne Arundel County Public Schools reported a graduation rate of 89%, two percentage points above the state average. North County High School in Glen Burnie, a Title I school, achieved a 7% increase in its graduation rate.\nBob Mosier, chief communications officer for Anne Arundel County Public Schools, said \"every student group is different, and so it's providing students with what it is that they need on an individual basis to be successful.\"\n\"A nearly full-point jump in overall graduation rate is a very significant accomplishment,\" Mosier said. \"We also had six schools that increased by two percentage points or more.\"\nStatewide, female students continued to graduate at higher rates than male students, and white and Asian students graduated at higher rates than their Black and Hispanic peers. Students with disabilities graduated at a rate of 69%, still well below the statewide average. Economically disadvantaged students' graduation rate increased slightly from 2023, graduating at a rate of 82%.\nThe graduation rate report comes as Maryland begins to implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a landmark education reform law that aims to expand early childhood education, increase college and career readiness and close equity gaps. Several of the strategies outlined in the Blueprint \u2014 including community school models and increased funding for English language learners \u2014 align with areas of progress highlighted in the 2024 data.\n\"If you dig down into the Blueprint, it really lays the foundation for the strategies we're seeing pay off,\" Parrott said. She attributes a large portion of the progress made to broaden access to early childhood education, target funding for multilingual learners, and mandate college and career readiness pathways by 10th grade. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You are truly the heart of this initiative,\" she said.\nWhether finishing up a rookie year or going strong with several seasons under their belts, through the appreciation dinner each and every volunteer was lauded by name for their commitment to coaching and mentoring local children.\nFinishing out her first year of coaching and receiving a certificate of recognition was Kimberly Kight who, volunteering at Centreville Elementary School with kindergarteners, considered the experience immensely rewarding.\n\"I love it. The kids' eyes just light up when you enter the classroom,\" she said, her own eyes sparkling.\nVolunteers also included Fred Sheriff, who was recognized for his 14 years of coaching at Church Hill Elementary. Sheriff said he strives to make every session fun and engaging and matches his iconic bowtie with the corresponding pillar colors every month.\nEvery classroom session brings forth a sense of accomplishment for a brighter tomorrow, \"And you know you're helping,\" he said.\nMore information about QAC Character Counts can be found at www.peopleofcharacter.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat.

The event, held on the second floor of Hodson Hall, featured renowned speaker Heather Mizeur, who delivered the lecture \"Disagreement is Democratic.\"\nThe lecture, free to the public, included an introduction to the new PoliTalks leadership: co-presidents Charlotte Schurman and Grace Walsh. \"We feel confident in our team to take the group forward,\" Schurman said during a catered meal and Q&A session following Mizeur's discussion.\nSchurman and Walsh are continuing the tradition of PoliTalks: to provide a safe, respectful forum for political education and conversation.\nHook reflected on the club's success during a politically charged climate, noting that he was pleased to see people with differing views engage in peaceful discussions about polarizing issues during the Trump administration.\nMizeur, a former Maryland state delegate, candidate for Congress, and CEO and founder of WeAreOne Alliance, led these discussions. This was her second time giving the lecture. She discussed the guiding principles she learned while reaching across the aisle and campaigning.\nJust as she did at the Toll Science Center on Oct. 17, 2024, Mizeur introduced her mnemonic device: **RESPECTFUL**, which stands for Reciprocity, Engagement, Sovereignty, Pause, Equanimity, Curiosity, Trust, Freedom, Unhook, and Listen.\nIn this session, she focused on the \"S\" \u2014 **Sovereignty**.\nMizeur defined sovereignty as \"the ability to stand in your own agency.\" She explained that how we respond to political disagreements, while maintaining self-control and understanding, is key to sovereignty.\nMizeur stated that the nation's collective sovereignty is currently under assault. She criticized the Trump administration for trampling due process and weaponizing fear and control, leading to the dehumanization of people.\n\"The initial response to these policies,\" Mizeur said, \"is to react with fear and frustration, instead of responding with sovereignty, which is a conscious choice rooted in integrity.\"\nSovereignty, Mizeur explained, is a calming force that leads us to a different path, one that cannot be legislated or controlled.\n\"It's not earned, but inherited,\" Mizeur said.\nShe offered lessons on how to reconnect with one's own inherited sovereignty.\nMizeur emphasized that sovereignty does not mean being a doormat. It requires setting boundaries, practicing a firm \"yes\" and \"no,\" and avoiding separation from others, which leads to isolation and despair. She encouraged practices like journaling, speaking with a friend or partner, and engaging in joyful activities to help individuals maintain sovereignty.\nMizeur also emphasized the importance of listening to the body's warnings and stepping back from social media to detox and nourish oneself.\n\"Sovereignty is a practice, not a switch you turn on and off when needed,\" Mizeur added.\nShe said practicing these principles brings deeper joy, freedom, and can spark real change in hearts and lives.\nThe discussion continued over a catered dinner, where guests of all ages discussed how to apply these principles in their own lives. Some shared stories of losing friends or family members over political differences and blocking people on social media. Tensions over political debates had surfaced in families.\nOne attendee suggested that protests, such as the \"Hands Off Rally,\" should include what participants are fighting for, in addition to what they oppose, emphasizing the positive.\nA few attendees remarked that they no longer view people with opposing views as \"enemies.\" A central lesson from Mizeur's talk was to lead with curiosity and learn from everyone, regardless of their political affiliation.\nOthers acknowledged that life experiences can lead to differing viewpoints, and sometimes, religion plays a role in those differences.\nOne woman pointed out issues on which everyone could agree, such as the need for more jobs and affordable housing.\nHook, who founded PoliTalks after witnessing the need for peaceful discussions on campus following a Washington College lecture by conservative speaker Robert George, expressed his satisfaction with the club's success. George had cut his speech short on Sept. 7, 2023, due to protests.\n\"This is the best possible way we could have ended with the club,\" Hook said.\nHe thanked everyone involved, especially Mizeur, for her nonprofit work in coalition building through community partnerships. \"Heather brings a unique narrative to the conversation around political dialogue that we believe is important for our community to hear,\" Hook said.\nFor those who missed Mizeur's talks, they can sign up for her newsletter and receive information about her 2025 programming at [https://www.weareonealliance.org/](https://www.weareonealliance.org/).\nWhat's next for PoliTalks under new leadership?Schurman noted that environmental justice is a strong focus across campus. She plans to invite Serena C. McIlwain, Maryland Secretary of the Environment, for a future lecture.\nAs they call for more student involvement, PoliTalks plans to hold monthly meetings.\nSeveral members of the Chestertown government attended the event, including Mayor David Foster and Council Member Sheila Austrian of Ward 1. Austrian found the discussion eye-opening and thanked the college and PoliTalks for reaching out to the community in such a meaningful way. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As we look ahead to the next chapter in the university's leadership, President Assanis' legacy of purpose-driven, positive change will forever have an impact on UD's continued future of institutional excellence. We wish him and Eleni nothing but the best for their future.\"\nAssanis' resignation follows a string of high-profile departures in recent months. John Long, executive vice president and chief operating officer, is retiring this week, and Mary Remmler, senior vice president and chief financial officer, resigned last week. Athletic Director Chrissi Rawak left earlier this year.\nIt also comes at a fraught time for higher education institutions nationwide, which have seen funding cuts and other threats from the Trump administration.\nA record of campus growth\nAssanis came to UD in 2016, replacing former president Patrick Harker. Before coming to Delaware, the native of Greece was provost at Stony Brook University and had spent most of his academic career as an engineering professor and administrator at the University of Michigan.\nIn 2021, the UD Board of Trustees announced that it had extended Assanis' contract through 2026. With a total compensation of more than $1.5 million, he was the third-highest paid public university president in 2023, according to rankings by the Chronicle of Higher Education.\nAssanis' tenure at UD was marked by tremendous growth at the STAR Campus, including the construction of the STAR Tower, the Ammon Pinizzotto Biopharmaceutical Innovation Center, the Chemours Discovery Hub, the FinTech Innovation Hub and, coming soon, the Securing American Biomanufacturing Research and Education Center and a Buccini Pollin Group apartment complex. UD's role as headquarters for the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals has brought in hundreds of millions in federal funding.\nWhen Assanis arrived in 2016, the STAR Campus was still in its infancy. Now, the site is home to 1.2 million square feet of new buildings and employs 3,000 people, more than it did when Chrysler was there.\nOn the main campus, UD opened the South Academy Residence Hall and, most recently, the new interdisciplinary science lab known as Building X. Earlier this year, the university announced its largest-ever donation, a $71.5 million commitment from alumni Rob and Kathy Siegfried to construct a new building for the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics.\nAssanis also launched the First State Promise, a program that aims to cover all tuition and fees for Delawarean undergraduate students coming from families with incomes under $75,000. Approximately one-third of enrolled Delawareans are covered by the program.\nOn the athletics side, one of Assanis' first hires was Rawak as athletic director and together they aimed to increase the prominence of Blue Hen sports programs, which Assanis often said are the \"front porch\" of the university. He presided over the renovation of Delaware Stadium, the construction of the Whitney Athletic Center and most recently the decision to move to Conference USA and the Football Bowl Subdivision.\nFinancial strife\nAssanis led the university through COVID-19, a crisis that required the university to quickly pivot to virtual learning and upended the university's finances. At the height of the pandemic, UD reported a $250 million deficit and instituted employee layoffs and furloughs.\nAs the pandemic waned, the university's financial difficulties continued. In 2024, Assanis reported that UD had a budget deficit of up to $40 million, which he blamed on inflation and skyrocketing health insurance costs.\nAssanis instituted a partial hiring freeze, delayed capital projects, restricted employee travel and implemented other austerity measures. The university is forecasting another large deficit this year.\nIt was Assanis' handling of that situation that prompted criticism from faculty members.\nLast spring, a survey of more than 750 university professors found that virtually all believed the university was not transparent about its finances and that it did not prioritize academics when it came to budgeting, according to reporting by the Newark Post's newsroom partner, Spotlight Delaware. About a dozen professors submitted anonymous comments that said they wanted faculty to call for a vote of no confidence in Assanis.\nIn a study released earlier this year, the faculty union questioned Assanis' \"poverty narrative\" and argued that the university's continued building spree was to blame for the financial difficulties.\n\"That's a lot of operating resources to be directed into building,\" Persephone Braham, the president of the university's faculty union, told Spotlight Delaware. \"That's tuition, that's fees, that's research [facilities and administrative] funding, that is a local contribution from the endowment draw down, and only an average of 9-10% is being funded by presidential fundraising.\"\nTown-gown relations\nAssanis leaves a complicated legacy in terms of the university's relationship with the city it calls home.\nUnder his tenure, UD has faced sustained criticism from many Newark leaders and residents for its decision to push more of the burden of housing students onto the private sector, putting pressure on the city to approve more and more off-campus student housing projects, often against the wishes of residents.\nIn 2019, UD abruptly closed the Christina Towers, thus taking 1,300 beds off the market. The university also took control of the once-private University Courtyard Apartments, which removed the sprawling complex from the city tax rolls.\nUD has also faced criticism for not contributing enough to the city's finances. That came to a head last year when city council \u2014 against the strong opposition of the UD administrators and students \u2014 began lobbying the state legislature for the power to levy a per-student tax on UD. A bill allowing the city to do so passed the state House and is awaiting consideration in the Senate.\nFormer mayor Jerry Clifton credited Assanis with cultivating a better relationship with the city than previous UD administrations did.\n\"Dennis made sure that I had all his contact information and could readily reach out to him,\" Clifton said in an interview Monday. \"I've enjoyed our relationship together with Dennis and Eleni, and I certainly will miss that.\"\nHe also praised Assanis for agreeing to sell the former Rodney dorm complex to the city at a steep discount, leading to the creation of Hillside Park and the stormwater pond.\n\"It was a huge win for the city,\" Clifton said. \"There's no way that would be a park today if it wasn't for the university and Dennis cooperating at the level that they did.\"\nThat said, UD's public battle against the student tax hurt how the public views the university, Clifton said.\n\"I think there could have been, and had been some, negotiations, but what they saw as their value to the community was not necessarily the cash that we saw that we needed because of the loss in tax revenue,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A dream come true: Italian exchange student spending a year in Maryland\n\n May 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARTY MADDEN mmadden@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 669\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Unlike Mantua, Italy, there is no opera house in Huntingtown. However, to Emma Agazzani, a resident of Italy's \"Capital of Culture,\" living in the U.S.A. in general and Calvert County in particular has hit a high note.According to her, it's been a dream come true.\n\"It was something I wanted to do since I was very young,\" the teen told Southern Maryland News, adding that \"the language, the culture, the travel\" had her determined to pursue the opportunity to experience the life of a foreign exchange student.\n\"I applied in February 2022 with A.S.S.E.,\" Agazzani, 17, said.\nThe American Scandinavian Student Exchange has expanded since it was established in 1976. The exchange has its origins in Europe in the late-1930s. After World War II the exchange gained momentum and today over 30 countries on six continents participate.\nOn its website, the exchange states its mission is an effort \"to foster international understanding through educational and cross cultural programs.\"\n\"My parents were hosts,\" Danielle Higginbotham of Huntingtown told Southern Maryland News in recalling how she and her family opened their home to Agazzani. \"I knew it was something we wanted to do. We were researching students and Emma's profile stuck out with us.\"\nAgazzani is a senior at Huntingtown High this year and will walk in the June graduation ceremony before returning to Italy later that month when her exchange program ends. She said since Italian high school is a five-year program she still has another year of secondary schooling to go in her home country before she will be off to a university.\nAt Huntingtown, Agazzani has been able to experience something that wouldn't be possible in Europe.\nOf cheerleading, Agazzani said, \"It was another of my dreams. When I think about the U.S. and high school, I think about cheerleading, because cheerleading is not a thing in Italy or Europe in general. It was my only option.\"\nIn addition to cheerleading, Agazzani has played lacrosse, a sport that hasn't caught on at all in Europe.\n\"I just finished lacrosse season and I really like it,\" she said, crediting her coaches for teaching her how to play the sport and excel in it.\nLife for Emma Agazzani of Mantua at Huntingtown High hasn't been all cheers and sports, though. As a student, she is taking classes in Advanced Placement English \u2014 she has been taught English since first grade \u2014 A.P. Government, pre-calculus, biology, photography and theater.\nAs for what she will study in college, Agazzani said, \"It's going to be something about science. I would like to be a neurologist.\"\nWhen not in school, the Higginbothams have given Agazzani a chance to see America. She has traveled to several locations in Florida, including Disney World, where she donned a cheerleader's outfit for the annual Christmas parade.\nWhile in Florida, Agazzani also got a chance to swim with dolphins.\n\"We tried to do a whole bunch of 'must-sees,'\" Higginbotham said.\nThe hosts and exchange student have also traveled to New York City, Atlanta and Philadelphia.\nAgazzani recalled one obligatory culinary experience in Philadelphia.\n\"I had the cheesesteak,\" she said. \"That was amazing.\"\nShe also has been to Washington, D.C., and visited the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll, meeting President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump.\nComparing the urbanized character of her hometown, with its art galleries and opera houses, to the bucolic, wide open expanse of Huntingtown, Agazzani said, \"it's very different. In Italy everything is tiny and compressed. Here, everything is spread out and very big.\"\nOf her hometown she said, \"We are walkable. We have a lot of history and arts.\"\nAgazzani summed up her Hurricane high school experience, saying, \"I really like the school and this town. I'm a senior here. I think it's more interesting.\"\nHigginbotham conceded that the experience of having a teenage cheerleader in her home has been so incredible that, while she will offer aid and advice to other families who want to participate in hosting an exchange student, for now she feels fulfillment from her experiences with Agazzani.\n\"She's my daughter now,\" Higginbotham said. \"We've created a friendship, a bond.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They also describe their own role within the organization along with the day-to-day functions,\" Carter said.\nIt is advantageous to students because employers know real-world demands and can outline the educational requirements to work in that field.\nParticipating businesses this year included Chesapeake CNC, DMS & Associates, Eastman Specialty Corp., Modern Stone Age Food Lab, Sunrise Solar, University of Maryland Shore Medical Center, Washington College GIP Program and the University of Maryland Extension, which partnered with Red Acres Hydroponics to demonstrate the wide range of advances in agricultural technologies.\nCarter said the Kent County STEM students, their parents and teachers greatly appreciate the businesses and professionals who share their time and resources to make the program a success.\n\"The program is a timely resource for students as they look into secondary education and any specialized studies they will need in order to qualify for the careers they desire,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot council mulling $1.1 million request from school district\n\n May 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 706\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 With less than two weeks until the Talbot County Council adopts its budget ordinance for next fiscal year, education funding hangs in the balance.Talbot County Public Schools is seeking $1.1 million in additional funds for fiscal year 2026 \u2014 $600,000 to fill nine new positions and $500,000 for teacher and staff salary increases. The former would add to the district's multilingual and special education staff, while the latter aims to inch the district closer to state-mandated $60,000 teacher salary minimums by fiscal year 2027.\nDistrict leaders say it's a \"scaled-back\" request from its $5.7 million ask of the county earlier this budget cycle.\n\"We recognize the financial pressures you face,\" Board of Education President Emily Jackson said at a May 6 budget hearing. \"This ask is lean, deliberate and rooted in what's most necessary to keep moving forward.\"\nIn the county's budget already is $55 million for TCPS as required by The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's overarching education improvement framework.\nCouncil members are left to mull the best option as they prepare to vote on final amendments to the county's draft $161 million budget. So far, there's no clear decision.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher supported fulfilling the district's full $5.7 million request last month and maintained that stance for the pared down ask at a budget deliberation Tuesday.\n\"We're going to have to do it sooner or later,\" Lesher said. \"I think it makes sense to do it this year and reduce the pain next year.\"\nPresident Chuck Callahan said he feels comfortable with honoring the $600,000 part of the request to cover the new positions.\nCouncil members Keasha Haythe, Lynn Mielke and Dave Stepp have all indicated they need more time to consider options.\nAny additional funding granted would result in an education supplement to the property tax rate, which is 79 cents per $100 of assessed value.\nTalbot County is already mandated by the state to pay $440,000 for teachers' pensions, which will be collected through a supplement of less than half a cent per $100 of assessed value.\nThree potential scenarios for tax supplements have been laid out by county staff:\nTeachers' pensions only: 0.0045 per $100 of assessed value.\nTeachers' pensions and $500,000 for salary increases: 0.0096 per $100 of assessed value.\nTeachers' pensions and $600,000 for new positions: 0.0106 per $100 of assessed value.\nHaythe said Tuesday she's trying to balance helping the school system with preventing tax increases for residents on fixed income, such as seniors.\n\"I am in no way, shape or form trying to discount the great work that the school system does and what the teachers do in the classroom,\" Haythe said.\nAt last week's hearing, teachers and parents advocated for the council to include the $1.1 million. Lisa Hayes, a parent of three TCPS graduates, said past education investments are paying off now as her children enter the workforce.\n\"You cannot not fund a budget for our children's education because there is nothing more important than that,\" Hayes said.\nAndy Burke, president of the Talbot County Education Association, which functions as the teachers' union, made his case.\n\"We continue to see too many educators migrate away to the higher wages and salaries paid in neighboring public school systems,\" Burke said.\nIn an emailed statement, TCPS Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said the district made \"very difficult choices\" to reduce its request to the county.\nJones noted staff will present the Board of Education with a budget amendment package in June, which will adjust the $86 million unrestricted budget the board OK'd in February.\n\"We will eliminate most of the new positions we had requested,\" Jones wrote. \"We will scale back our requests and defer programs that will have the least direct impact on our goals for our students.\"\nA final decision by the county on the $1.1 million in question, as well as the entire FY26 budget, is expected at the council's May 27 meeting.\nWhile no clear choice was made during Tuesday's deliberations, county and district leaders did agree that state mandates and formulas are creating the tricky fiscal situation.\n\"It's just become screamingly clear that there's a disconnect at the state level between the requirements that they're putting on local schools across the state, and the funding formulas that are articulated to county governments to pay for their education,\" said County Manager Clay Stamp. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The potential middle school would sit on a 23-acre parcel.\nOn that parcel, there is a solar field area that architects would have to contend with. There is also a pasture connected to the Career Center that could impact school placement and design.\nCommunity members brought forward suggestions for what the county could do with the Lockerman location if it moved next to North Caroline High. They recommended students could share bus routes with high schoolers and made safety suggestions for both schools.\nThe Double Hills road site is located near the Caroline County Sheriffs Office and Caroline County Emergency Services buildings on 76 acres. The county owns the land, and the Lockerman Committee is looking for a 21-acre portion.\nKevin Shearon, engineer for the Lockerman project, brought attention to the size and distance of the road and made considerations for what they would do to the road to make it accessible for the school.\n\"Double Hills is a 20-21 foot road with no shoulders on either side,\" Shearon said. \"So, we would consider adding shoulders, at least on the school side or the site side for ACLD cell and just a wider feel for the right.\"\nAccording to Lockerman Committee members, the public water and sewer could be extended from the Denton's systems for the potential school.\nAfter explaining both new locations, Lockerman Committee members and Superintendent Derek Simmons answered questions from residents and heard their concerns and suggestions.\n\"It was great to see the turnout,\" Simmons said. \"It was great to see the engagement, folks are really passionate about their faults, which is great. Our architects and our consultants need that information now as we're working in the very early stages of design. I'm glad they came out.\n\"There will be another opportunity on June 2, and I hope the turnout is equally as good as not better. Because the board's got a big decision to make in July, and we want to provide them with the best information we can on the sites that we're considering.\"\nThe next public meeting on potential school locations will be held on June 2 at Lockerman Middle School at 6 p.m. Following that, the committee will have a presentation to the Board of Education on July 1 about their decision. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "100 years and counting: Talbot County Free Library endures as community linchpin\n\n May 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 664\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Over the last 100 years, the Talbot County Free Library has adapted to societal changes such as the creation of the Internet, economic downturns like the Great Depression and, most recently, a global pandemic.As the world changes around it, the organization's staff and volunteers are ensuring sure the library keeps up. Executive Director Dana Newman believes the library is well-positioned to serve the community's needs for years to come.\n\"I do think the library will continue to move with the future, and it will continue to be here,\" Newman said.\nServing residents across the entire county, the Talbot County Free Library has oriented itself as a hub for the county. Between a physical collection of over 130,000 books and other items, computer and technology access, and hundreds of free programs, Newman says the library has more resources available than most people would think.\nThis October, the library will host a centennial gala, an opportunity for many to celebrate the library's history and its impact on residents in the 100 years since its inception.\nEmma Poole, TCFL's communications manager, was born in Easton and still has her original library card from when she was 3.\n\"This has always been such a safe space for me,\" Poole said. \"My parents brought me here all the time. I begged my mom to bring me to the library. I'd drag her out of the house.\"\nDuring college, Poole used the library's expansive Maryland Room collection in writing her historical thesis. And now as a staff member, Poole recognizes the institution's purpose in Talbot County extends far past books and research.\n\"It's so much more than books,\" she said.\nADAPTING OVER TIME\nOn Oct. 15, 1925, Talbot County Free Library opened in two rooms in the Tred Avon Building on South Washington Street. Caroline Burnite Walker founded the library, which began with an 800-book collection.\nShe was a longtime children's librarian, and the early days of Talbot's library focused on serving the youth. Scotti Oliver, current assistant director, says the organization's \"emphasis has always been on children's services.\"\nThe library offers many early literacy programs, partners with local schools and will host the 10th annual Chesapeake Children's Book Festival this June.\nTCFL moved inside the courthouse in the 1940s and soon became one of Maryland's first county-wide public library systems. Around three decades later, it moved to West Dover Street, where it sits today.\nEver since its founding, the nonprofit has constantly adapted, library leaders say.\n\"I think we demonstrated over time that when people think, 'Well maybe the library's a thing of the past,' it's not,\" Newman said. \"Because there's a new need, and there's a need for instruction. We are a learning institution.\"\nAmong the many offerings are book clubs, community meeting rooms, a free collection of seeds, tax assistance aid and social services programs.\nFollowing the pandemic, Newman says the organization reinvented itself in a way, focusing much more on digital literacy classes, availability of computers and devices, and internet access.\nNewman noted the library has demonstrated an ability to pivot when needed, a skill that'll help tackle future challenges \u2014 one being the rise of AI.\nCOMMUNITY LINCHPIN\nWhile the library's main branch is in well-populated Easton, TCFL is undergoing renovations to its branch site in St. Michaels. The building will expand and add children's spaces.\nOne of Newman's hopes is that the Bookmobile service can return. Ending in the 1990s due to a lack of funding, the Bookmobile made trips to remote parts of the county such as Tilghman Island, Cordova and Trappe. Newman said the library understands the importance of reaching these communities, and is looking to secure funding for the venture in the near future.\nAround 20,000 county residents hold a library card, over 7,000 of them children. Like Poole, many of those cardholders consider the library a safe place.

For Caroline County Public Schools, honoring the event meant taking time to celebrate teachers and support staff.The weeklong celebration featured free coffee and visits from Caroline County district employees for every school.\n\"I feel that it is very important to recognize the teachers and support staff that works every day to make learning at our school a worthwhile and important venture for our students,\" Caroline County Board of Education President Michele Wayman said. \"We wouldn't be able to have our school opened without our support staff and our teachers.\"\nFor district teachers, the biggest takeaway from the week was the chance to reflect on why they do what they do.\n\"It's a chance to recognize the dedication, passion and hard work educators pour into their students every day. Highlighting teachers is important because they do far more than teach; they inspire, support, and help shape the future,\" Caroline County Public Schools Educators Association President Amy Bauman said.\n\"In a time when educators face growing challenges, this week reminds our community to value and uplift them.\"\nCaroline County Public Schools 2024-25 Teacher of the Year Danielle Dennis is a math teacher at Colonel Richardson High School. In addition to teaching, she is an indoor track and field coach, Class of 2025 advisor and spirit club advisor.\nDennis said she became a teacher to make a difference in students' lives in the very community she grew up in.\n\"I attended Caroline County Public Schools and graduated from Colonel Richardson High School in 2011, so I hoped to have the same influence that so many amazing educators did in my life,\" Dennis said.\nIn addition to being the President of Caroline County Public Schools Educators Association, Bauman has been a teacher for 23 years, all at Denton Elementary School.\nBauman biggest joy as a teacher is turning a new group of students into family.\n\"Seeing our bond grow as we learn together, share laughs, and lift each other up is what brings me so much joy. It's not just about lessons. It's playing kickball, making slime, publishing our very own book and showing up at their sporting events.\"\nAccording to Wayman, the teachers and support staff are \"very appreciative\" of the Teacher of the Year celebration.\n\"They're very appreciative of everything that is done to celebrate and recognize the hard work that they do,\" Wayman said. \"... I don't take any of the visions for granted. Everyone has a part they do in making the school day a beautiful day for students.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

While a handful of the speakers indicated support for the sticker removal, many expressed opposition.\nSheri Tardio of Prince Frederick called the issue \"manufactured outrage. Safe space stickers do not promote ideology. Diversity is a fact.\"\n\"You are not hiding your biases very well,\" said Stacy Tayman, president of the Calvert Association for Educational Support Staff.\n\"Removing stickers is not a violation of First Amendment rights,\" said school board President Jana Post in her closing comments, adding that the April discussion \"was twisted\" into an LGBTQ issue.\n\"Real safety comes from a culture of trust,\" Post said.\nAt the conclusion of public comments, board member Paul Harrison made a motion to discuss \"a flag policy\" at a future meeting. That policy would likely be aimed at setting parameters for displays of flags, posters and decals in school buildings. The motion passed unanimously.\nSupervisor's post\nThe school board unanimously approved the appointment of Marc Watson as supervisor of health, physical education and athletics. The Indiana University of Pennsylvania graduate is a familiar face in Calvert County where he has previously served as a teacher, coach and principal.\nMost recently, Watson served as principal of King George High School in Virginia.\nWatson told the board he was looking forward to \"continuing to create this wonderful environment of learning and athletics\" in Calvert County.\nIn recommending Watson for the appointment, Townsel said the returning administrator will provide \"training and mentorship for coaches.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Henry Price II, American Legion Post 246, earlier this month when President of the Auxiliary Patti Bone announced it, Sanchez was so excited she put her hands to her mouth, glancing around the room in amazement. Her family kept it a secret on purpose to make the moment extra special.\nOvercoming stage fright, without a hint of waver in her voice, Sanchez read her essay to 30 people in the room.\nThis was the first speech of the afternoon for the Legion Auxiliary's annual Americanism Essay Contest, created to teach students the value of patriotism.\nThousands of students from grades three to 12 around the nation participate, each year having a different theme.\nThis year's topic: \"What does 'America the Beautiful' mean to me (regarding veterans and our military).\nIn her essay, Sanchez thanked our military who fight for our country to protect us from enemies.\n\"Many people have lost their life for us so we can have a better one,\" she recited.\nShe added these soldiers are role models and expressed her love for America to a hearty applause.\nLike all six speakers that night, she received a cash prize, (first place $50, second $20, third $10) a certificate, congratulations from Betterton Mayor Donald Sutton and a goody bag of patriotic items like comic books, rulers, flags and candy to sweeten the deal.\nWinners receive $50 and a $50 donation in the student's name is made to the Children of Warriors National Presidents' Scholarship fund.\nComing in second among third graders, was Chloe Cummings, who talked about the American flag being the symbol of freedom, pride and unity. In third place, Annistyn Clayton explained America brings unity to the world; America is a special place with beautiful landscapes she wants to visit and is home to great friends.\nComing in first for fifth graders was Liam Miller, detailing what makes our military so special, from the oldest branch, the Army, to the newest, the Space Force. He urged the audience to remember why America is a blessed nation.\n\"America is beautiful because of the things the soldiers did that would not be forgotten. We as Americans celebrate and remember our soldiers. God bless America,\" he read.\nAmelia Rigby, in second, focused in on the lyrics of \"America the Beautiful\" calling veterans heroes. She was proud of one hero particularly, her mother, an Air Force veteran. Third place Samantha Carroll also talked about the lyrics of \"America the Beautiful\" providing an in-depth look at some poignant lines which inspire unity in the world.\nBone said the Betterton auxiliary has been having the essay contest for over 15 years and thanked all members of the Legion and the families for their attendance. She said they are always glad to see the community show up and support the students and socialize with refreshments and cookies.\nWith free family-focused entertainment in mind, she announced they will hold a Community Day on Flag Day, June 14. Bone encouraged the public to check them out and grab a free hotdog. There will be a bouncy house, petting zoo and some other activities planned for that day.\n\"We love doing these things for our families,\" Bone said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Addressing that deficit meant Dorchester County schools lost after-school and summer programming.\nThe cuts to education come at a time when the county ranks 21st out of 24 school districts (including Baltimore City) in third grade literacy and 22nd out of 24 in overall English Language Arts proficiency in the state.\nThe Y is partnering with the John and Janice Wyatt Foundation to create a space for the Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading, a campaign that aims to target childhood illiteracy.\n{span}The campaign was inspired by the movie \"Sentenced,\" which was produced and narrated by NBA champion Stephen Curry. The film explores the epidemic of childhood illiteracy and its lifelong impacts.{/span}\n\"Dorchester County has, for a long time, been ranked very low in the state of Maryland,\" said Matthew Peterson, executive director of the John and Janice Wyatt Foundation. \"And so interestingly, now concurrent to all the work that the Y is doing, that we're all doing together, Dorchester County Public Schools is undergoing a strategic plan to go from 21st, to 15.\"\nThe Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading plans to approach this goal from multiple angles and with multiple partnerships.\nBecause third grade is a pivotal marker for childhood learning development, the campaign's target population are children from birth to age 5, so they are better prepared to enter kindergarten, and are less likely to fall behind.\n\"So we're trying to grab moms as prenatal because we're gonna do infant groups, we're gonna do, you know, toddler groups, mommy and me groups, so we want to bring awareness at early childhood,\" said Tynice DeShields, director of mental health at the YMCA of Chesapeake.\nThe campaign's partners include county schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson, the Dorchester County Public Library, United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, Operation Pathways and volunteers from the community.\n\"There's a number of agencies we've been working with over the years. You know, as any organization, some were more engaged than others, and so bringing everybody on board, finding out where that alignment fits best, and then trying to leverage that, to do the best we can, is what we've always tried to have,\" Peterson said.\nThe reading hub will be a space that is open to the public and YMCA members alike.\n\"We're building this reading hub as a meeting place where we can have a resource center, we can have meetings with the community, we can have sessions with the parents to teach their kids how to read, how to look at letters and numbers, and not just throw a book in front of them,\" said Bryant Wittington, director of the Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading.\nPeterson, DeShields and Wittington are excited to engage with the community and hope to build a strong foundation of volunteers at the reading hub.\n\"We want to build that unity in the community,\" Wittington said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "It's time to pause state's education blueprint\n\n May 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 762\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n One of the issues in Maryland's state government and political arena that has generated recurring and intense debate, is funding for a 10-year educational improvement initiative known as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, also referred to as the Blueprint or as Kirwan.The goals for Kirwan include expanding participation in pre-kindergarten programs, more funding for schools with high concentrations of poverty, increasing pay and opportunities for teachers, and creating career pathways for high school students.\nWith regard to pre-kindergarten, the Kirwan plan has two specific and measurable goals.\nFirst, in 10 years, 80% of all 4-year-olds and all 3-year-olds are to be enrolled in pre-kindergarten programs, up from 40% in the 2023 school year.\nSecond, achieve the first goal by using a \"mixed delivery system\" using public school pre-kindergarten programs and private pre-kindergarten providers.\nTo date, achieving those goals has been elusive and may not occur on the current schedule.\nA headline in one recent Maryland media outlet article was, \"Even as spending rises, under half of Maryland 4-year-olds attend public pre-K.\"\nThe article references reports from the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University. They note that Maryland lags behind 17 other states enrolling kids in public pre-kindergarten programs, despite spending thousands more per child than it used to.\nLast school year, 38% percent of 4-year-olds in Maryland were enrolled in state-funded pre-K programs, down one spot in the national rankings from the previous year.\nLast year, 7% of 3-year-olds in Maryland were enrolled, also one spot below the previous year.\nRutgers reports those results occurred despite Maryland spending $358 million in state funds and an additional $3.8 million in federal pandemic recovery funds.\nHow much Maryland spent per pre-kindergartner, including federal recovery funds, is up $3,979 from the previous year.\nWith regard to the goal expecting greater involvement from private prekindergarten providers in an expanded pre-K program, current participation to date, is lower than expected.\nIn a survey of the state's private childcare providers, only 12.9% of respondents said they plan to or were already involved in the pre-K program created under the Blueprint.\nMore than a third of the 256 respondents said they were unsure whether they will participate in the pre-K expansion and nearly 40% said they would not. 12.9% of the survey responders had never even heard of it, the same as the percentage of those who are already involved in it.\nAll this news is in addition to sobering reports from the General Assembly's nonpartisan legislative budget analysts.\nThey are projecting that by next year, the state's structural budget deficit will grow to $1 billion. In fiscal 2027, the last year of Governor Moore's first term, it grows to $1.3 billion. A year later, it more than doubles to $3 billion.\nThat certainly helps explain Moody's downgrading the state's fiscal outlook from stable to \"negative,\" citing looming structural deficits driven by state funding needed for Kirwan.\nIn its report, Moody's wrote, \"The negative outlook incorporates difficulties Maryland will face to achieve balanced financial operations in coming years without sacrificing service delivery goals or adding to the weight of the state government's burden on individual and corporate taxpayers.\"\nThis news means the leadership of the General Assembly and Gov. Moore need to engage further in bi partisan dialogue and deliberations on tough decisions regarding revisions to Kirwan.\nThat is not unprecedented.\nGov. Moore and the General Assembly leadership did that prior to the end of the 2025 General Assembly session. There was bipartisan agreement on and support to delay a Kirwan mandate for local school districts to increase teacher collaborative time for curriculum planning, grading and professional development outside of the classroom.\nAbout that outcome Moore said, \"Two years before I was sworn in as governor, the General Assembly passed a historic piece of education reform. But, like any big law of ambition and bold aspiration, we knew that there would have to be responsible adjustments and enhancements that had to be made.\"\nThe revisions made on teacher collaborative time were a good step but is not nearly enough.\nThe governor must call for a special legislative session as soon as possible this year and well before the next regular 90-day session that convenes in January 2026.\nHe must also ensure the sole focus for that special session is next steps for Kirwan.\nThe best outcome of that special session should be twofold.\nBipartisan approval to a pause on all state funding for Kirwan until a date certain in the future.\nBipartisan approval of a pause on all new mandates for local school boards, until a date certain in the future. They know best about student needs and limits on funds to meet those needs.\nMaryland citizens and Maryland taxpayers deserve nothing less. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He encouraged graduates to never fear, embrace hard work and maintain connections.\n\"Everyone has to start somewhere, and sometimes the correct way is not the easiest,\" Coppersmith said. With its legacy of watermen and farmers, the Eastern Shore is known even today for its strong work ethic, he said.\nKeynote speaker, former U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, was presented the college's Community Service Award in recognition of his service as a senior statesman, his Chesapeake Bay protection efforts, his dedication to human and civil rights, and his staunch advocacy for higher education.\n\"Graduation marks a profound turning point in your life. It is not only the culmination of hard work and dedication, but also the beginning of a new chapter filled with opportunity. What you do with that opportunity is up to you,\" Cardin said.\n\"Embrace hope,\" Cardin said, noting the student body was stronger due to its diversity. \"Never give up hope for a stronger, more inclusive, more equitable society,\" he said.\nCardin urged graduates to recognize history lessons as more than words in textbooks, but as guides on what not to do and on how ordinary individuals can be extraordinary.\n\"As graduates, you have the tools to think globally and act locally. You are the architects of a world where hope becomes reality,\" he said.\nFor her breakthroughs in pushing learning past the pages of textbooks, including unforgettable methods of blending academic rigor with applied learning and creative applications, the inaugural Adjunct Innovative Teaching Award was presented to Cherie Patchett, instructor of psychology.\nOpening eyes to the world of psychology, Patchett's impact was also noted to extend beyond the classroom, supporting students by establishing a mental health club on campus.\nPatchett encouraged graduates to embrace their individuality to innovate their lives.\nThe John T. Harrison Award was presented to 2025 graduate Cianni A. Phillips for her dedication and empathy. She exemplified true leadership qualities by developing student-focused campus communities.\nPhillips is a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society and is on the Dean's List with a 3.8 GPA.\nPhillips served on the Student Government Association, was president of the UHURU Black Student Union, and, in addition to numerous student clubs, served as a student worker in the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. She will transfer to Coppin State University in Baltimore to pursue a bachelor's degree in social work.\nLooking upon the graduating class, Phillips noted the students balanced all manner of life, including jobs and families, along with their schoolwork, to successfully earn a place at the commencement, which was more than a ceremony \u2014 it was a celebration and victory, she said.\nMoving forward, Phillips encouraged her classmates to continually build support networks, pour back into the community, and be the representation so strongly needed.\n\"Young people need to see what their futures can be,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025",

During the the county school board's May 22 work session, Cecelia Lewis, director of student services, presented summaries of the code of conduct and the significant changes that are proposed, including the use of AI.Lewis called the proposed references and policies related to artificial intelligence \"a huge highlight this year. Technology continues to evolve.\"\nThe \"added guidelines for use of artificial intelligence\" cover \"educational use, academic integrity, ethical use, supervision and monitoring and prohibited conduct.\"\nThe code's definition of \"academic dishonesty/cheating\" is proposed to now include \"unauthorized use of digital or AI-generated materials, sharing of local, state or federal test information.\"\nThe drafters of the code of conduct's rewrite added \"utilizing AI-generated content to harass, intimidate or bully any member of the school community\" to the bullying, harassment and intimidation definition in the document's \"levels of responses\" section.\nIn a new section of the code entitled \"responsible use of technology,\" there is a mandate listed on \"avoiding plagiarism and AI misuse.\"\nIn addressing a question asked by Grace Minakowski, the outgoing student member of the board, on allowing for the citing of artificial intelligence and deciding what work might be plagiarism, Lewis said, \"the teacher's determination\" would be the big factor. She added that an artificial intelligence course for teachers \"is being developed.\"\nBoard member Melissa Goshorn asked if artificial intelligence training for students is also being considered.\n\"That is on our radar,\" Lewis said. \"It's something we are developing.\"\nLewis said the school system's instructional department's technology supervisors will be involved in developing the training for teachers and students.\nJackie Jacobs, chief academic officer, indicated classroom teachers will be giving students direction in the use of artificial intelligence and the extent of its use will be \"dependent on what teachers are looking for.\"\nIn providing an overview on the code of conduct, Lewis told the board that many stakeholders contributed to the revisions, with a focus on assuring Calvert's public schools have a \"safe, welcoming environment.\"\nMuch of the code is guided by state law, Lewis indicated during her presentation.\nOther proposed changes include the addition of Safe Schools Maryland contact information. The free system is available to students, teachers, school staff members, parents and the general public \"to report any school or student safety concerns, including mental health concerns.\"\nJana Post, school board president, called the work Lewis and the stakeholders did on revising the code \"a humongous overhaul\" and commended the group for its work.\nThe revised code will now be posted on the school system's website until late June for public review and comments.\nHigh school theatre group lauded\nA school organization used to receiving cheers and applause was showered with more accolades May 22 as the Patuxent High School Harlequins received a recognition from the school board.\nThe citation noted the group earned a superior rating at the 2025 Maryland Thespians Festival with their production of the one-act play \"Everybody,\" by Brandon Jacobs-Jenkins. The Patuxent troupe earned the most superior scores at the recent festival.\n\"It's our tradition of unparalleled student leadership,\" Allen Price, Harlequins' production director, said after the citation was read and unanimously approved by the board. He added the program's long history of achievement was due to \"student ownership\" and \"dedication to our program. The students care about the other students' successes.\"\nEarlier this week, Price told Southern Maryland News that the Maryland State Department of Education is showcasing the Harlequins in a short documentary that focuses on the group's outstanding use of student leadership and student ownership to produce high quality shows.\nTwitter: @MartySoMdNews \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Association Secretary David Kemp pointed out the rockets that day, large or small, use the same propellant as boosters on space shuttles.\nThanks to the organization's efforts, you do not need to be NASA trained to be a rocketeer.\nFor example, youth LaShawn Sudler watched his smaller rocket launch beside his step-grandfather, Mark Kraemer. It went 500-600 feet in the air, then released its chute at 200 feet.\nA kid of few words, nonetheless Sudler showed pride in his rockets. Kraemer is passing his love of rocketry down to him and has fond memories of buying rocket kits when he was Sudler's age.\n\"These are just big boy toys,\" he said. \"We love this stuff.\"\nOver in another tent, friends Rich Custer and Erin Dawson from Northern Virginia showcased their rocket made from a fencepost and ceiling fan blades.\nUnder another tent, married couple Glenn and Adrienne Ramey shared how they even turned Christmas trees into rockets that when launched, spin the whole time.\nOn the grounds, there was just a handful of rocketeers in attendance, a smaller crowd since the American Rocketry Challenge was taking place in Virginia, said Fred Wallace, president of the association. Even though the conditions were a little windy, he had his high powered rocket with him just in case things calmed.\nAlthough they were low in number that day, it offered a perfect opportunity to learn about the hobby.\nThat day, most landings were smooth although one rocket had a rough landing, the chute not deploying.\nThe association encourages all to come out to get their chance to be a rocketeer. People 18 and under fly for free. If you do not have a rocket, they have plenty to start you on your journey.\n\"Moms and dads, bring your kids,\" Wallace urged. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Aviat alumnae gather for first reunion in 40 years\n\n May 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jane Bellmyer jbellmyer@cecilwlhig.com | Section: News \n \n 620\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It's been 40 years since these ladies gathered around to reminisce about their halcyon days at Mount Aviat Academy.They met at Schaefer's Canal House in Chesapeake City last month. Their last reunion was 40 years ago at The Swiss Inn in Elkton. (Now Mick's Crab House)\nFrom 1960 until 1972 the school in the Childs area of Elkton was the only Catholic High School in Cecil County and it was a girls-only school for boarding and day students.\n\"I was in the first graduating class,\" said Barbara Ashton Johnson. \"My last name started with an 'A' so I had to be first.\"\nHaving to be the first in line made the Philadelphia native nervous.\n\"I had to be the first to kneel before the bishop and kiss his ring,\" Johnson said of the long-ago experience.\nMount Aviat began with a group of Swiss nuns, in a program organized by local parents. The nuns came to the convent and organized the high school, which was led by Sister Francis Marguerite.\n\"She was idolized,\" said Eileen Stubbs Viars.\nSister Francis Marguerite was the stuff of legend, according to Alva Eldridge Dopp, who was a boarding student from Fredericktown, Md.\n\"When she was 19 she lived in Germany. She joined the Oblates and learned to be a nun in Italy,\" Dopp said of the revered nun. This was during the height of World War II. \"The Germans invaded their convent and lined them all up and shot them. The bullets grazed her head and her knee. She fell and played dead.\"\nElizabeth \"Betsy\" Patterson Patterson referred to Sister Francis Marguerite as \"the heart of the school.\"\nJudy Schamme Hart meanwhile, remembered Father Naulty fondly.\n\"We give credit for our musical training to Father Naulty. He was our Glee Club director,\" Hart said, adding that now, 47 years later she continues to use those singing skills in the choir at Immaculate Conception Church in Elkton.\nThere was a lot of fun to be had, Alva Eldridge Dopp recalled, telling the story of a fellow classmate with a gift for elopement.\n\"Jewel DiDomenica planned an escape with sheets out the window,\" Dopp said. \"Since I was the littlest they made me go down first. They figured they could hold the sheet.\"\nSister Mary Beth was waiting at the bottom.\n\"She said I was a girl once,\" Viars said. Although guilty as charged the sister meted out their payment less harshly.\nFor their punishment the young ladies had to clean all the floors at the school. In those days the uniform included clunky black shoes with heavy rubber soles that left a trail all over the floors.\n\"We were given little scraps of steel wool and we had to remove all the scuff marks off of the floor,\" Dopp said.\nThose uniforms included long dark skirts below the knee, which flew in the face of the 1960s fashion trend of mini skirts. Judy Schamme Hart said she was not alone in fixing that when getting on the bus to go home each afternoon.\n\"As soon as we got off of school property the top of the skirt got rolled up,\" she said. In spite of the uniform and the rules, she said: \"It was the best time of our lives.\"\nBy 1972, Mount Aviat was transitioning to a day school for children from kindergarten through 8th grade. Only nine classes graduated from Mount Aviat Academy's girls high school.\nWhether the students lived on campus or went home each evening, all agreed they formed a camaraderie that lasts to this day.\n\"We came together for Catholic education,\" Patterson said. \"But it wasn't just a Catholic education. It was an education in appreciating each other.\"\n\"But the camaraderie we had; relationships with girls not from your home town,\" Hart said. \"We built this community. We had a lot of fun.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said during her address to the class that the school's yearbook showed just how close students and faculty were during the last four years.\n\"What stood out the most were the connections I saw,\" Pepukayi said. \"As I turned each page, I saw smiles, I saw groups of students clustered together. \u2026 I saw laughing, talking, joking taking place between the students, among students, in between staff and students.\"\nPepukayi emphasized to the graduates that creating those human connections is vital, especially in a world influenced by artificial intelligence.\n\"I read that Generation Z, who are the ages of 18 to 28, require a higher level of human connection, whether it's at home, at school, or in places of business,\" Pepukayi said. \"Human connection. Now in the AI-driven world, this is of utmost importance. And that human connection is very evident in this class.\"\nEaston High valedictorian Mia Mazzeo shared a similar theme in her speech.\n\"When all the information in the world is just a click away, take that extra step and dig deeper,\" Mazzeo said. \"An eagerness to learn and an attentive teacher is all one really needs. It is only when you question how the world works that you can truly change it.\"\nMazzeo told her classmates that wisdom comes from interactions with one another.\n\"When I look back at my time in high school, I think I grew the most during late-night conversations with friends and after school chats with teachers,\" she said. \"The experiences you share with others and the advice they have to offer is priceless.\"\nST. MICHAELS HIGH\nOn Thursday, 60 seniors at St. Michaels High School threw their caps in the air and joyously celebrated the achievement of being a newly-minted graduate.\nValedictorian Alexandria Rockwell said the Class of 2025 showed \"incredible purpose\" and encouraged her classmates to maintain that same drive as they go their separate ways.\nRockwell said the last four years tested and pushed the graduating class.\n\"As we entered high school, many challenges were thrown at us,\" she said. \"Four years felt like forever. But now we're here. It's gone by in a flash, and it's bittersweet because we looked forward to this moment for so long, but now we know we're leaving behind something we'll never quite return to.\"\nSchool principal Theresa Vener echoed that Thursday's graduation was bittersweet, bidding farewell to the graduating class she's been alongside since starting as St. Michaels Middle High School principal seven years ago.\nVener, retiring this year after 32 years working for the district, was presented with an honorary diploma at Thursday's ceremonies. Students, staff and district administrators thanked her for her dedication and leadership.\nThe outgoing principal said it was an \"absolute privilege\" to watch the Class of 2025 grow into caring and confident young adults.\n\"I have watched you fall, get back up and take those steps forward,\" Vener said. \"One step at a time, but 'always forward,' just like your class motto says.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A day for children at the library\n\n May 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 821\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When I was 3 years old, my parents told me there would soon be a new addition to our family, that my mother was going to have a baby.At that age, my two favorite things in the world were TV cowboys and Coca-Cola, which inspired me to come up with the perfect name for my new brother or sister. I began to declare confidently (and often) that we should name the child \"Coco Bang-bang.\"\nWhen my parents finally admitted they were thinking along different lines, maybe \"Catherine\" or \"Robert,\" I began to have serious doubts about the whole enterprise.\nFor my entire life (which, at 3, stretched back toward infinity), I had been the center of Mom and Dad's world; the idea that I might now have to share their affections with some poorly named interloper rubbed me the the wrong way.\nI think my parents must have suspected my misgivings because about a month before the blessed event was to occur, they gave me a new picture book. I no longer remember the title of that tiny tome, but I do remember what it was about: a little boy, who looked a lot like me, was excited about the new baby his parents were about to bring home.\nActually, what I remember best about the book is a single illustration.\nAs I recall, it shows a scene that takes place immediately after the new addition to the family has arrived home from the hospital. The little boy sits on a couch. His parents have placed a pillow on his lap, and upon the pillow they have laid the child, its tiny hands lifted wonderingly toward the little boy's smiling face.\nImmediately, the idea that I too might sit on our couch, a pillow on my lap, an infant lying upon it, took possession of my impressionable 3-year-old mind. And, as I recall, my parents wisely allowed me to realize that fantasy when my little sister Cathy finally did come home from the hospital.\nI could be wrong, but it's my guess that picture book \u2014 whatever its title \u2014 probably saved my sister from a fair amount of brotherly pestering.\nWhich leads me, naturally enough, to the benefits accruing to children from books. On Saturday, June 7, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., come rain or shine, the Easton branch of the Talbot County Free Library will host the 10th annual Chesapeake Children's Book Festival.\nThis year's festival will feature 22 children's book authors and illustrators, all of whom underwent a rigorous vetting process before being selected to participate.\nChildren who sign up at the festival for the library's Summer Reading Program will receive a free cookie (while supplies last) imprinted with the festival's crab logo, courtesy of All in the Mix Bakeshop, and a voucher good for one free book (once again, while supplies last) from the attending author of their choice. It's always fun to see the pride children take in asking the author they've selected to sign the book they've received.\nThis year's festival will offer children some great books to choose from. Here's a small sampling of the many works that will be on display:\nDanielle Joseph's young adult novel \"Shrinking Violet\" was adapted into the Disney Channel movie \"Radio Rebel.\"\nColleen Kosinski's \"A Home Again\" is so popular, it's been translated into seven languages.\nTrinka Hakes Noble's \"The Day Jimmy's Boa Ate the Wash,\" (ALA Notable, PBS Reading Rainbow feature, American Book Award) has just celebrated its 45th year in print.\nJennifer O'Connell's beautifully illustrated picture books include \"The Eye of the Whale,\" winner of the Green Earth Book Award, and The New York Times bestseller \"Ten Timid Ghosts,\" which has sold more than a million copies.\nAnd Timothy Young (who first conceived of the Chesapeake Children's Book Festival) has set his middle-grade chapter book \"Mac and the Millstone of Time\" at the Old Wye Mill in Wye Mills.\nTraditionally, the festival resembles a small, library-sized carnival, designed to create a special day of fun for little ones. The Maryland State Opera Bears will be back for a return engagement this year, the Daughters of the American Revolution will offer crafts, the Judy Center will have their Make-A-Book table, the Master Gardeners will assure that Mother Nature provides an important part of the day's excitement, and Raising a Reader will set up a story walk.\nMaryland Public Television, The Imagination Library, Radcliffe Creek School and Friends of the Library will also be on hand to keep the day entertaining.\nThe Friends of the Library are the primary sponsors of both the Festival and the Summer Reading Program. Other festival sponsors this year include Maryland Public Television, Easton Utilities, Talbot County Government, Talbot Arts and the Maryland State Arts Council.\nAll in all, the Talbot County Free Library's 10th annual Chesapeake Children's Book Festival should be a special day for children. And those parents out there thinking about bringing a new baby into the world can rejoice. The name \"Coco Bang-bang\" remains available for their consideration. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'Green School' programs in Caroline County bring joy to students\n\n May 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chesoub.com | Section: News \n \n 611\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 As of this year, Two Caroline County public schools have been certified as Green Schools by the Maryland Association for Environmental and Outdoor Education.Denton Elementary joined Greensboro Elementary in gaining the certification this year. Both schools went through a two-year application process through MAEOE to be come Green School certified.\nAlthough directors for programs at the schools said the program was intense, they said the help they received from the community was surprising and made the process go much smoother.\n\"You have to work together, and we divided and conquered,\" said Julie Strange, pre-k teacher at and program coordinator for Green Schools at Denton Elementary. \"You have to contact people at the board office. You have to contact contact your cafeteria. You have to contact people I didn't even know did jobs.\n\"It's an intense process, but again, eye-opening how helpful everybody was and that there are people for everything.\"\nWithin that application for the program there are different subcategories for which the schools must show evidence they met the objective.\nThe application also comes with a curriculum that must be completed by the students, and the school must provide one example of outdoor or environmental instruction per grade level.\n\"Through our curriculum and standards, we're able to teach these kids sustainability practices and how to take care of the Earth, just learning about the Earth through those environmental literacy standards. It's one of my passions. I really enjoy doing it,\" said Zellie Kneller Kidigarden, a teacher and program director for Green Schools at Greensboro Elementary.\nThroughout the application process, the elementary schools have been able to produce multiple projects that help compost, save energy and grow fresh foods.\nOne project at Denton Elementary involves collecting breakfast bags in the morning after breakfast. According to Strange, the school lets third graders create boxes and put recycle signs on them to put in their classrooms to collect bags in the morning.\n\"Every day, we get breakfast in plastic bags per child, and our school is about 650 kids. So that's 650 bags that go in the trash every day,\" Strange said. \"The kids were so excited about it, and they did it... the kids are responsible for putting their bag in there when they're done their breakfast instead of throwing it in the trash.\"\nOne of the projects Greensboro Elementary conducts is planting in multiple gardens.\n\"We do strawberries, herbs in our garden tower and then we have our pollinator garden. Our Environmental Club also planted native plants everywhere in our swales. Before the end of the school year, we're going to plant native plants in our courtyard,\" Kneller said.\nKneller credits community partners for being helpful in their pursuit to becoming a green school.\nSome of the organizations Greensboro Elementary has partnered with are Pickering Creek Audubon Center, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Tuckahoe State Park, Wetlands on Wheels and many more.\n\"I'm so grateful that we're a community school because being a community school allows us to work with... stakeholders in the community, and we get wonderful things from all the members in the community,\" Kneller said.\nGreensboro Elementary has been a green school since 2021 and will go through a renewal next year. The school has been able to secure multiple grants that will lead to future projects, including tree planting and much more.\nBoth Kneller and Strange believe every school should be Green School certified.\n\"It's really, really, really important work and every school should be green school certified,\" Kneller said. \"It is life-changing for a lot of students and adults and I would say everyone because this is the planet that we live on and everyone needs to learn how to take care of it because we don't have anywhere else to go.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lockerman Middle School Committee heard and addressed concerns at second meeting\n\n June 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 634\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 At the Lockerman Middle School Committee meeting Monday night, Robyn Toth, architect for the new Lockerman Middle School, confirmed that after the state's assessment, the current Lockerman Middle School building cannot be renovated, and the county will go with a new building.\"We've already reached out to the state and said the renovation of this existing facility as a school is not feasible,\" Toth said at the meeting. \"It is my understanding that (the current school is) going to become a community center. So, this building is going to stay. It's going to keep its history.\"\nThough it was never indicated as a preferred option, staying at the current site and renovating was left on the table at prior committee meetings and discussions on the new school.\nThe May meeting featured two potential locations for a new school, the first location would be behind North Caroline High School, and the second would be on Double Hills Road in Denton.\nAfter a public hearing at that meeting, the committee came back with models and options for the school at two potential new locations.\n\"There was a lot of feedback last time about the safety issue for buses coming and going, as well as parent drop off,\" Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"So, I think the architect did the best they could with the two existing locations that the county has told us to look at to kind of make them as usable as possible.\"\nThe presentation given Monday premiered three building layout options for the North Caroline High location and two options for the Double Hills Road location.\nThe North Caroline High design options included two plans for a two-story style building with wings separated by grade level. Though these designs for the building itself are identical, the building is located in different places on the lot in each design.\nOne option proposes relocating the North Caroline High baseball and softball fields to a different location. The other keeps the middle school on the left and everything belonging to the high school on the right side of the property.\nThe third design option would also involve relocating the fields and would also relocate the solar array on the site. The existing barn and fenced pasture would also be rebuilt in a new location.\nThis third option is a three-story building design, with each floor being a different grade level.\n\"The different locations on North Carolina High School was interesting,\" Simmons said. \"I think most of us in our heads ahead of time could envision it in one spot, but giving the flexibility of the options really opened up some some pathway.\"\nThe Double Hills Road location designs featured the two- and three-story options as at the North Caroline location.\nWhile both options propose that the solar panels currently at the site may need to be located another portion of the county property and that new pump station will need to be constructed, entrance options, building locations and parking locations are different.\n\"Double Hills Road with the new county road going in in that property does preserve a 20 plus acre plot for to use,\" Simmons said. \"It's good location but again it gives us that flexibility now to see what the buses would look like coming and going. What drop off would look like, what staff parking would look like because there's nowhere near enough staff parking here as well.\"\nNow that the Lockerman Middle School Committee has presented all options, the public will have until before June 9 to respond to an online survey with their comments.\nThe top ranked designs for both locations will be presented to the Caroline County Board of Education in July. Then the Board of Education will make a decision on a location no later than August to make sure the timeline for construction stays on track.\nTo participate in the survey, visit carolineschools.org/article/2241492.\n. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I did things I swore I wouldn't ever do because of you all,\" Dennis said. \".... Most importantly, I returned to teaching because of you.\"\nDyAsia Thompson, senior class president was brought to tears during her speech to the class as she reflected on experience Covid-19 and multiple memories together.\n\"I honestly would not have wanted to share this journey with any other group of people,\" Thompson said. \"The bonds we formed and the memories we've created will last a lifetime, and I am beyond grateful and proud of each and every one of you.\"\nWilson Clough was highlighted as the class valedictorian. Clough took the time to recognize his class guidance counselor, Ms.Reed. It was her birthday on graduation day and he song her praises on behalf of the class before his speech.\nEach year, Caroline County honors graduates who have decided to join the military. This year Colonel Richardson had two graduates who plan to join the military.\nNorth Caroline High School\nThe following evening, 274 seniors walked the stage at North Caroline High School. North Caroline set up an overflow watching area in the auditorium, from which multiple guest watched their love ones graduate.\nAmong with the 274 graduates, there were 10 sets of twins.\nKeynote Speaker Marnie Stockman, CEO of multiple business and co-author of \"Lead it like Lasso,\" gave graduates advice on how to run their live like a business. She listed six things to think about to run the department of \"You Incorporated.\"\n\"Don't wait for life to pick you; you're not a raffle ticket.

    "content": "Trump wiped out 75 years of science leadership\n\n June 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 770\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. higher educational system may in future years lose $38 billion a year. This is the estimated annual contribution by foreign students to the operation of that system. In the school year 2023-2024 it was estimated that 1.1 million foreign students were studying at universities across the U.S., and they generally pay full fare or do work/study. They also supported about 378,000 academic jobs. In the past the U.S. was a magnet for a global brain-drain of university and post-graduate students.Now we risk driving them away.\nWe have all heard about the graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student from Syria, attending Columbia University and Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish female graduate student attending Tufts University. Both were grabbed by immigration authorities in the Northeast and sent to prisons in Louisiana awaiting outcomes of lawsuits filed on their behalf. They are both accused of peacefully protesting against the war in Gaza.\nOn April 19th CNN reported that thousands of international students across the country were informed by email that their student visas were revoked. Six days later the Trump administration decided to restore 1,400 student visas and let their lives go back to normal. How many students did not have their visas restored is unknown. We do know that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had a list of about 300 students that he planned to expel. The National Immigration Project is challenging the visa cancellations in court.\nApart from the money that these foreign students bring in, why would we care? Because foreign students began many of the successful startups in Silicon Valley. We care because much research in science done at our universities has brought the U.S. to a revered leadership position in the world in medical science research as well as research in other sciences. With a stroke of the president's pen this may all disappear. The best brains in the world will not want to come here anymore.\nIn the 20th century up to World War II, Germany won about 30% of the Nobel Prizes in science. The winner of the Nobel Prize in science is decided by a group of Swedish scientists. Alfred Nobel was a Swedish scientist who invented dynamite. His fortune funds all Nobel Prizes. The second runner-up was Great Britain with 20% of the Nobel Prizes in science. The U.S. was way down the list with only 6% of the Nobel Prizes in science.\nWhat turned the tide was Adolf Hitler who drove many of the best German scientists, artists and architects (some of them Jewish) to U.S. universities in the 1930s, where they were welcomed. The second German brain drain happened immediately after the war when U.S. intelligence invited physicists like Wernher von Braun (inventor of the German rockets) to the U.S. to work for the space program. World War II destroyed much of Germany and devastated Great Britain and France. The Soviet Union lost nearly 24 million people in that war, while the U.S. emerged from the war economically, technologically and militarily better than the rest of the world.\nWhat really propelled the U.S. into a leadership position was the futuristic vision of what could come, if the U.S. government funded basic research at universities small and large around the country with a promise to keep the government's hands off. The academic freedom and competition created by this decision attracted the best brains from around the world.\nSince 2000 the U.S. has won 72 Nobel Prizes in science, of which about 30% were won by immigrants. Great Britain won 16, Germany 7, France 5, Japan 9, Israel 5. Canada, Australia and Norway won three each. China is gaining ground.\nThis rosy picture will change fast if the Trump administration continues to threaten leading universities with withdrawal of funds and academic freedom. Harvard University, which so far has not backed down, was threatened with withdrawal of their not-for-profit designation, which would make any charitable donations taxable. Foreign students' and researchers' visas are being revoked. Foreigners are being harassed at U.S. entry points and their phones searched for anti-Trump emails.\nThe Trump administration is now threatening withdrawal of funds from our world-renowned science research facilities, The National Science Foundation, established in 1950, and the National Institutes of Health, established much earlier. A science publication asked its readers if they were affected by government harassment and withdrawal of funds. If so, were they considering moving their research elsewhere? 75% of the 1,600 who responded said they were considering it.\nWith a stroke of the president's pen, we have lost 75 years of leadership in the sciences.\nCalifornia, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York will see the most economic impact, but Maryland will also suffer. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Stroke of pen loses 75 years of science leadership\n\n June 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 713\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. higher educational system may in future years lose $38 billion a year. This is the estimated annual contribution by foreign students. In the school year 2023-2024 it was estimated that 1.1 million foreign students were studying at universities across the U.S., and they generally pay full fare or do work/study. They supported about 378,000 academic jobs.Now we risk driving them away.\nOn April 19, CNN reported that thousands of international students across the country were informed by email that their student visas were revoked. Six days later the Trump administration decided to restore 1,400 student visas. How many students did not have their visas restored is unknown. We do know that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had a list of about 300 students that he planned to expel. The National Immigration Project is challenging the visa cancellations in court.\nApart from the money that these foreign students bring in, why would we care? Because foreign students began many of the successful startups in Silicon Valley. We care because much research in science done at our universities has brought the U.S. to a revered leadership position in the world in medical science research.\nWith a stroke of the president's pen this may all disappear. The best brains in the world will not want to come here anymore. Research in advanced cancer treatments, drugs to treat Alzheimer, sudden crib deaths as well as CRISPRs use in treating genetic blood disorders by cutting out a person's faulty DNA will not continue without federal support. The U.S. inventors of CRISPR won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2020. We will be taking a giant step backward in the sciences.\nIn the 20th century up to World War II, Germany won about 30% of the Nobel Prizes in science. The second runner-up was Great Britain with 20% of the Nobel Prizes in science. The U.S. was way down the list with only 6% of the Nobel Prizes in science.\nWhat turned the tide was Adolf Hitler who drove many of the best German scientists, artists and architects (some of them Jewish) to U.S. universities in the 1930s, where they were welcomed. The second German brain drain happened immediately after the war when U.S. intelligence invited physicists like Wernher von Braun (inventor of the German rockets) to the U.S. to work for the space program. The U.S. emerged from the war economically, technologically and militarily better than the rest of the world.\nWhat really propelled the U.S. into today's leadership position was the futuristic vision of what could come, if the U.S. government funded basic research at universities small and large around the country with a promise to keep the government's hands off. The academic freedom and competition created by this decision attracted the best brains from around the world.\nSince 2000, the U.S. has won 72 Nobel Prizes in science, of which about 30% were won by immigrants. Great Britain won 16, Germany 7, France 5, Japan 9, Israel 5. Canada, Australia.and Norway won three each.\nThis rosy picture will change fast if the Trump administration continues to threaten leading universities with withdrawal of funds and academic freedom. Harvard University, which so far has not backed down, was threatened with cancellation of its not-for-profit designation. $2 billion in research grants were withdrawn by the administration. Foreign students' and researchers' visas are being revoked. 27% of the students are from abroad. Attacking an elite university may appeal to the MAGA base, but it is still difficult to understand why President Trump wants to destroy the foremost academic institution in the US!\nThe Trump administration also is threatening withdrawal of funds from our other world-renowned science research facilities, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. A science publication asked its readers if they were affected by government harassment and withdrawal of funds. If so, were they considering moving their research elsewhere? 75% of the 1,600 who responded said they were considering it.\nWith a stroke of the president's pen, we have lost 75 years of leadership in the sciences.\nCalifornia, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York will see the most economic impact. Maryland also will suffer, as we are home to Johns Hopkins Hospital, the site of original cancer research and treatment, and the University of Maryland Medical Center with its world-renowned Shock Trauma Center. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She plans to attend Towson University and major in nursing starting in the fall. She will already be multiple semesters ahead.\nEnnals' love for health care came during her freshman year of high school, but she decided she wanted to be a neonatal intensive care unit nurse during her sophomore year.\n\"When I just like actually sat down and was able to research and just gather data on all these different branches, that's what really like sealed the deal for me,\" she said.\nEnnals is not the first child of her mother, Maria Bowser, to participate in the dual enrollment program at Chesapeake College. Ennals' two older sisters participated in the program in Talbot County, both graduating with a plethora of college credits to pursue nursing.\nEnnals knew from watching her sisters complete dual enrollment classes that the workload was difficult, but she knew she was up to the task.\nEnnals said she faced challenges getting enrolled in the courses she needed.\nAfter an auditorium presentation with all juniors at North Caroline explaining dual enrollment options, Ennals went to her guidance counselor to talk about the process of doing dual enrollment and potentially graduating from Chesapeake College before graduating from high school.\n\"I tried to bring it up to my guidance counselor and they kind of deterred me from taking the dual enrollment classes, and that's when we decided to have a meeting about that and that's what got me into those classes,\" Ennals said.\n\"My guidance counselor told me that it was going to be too hard for me, which I was very confused as to why they would think that because I was already ahead when I first came to that school.\"\nBowser and Ennals met with counselors at North Caroline for several weeks about what course work would be best for Ennals.\n\"If she wants to be a nurse, and she knows she's going to college, college classes are the better path for her. However, we got a little pushback,\" Bowser said.\nA representative from Caroline County Public Schools said the district was unable to discuss conversations between students, parents and employees.\nAfter more pushback, Bowser and Ennals began to work with the Gabrilla Moreland, TRIO Upward Bound academic coordinator, and Mark Berry, director of TRIO program at Chesapeake College.\nThe TRIO Upward Bound program offers high school students from Caroline, Kent and Talbot counties an opportunity to gain college and career readiness skills, through tutoring, workshops and field trips at no cost to students.\nThe group set down with county Board of Education and came up with a plan to allow Enalls to take four college classes during her junior year of high school.\n\"I wasn't taking the 'no she can't take classes because it's too hard.' How was it too hard? She had a 4.0, and she was managing everything and had all of her high-school credits by her 11th grade year,\" Bowser said.\nEnnals said it became a \"prove them wrong type of situation.\"\n\"I loved it because it was a lot of motivation knowing that there were education officials telling me that I can't do something. So I just used that as motivation to just let me get through it. Let me kind of not only prove to myself but also prove to them,\" Ennals said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Board members said the debt likely stems from families choosing not to pay or failing to submit annual free/reduced lunch forms.\nThe school system did not respond for more information by deadline.\n\"These are families who make above whatever the threshold is to qualify and they are able to pay for lunch. They are able to pack their student's lunch. \u2026 There are options,\" board member Jamila Smith said. \"It's a choice just not to pay.\"\nThe board provided school principals lists of students with outstanding balances to contact families, encouraging repayment plans and assisting with lunch forms.\n\"And we do recognize that families are in different situations now, given that there are work closures, reductions in force, a variety of things that are happening,\" Smith said. \"But this has been going on well before that even began.\"\nBoard member Samichie Thomas emphasized the importance of filling out the lunch forms every year, or the school does not know if a family qualifies for the program that reimburses the school system for low-income students' lunches.\n\"I was a parent of four. You get all these forms and all these things at the beginning of the school year,\" Thomas said. \"Make sure you take the time to fill out the form because that's how the school can help you. \u2026 You can do it online.\"\nThe board is now considering stronger actions, including possibly sending unpaid debts to collections. The board will revisit the issue in July once the end-of-year payment window closes and final figures are available, giving families until end of June to pay their outstanding balance.\nFor now, board members are stressing outreach at every level to make families aware.\nBoard member Dottery Butler-Washington said, \"You have to say something three or four times for somebody to actually get it.\"\nThe full transfer plan vote is set for July when actual figures replace projections.\nNew substitute bus wages OK'dThe school board unanimously approved a raise for substitute bus drivers, boosting hourly wages.\nNew wages will be between $20 and 22.50, up $2.50 per hour. The increase, tied to 2026 budget, keeps pay competitive with full-time drivers and will cost an estimated $20,000 extra. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Despite the weather, the event had drawn over 1,000 attendees by noon, which was rapidly approaching last year's 1,200 attendee total, according to North East Library Branch Manager Jennifer Carter.\n\"In my opinion, it's the best thing we do all year,\" said Carter.\nEach family selected a free book upon arrival, and then was free to speak to the many children's authors present, or take part in the numerous activities on offer. These ranged from magic shows to facepainting to musical performances.\nLocal author Annette Whipple, a former Elkton and North East resident who now lives in nearby Oxford, Pa., said that the change in venue didn't seem to affect the enthusiasm at the event.\n\"It's been incredible. The families have turned out in full,\" Whipple said. \"Although we are inside, it hasn't dampened our spirts at all.\"\nWhipple, whose bibliography features such titles as \"Woof! The Truth About Dogs\" and \"Scurry! The Truth About Spiders\", writes what she calls \"fact-filled, fun\" books.\n\"I think facts are fun,\" said Whipple. \"So I write nonfiction for kids. And I love animals.\"\nWhile many of the activities and authors were popular among attendees, little could compare to the crowds near the water ice and ice cream trucks that set up shop on the street.\nMembers of the Dolly Parton Imagination Library were present at the event, helping families sign up for the program and conducting surveys of members. According to them, the festival was a great example of the Imagination Library's mission to get kids reading at a young age.\n\"The crowd here shows the county's families are interested,\" said Sharon Rosenberg. \"It's a tribute to the libraries themselves. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Foundation of HOPE's new building to expand middle school girls program\n\n June 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 559\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Since 2017, the Foundation of HOPE has grown into a beloved nonprofit in the Easton community, building bright futures for middle school girls. Soon, the foundation will have its own building.A project to create a dedicated Foundation of HOPE space on the corner of South Washington and South streets is moving along after the Easton Planning Commission approved its site plan Tuesday.\nFounder and President Keasha Haythe remembers comments made by the first girls she welcomed into the organization's after-school program eight years ago.\n\"They said, 'Ms. Keasha, are we going to have our own space?'\" recalled Haythe, who also serves on the Talbot County Council.\nA building wasn't always in the cards, Haythe said, but in 2020, she and the nonprofit's board realized a separate space could be beneficial. Since schools shut down, and that's where the program's classes took place, the program was put on hold during the pandemic.\n\"If something like this happens again, it would be better if we have our own space,\" Haythe said.\nFor nearly a decade, the foundation has brought on a cohort of sixth grade girls each spring to engage in programming on economic development, entrepreneurship and self-confidence. The girls are followed through high school, and some that are heading off to college receive scholarships.\nThe after-school program would typically take place in Easton Middle School. Most recently, Haythe's nonprofit added St. Michaels Middle School and 10 students to the cohort.\nNow, the Foundation of HOPE is planning its own 5,200-square-foot, two-story building. It's a $2.2 million project, with over $1.8 million already raised, Haythe said. Construction could begin as soon as September.\nOnce it opens, girls from Easton Middle would be within walking distance to attend the after-school program, and Haythe hopes for St. Michaels students to be bussed to Easton. Expansion will occur, too.\n\"I've had parents reach out from private schools as well,\" Haythe said. \"I do believe the building will allow us to open it up to those that may be home-schooled as well.\"\nPlanning Commission members complimented the design work done by the Foundation of HOPE and architect Crosby & Associates, saying it fit the commercial character of South Washington Street but didn't stick out too much from the residential homes on South Street.\n\"Fantastic job with this site design,\" said Vice Chair Michael Ports. \"It's a perfect transition to these two different areas. It's quite awesome.\"\nDuring discussion, some concerns about safety were raised, stemming from the South Washington and South streets vehicular intersection and the fact there aren't marked crosswalks.\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh said independent of the project, the town is aware of those safety concerns and is looking to improve the intersection for pedestrians, bicyclists and vehicles.\nWhile the nonprofit has obtained OKs from the Planning and Historic District Commissions, Haythe noted there are still steps left in the approval process, including permits.\nBut the building may soon be a reality for future cohorts of girls. Along with office space, Haythe envisions a reading room, fun area, cooking lessons and much more for the sixth graders. And it could help spark even more excitement from the students once they have a building to call the Foundation of HOPE home.\n\"For them to come to the classroom for the after-school program, it's asking a lot of them to stay in that building until we're done with our sessions,\" Haythe said. \"This will break that up.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He noted that during interviews, she indicated interest in owning her own business one day.\nThe apprenticeship comes at a time when he says the company is on a mission to get girls and young women involved in the construction and building industry and empower them to go after job opportunities in similar fields.\nOlde School Builders has recently partnered with Easton Middle School to run a Girls Who Build club. Postlewait said this past spring, the students who joined were hesitant at first but left feeling more confident and comfortable.\nOn June 16, Postlewait expressed excitement to welcome Escalante-Garcia on board for the summer and following school year. He said he wants people and young girls to gain that confidence in areas that may, at times, not be considered by most high schoolers.\n\"We're so happy to have her with us,\" Postlewait said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bonnie Shively, pastor of St. Paul's, came up with the idea as a way to serve the community.\n\"I've never done any school drive or a shoe drive before,\" Shively said. \"I was talking with a couple other folks, and we were kicking around the idea of maybe doing a backpack drive. So, that led to a conversation of wondering what kind of school supplies the kids need at the beginning of the year.\"\nShively then contacted Greensboro Elementary to see what supplies would be needed and got the answer of new shoes for students.\n\"One of the things that was shared is that so many kids start out the school year, the kids don't get new school shoes like a lot of us did when we were growing up. So, that's kind of how it came about and it's a unique idea,\" Shively said.\nThe church is accepting new shoes from sizes 7 toddler to size 6 adults. The only shoes that will not be accepting are flip flops.\nShively said the church is excited to do something for the community and hopes the shoe drive will be positive.\n\"I think it's a really good feeling when we can help out the kids,\" Shively said. \"Certainly, getting the various groups together in the community to come together put this drive together. We're already looking at where this will lead us in regard to what are some other areas that we can partner together for our community.\"\nResidents can drop off new shoes at Greensboro Town Hall from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Monday through Friday until Aug. 29. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The board decided to push the decision back to the August meeting.\nMultiple reasons came forward on why the North Caroline High site was recommended over the Double Hills Road site.\n\"Some of the highlights that came out throughout the analysis and the surveys was again, the infrastructure. If you're not spending a lot of money on that, the site readiness, the educational alignment, a lot of really exciting ideas came out during the community meeting of ways that you could really have mentorships and things like that with the older and the younger students being on one site,\" said Robyn Toth, architect for the new school.\nReason included the use for indoor and outdoor activities and the ability to share space for events at North Caroline High.\n\"There's clear paths for the indoor and outdoor activities,\" Toth said. \"There's no crossing of streets, lots of capabilities there also because you are sharing more spaces\u2026 There were some concerns about large events and right now, if they're at Double Hills or if they're at Lockerman now, where do we go for these large events? That don't happen that often and you don't necessarily need to build more space that the state's not going to support. Well, you've got a high school right there that's got a large auditorium. It's got a large gym.\"\nWith the North Caroline High location, development prices will be about $500,000 cheaper. The site development for the North Caroline High location will be $10 million, while Double Hills Road would cost $10.5 million.\nAlthough in the community meetings multiple builds were shown, the new middle school, regardless of the location, will be a two-story building with a two-wing design.\nAccording to the Ed Specs Committee Powerpoint, the new anticipated project budget would be $103.82 million with state funding coming in at around $80 million and local funding covering the remainder.\nThe only concerns brought up about the North Caroline High site were the solar array on the property and the traffic Central Avenue could receive from a new school being added to the location.\nTo purchase the solar panels on the property, it would cost about $180,000, which doesn't include the cost of relocation.\nThe Board of Education will take all the information received and make a decision on what location will be picked at its August meeting. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

To further reduce the deficit, DCPS got rid of their after school and summer programs.\nThe county had to reduce staff sizing, but Superintendent Jymil Thompson said he wants to keep class sizes small and retain teachers at all costs.\nThe Board of Education has been making concerted efforts to move DCPS from 23rd out of 24 school districts \u2014 including Baltimore City \u2014 in state education ranking, but the federal funding cuts make those efforts more difficult.\n\"Moving forward, we will be proactively looking closely at unique ways to reallocate pre-existing funds to support the inclusion of these federally funded programs which are a major asset to Dorchester County Public Schools and the enrichment of its students,\" O'Bier said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The entire $50,000 cost is covered in this year's budget.Approved a five-year IXL learning contract for grades 3-12, which is budgeted at $23,000 for the current year and future payments must be budgeted in subsequent years.Approved Math Curriculum Consumables, which is paid from this year's textbook budget.Approved the annual contract with the Dorchester County Health Department school nurse contract.Approved the Facilities Master Plan Update which is necessary for capital improvement eligibility.\nBoard members did not renew or approve Lexia, a widely used computer-based literacy program designed to help students improve their reading skills, because of concerns and issues with its effectiveness like inaccurate data, lack of instructional alignment among teachers and staff, and its high cost.\nThe board will meet again in August to discuss policies regarding digital devices, AI and dress codes. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They got to record in a professional studio, a privilege and honor many musicians do not get the chance to have.The 28-year-old singer/songwriter, teacher and owner of Mooday's Music LLC, teacher said it was beneficial for her students to see the hard work behind the making of music while developing pride in their accomplishments.\nMooday explained that Ken Schweitzer, associate chair of the Department of Music at Washington College, had received a grant to record small independent artists at their studio. Schweitzer, knowing about Mooday's music, asked her to record something. Mooday was honored but did not have any new songs at the time.\nHowever, she did have students which the grant also allows for, Schweitzer pointed out.\nAfter learning three favorite and popular songs: Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\", \"OK Not To Be OK\" by Marshmello and Demi Lovato and \"Best Day of My Life\" by American Authors, students of Mooday's week-long class decided to go with the latter to record.\nOn 9 a.m. that Friday, students Mason Poulson, Abbie Donophan, Emma Christophel, Whitley Sparks, Micah Christophel, Hannah Sadler, Quinn Greenwell, Asher Sadler, Adah Sadler and Jezzy Greenwell stepped into the studio prepared.\nWashington College audio engineer students Stevie Lyles and Mariana Kilman got the equipment set up to record the students choice \"Best Day of my Life.\" Mooday, with assistance from guitar teacher Matt Wirtz and drum set instructor Emily Holden, said the tune was fun for the kids to learn. \"It's just catchy with two chords and a simple, fun drum pattern,\" she said.\nThe class recorded in parts. Micah Christophel posted up behind the drum set establishing the beat first. Next, Wirtz guided students on guitars and helped lay out the licks (musical phrases). Mooday assisted her kids on the ukuleles as well as vocals. All the while, she insisted they participate as much as possible which they were eager to do.\n\"All the kids played played a part in the process which was really cool. Every student sang when it came to lay down the vocals track as well.\"\nMooday said it was also important for them to see the hardworking people in the background behind some of their favorite songs. They were eyewitness to the engineers mixing the track, adding some reverb to their vocals and were amazed at the finished product.\nMooday took joy seeing the kids' confidence grow in the studio.\nThe entire recording, mixing and production process was efficient. They were in and out in two hours, Mooday said. The engineer students delivered the finished track to her in time to develop a slideshow to be presented to parents and students later that day for a final performance.\nThat same afternoon at Mooday's Music, the kids performed two songs, the one they had recorded and also \"OK Not To Be OK,\" receiving applause for their hard work and dedication.\nMooday was elated, appreciating the timing of Schweitzer's offer coordinating with her class schedule. \"It worked out so nicely,\" Mooday said. \"They are so young and for them to have this opportunity was amazing.\"\nNow in her sixth year teaching, music changed Mooday's life and at an early age she desired sharing that with others.\nMooday followed that passion, using some bleak times in her life to shape her faith and music. She has a B.S. in music education and B.A. in flute performance and Masters degree in music education with a certificate in modern band at Lebanon Valley College.\nThe intense years of music study allowed her to live out her dream, owning her own music classroom, passing on the lessons music taught her.\n\"I really enjoy the private lessons setting because it gives me a chance to work individually with a student, meeting their needs and helping them grow to not only play their chosen instrument, but also grow a love for music. I have a passion for working with students with higher needs and challenging myself to find what works best for their learning processes.\"\nAnd in the future, she will have more space to do that, adding on an extra 2,000 square feet, enabling her team to conduct two summer camps a year, with more room for private lessons, kid classes, and to teach homeschoolers.\nLearn more about Mooday's Music LLC by visiting her website, moodaysmusicllc.org, and be sure to check out all of her work, which includes albums, singles and EPs that date all the way back to 2017 on Spotify. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They got great skill.\"\nWith the school year approaching, the board of education wants to make a decision on the policy sooner rather than later. Board members agreed to get rid of the pouches, but they will likely come up with an alternative like locking student's personal devices in lockers or backpacks.\nThe board made a motion to pass the policy as a first read with the understanding that revisions will be made before the second read and final approval at the next meeting on Aug. 21 at 6 p.m. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Closing gaps': TCPS data shows some literacy, math improvements\n\n July 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 586\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Test score data from last school year is showing key math and English improvements for some Talbot County students, according to school officials.Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi presented data sets to the Board of Education last week. She's especially pleased with jumps for the district's Black and Hispanic students.\n\"We are closing gaps and moving the needle on the subgroups,\" Pepukayi said in an interview.\nSchool data from the Measures of Academic Progress, or MAP, testing program shows 68% of kindergarten students scored in the 50th percentile or above in math in the 2024-2025 school year. That's up from 54% the year prior.\nThe percent of students, sorted by grade, meeting or exceeding that 50th percentile for the math and ELA tests mostly increased across the board. Dips were seen for third and fifth graders in ELA performance.\nAnd in subgroups, there were many green arrows for Black and Hispanic students. For instance, both Black and Hispanic third graders saw a 31% year-to-year jump in testing at the 50th percentile mark or above in math, and a 21% year-to-year increase for that same mark in ELA.\n\"I'm really glad to see such improvement in the Latino and Black community. That's huge,\" said Board Member Deborah Bridges at the July 16 meeting.\nPepukayi attributes the hikes, in part, to improved curriculum and the dedication of Talbot County's teachers.\n\"I can't pinpoint to say that was it, but I think we're on the right track of students learning skills that are aligned to standards,\" Pepukayi said. \"And we're looking at students being proficient on standards versus just getting a grade.\"\nThe tests discussed at last week's board meeting included MAP testing and the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skill test. Statewide test scores typically are released in August or September.\nDIBELS scores weren't drastically different from the year prior. A higher percentage of rising first and third graders tested above the literacy benchmark in 2024-2025 than 2023-2024, but second graders above the benchmark dropped by 5%.\nIn the MAP testing, the percent of fifth graders meeting the 50th percentile for ELA dropped by 6.6%. That decrease was mirrored by ELA drops for fifth graders in the following subgroups: Hispanic students, students with disabilities, multilingual students and students on free and reduced meals.\nData also shows this year's incoming sixth-grade class performed 4.1% worse in ELA in fifth grade than they did in fourth grade.\n\"Fifth graders are the kids that didn't get to finish kindergarten because of COVID,\" noted Board Vice President Amy Dodson.\nPepukayi said the next step is to fix those trends by focusing on the elementary-to-middle transition. She said in an interview that TCPS is vying to fill open reading and math coach positions for the middle schools \u2014 roles that have been beneficial at the elementary schools.\n\"That's what we're working on,\" Pepukayi said. \"I would say that's probably the challenge, of getting our staff and finding the staff to really do the interventions needed in the middle-school levels.\"\nShe emphasized that schools are collecting data on a smaller, classroom scale in order to know what's working and what's not.\n\"While we still have work to do, I think we do have to celebrate the small wins,\" Pepukayi said.\nBoard President Emily Jackson thanked Pepukayi and administrators for diving deeper into the year-to-year trends.\n\"We have been asking for these kind of results for a long time,\" said Jackson, who's served on the board since 2018. \"And the way that you showed up with the full transparent picture of what is happening in our schools, I think is really important.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hip-Hop meets High Street\n\n July 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 764\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When headed down High Street in Chestertown toward the water, you may notice the building near Dixon Drive has gotten a little more colorful.Across the field, the side of 800 High Street is covered in graffiti-style art \u2014 checkered patterns, winding vines, sun rays and messages such as \"Labor of Love,\" alongside odes to the former Dixon Valve building and Vita Foods.\nThese were two former businesses located on the property \u2014 historic places with plenty of stories still to tell and a new generation beginning to learn about them.\nThe art is part of a two-week summer course called the Hip Hop Time Capsule. High school students from Cecil, Queen Anne's and Kent counties, along with Washington College student interns, were taught local history while exercising creativity in a way that merges both.\nThe project is spearheaded by Washington College's Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience, Chesapeake Heartland: An African American Humanities Project, and the Kohl Gallery, in partnership with Minary's Dream Alliance.\nOrganizers selected and supervised the students.\nFor two weeks, they worked with musicians, college professors and museum professionals to research, explore, document and interpret the rich history of African American music in Kent County.\nIn past years, students composed original tracks using digitized audio clips to build beats. They wrote lyrics or performed spoken word pieces and layered them over music, producing original songs complete with cover art.\nPat Nugent, director of civic engagement at Washington College, has led the innovative class for the past five years.\nAnd innovation is the name of the game. Since an innovation plant is being established at 800 High Street, organizers moved the Hip Hop Time Capsule program into the building \u2014 a natural fit, said Darius Johnson, director of the Starr Center's Chesapeake Heartland Project.\n\"We really wanted the students to feel like they have a stake in what we're doing here,\" Johnson said. \"So having it at the innovation plant just made sense. And the music is a great hook.\"\n\"Our student interns have come together to learn a number of skills and trades, to reflect on our community's past and future, and to make their mark on this evolving property at the heart of Chestertown,\" Nugent said.\n\"The tables, benches, murals, posters and music they designed and brought into being have enriched the site and will ensure the innovation plant becomes a vibrant crossroads for both campus and community.\"\nOrganizers pared down the original pool of 60 students to just under 40. Selected participants received an introduction to hip hop, explored local art, learned about the historic uptown area and studied the histories of Vita Foods and Dixon Valve.\nBased on survey responses, students were assigned to one of four tracks: music, murals, metalwork or screen printing, Johnson said.\nThey spent a two-hour workshop with an instructor from their chosen track. For example, Eastern Shore native Shelton Hawkins oversaw the murals and shared his experience beautifying basketball courts \u2014 a skill that has taken him across the globe, including painting the Golden State Warriors court.\nIn each workshop, students learned about the origins of hip hop, explored how to make their mark and practiced self-expression using modern technologies, Johnson added.\nThey also had access to 5,600 digitized materials of Black history \u2014 including photo albums, home movies, oral histories, interviews and documents dating back as early as the 1700s.\nThe class began July 14 and concluded Friday, July 25, when close to 100 children from the Horizons of Kent and Queen Anne's program attended a special event, broadening the program's reach and impact.\nParticipants were also paid for their involvement: high school students received $1,200 each and the 11 college interns received $1,422.\nJohnson said the students gained confidence from the experience.\n\"It has been a really beautiful process,\" he said. \"Students built trust, overcame fears, developed employable skills and analyzed their community with critical eyes.\"\nFor those who voiced concerns about the art on the building in historic Chestertown, Johnson offered reassurance.\nThe artwork is only temporary.\nIt served as a way for interns to express creativity and passion, engage in community outreach and strengthen local ties.\n\"We know that the foundation of a successful innovation plant has to be built on relationships and be responsive to community interests,\" said Sara Clarke-De Reza, chair of the education department at Washington College. \"Programs like Hip Hop Time Capsule help us imagine how this space might be best developed to meet the needs of the next generation of makers, innovators and entrepreneurs.\"\nThe program encourages students to become both civic leaders and innovative designers.\nFollow along with the continuing work of the innovation plant on Instagram: @wc_innovation_plant.

    "content": "Talbot, Kent see rise in student homelessness\n\n July 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 674\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 State numbers show youth homelessness on the rise in parts of the Eastern Shore. Local shelters aiding families and single parents are noticing similar trends.Data from the Maryland State Department of Education shows Kent and Talbot counties had the largest year-to-year increase, by percentage, of students experiencing homelessness.\nIn the 2022-2023 school year, Kent County reported 66 homeless students; in 2023-2024, it took a 55% jump to 102 students. Talbot County's increase rate was 39%; 233 students experienced homelessness in 2022-2023, and 324 students in 2023-2024.\nCounts for 2024-2025 haven't yet been released \u2014 the most recent data was published in February \u2014 but leaders of nonprofit shelters have been seeing the increases in recent months.\n\"We are definitely seeing an increase in calls for families needing shelter,\" said Julie Lowe, executive director of Talbot Interfaith Shelter.\nLast school year, Easton-based Talbot Interfaith housed 31 children, Lowe said. That's a \"steady increase,\" she noted, though the shelter is limited on how many families it can help due to high demand, requirements for shelter residents and bedroom sizes.\nJust three of Maryland's 24 districts saw a year-to-year drop in student homelessness, state data shows. The counts are collected as required by the federal McKinney-Vento Act, which ensures students experiencing homelessness receive an education.\nA reason for the increase in Kent County is that school staff are better trained to identify the students defined as homeless under the McKinney-Vento Act, according to Kent County Public Schools spokesperson Dan Divilio.\n\"Homelessness in Kent County looks different from the common perception of someone living on the street or in a car,\" Divilio wrote in an email. \"Unhoused students often still have a roof over their head at night, but it may belong to an extended family member or a family friend.\"\nDivilio added that in addition to free school meals and the efforts of social workers and counselors, the district maintains partnerships with local organizations that serve families and children in need.\nTalbot County Public Schools officials say the pandemic has played a role in the increased count.\n\"The number of students experiencing homelessness is generally a reflection of the current economic climate in the nation, state, and region,\" a statement from the district read. \"The increase from SY 22-23 to SY 23-24, which is evident in the data for nearly all Maryland School Districts, was largely due to economic challenges faced by many families following the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\nIn Talbot, around 7% of students are homeless under the McKinney-Vento report, per state enrollment data. Nearly 6% of Kent County's 1,700-plus students experienced homelessness.\nThose marks in other Eastern Shore districts like Dorchester (3.6%), Queen Anne's (2.9%) and Caroline (2.2%) are lower, but the need to help the youth still remains, nonprofit leaders say.\nStefanie Johnson, executive director of the Denton-based shelter His Hope Ministries, has seen an increase in families and single parents seeking assistance, too.\nThe McKinney-Vento data for Kent County doesn't come as a shock to her. And Divilio, the KCPS spokesperson, noted that the district's count for 2024-2025 is 108 children, including children enrolled K-12 and toddlers in the district's early learning programs.\n\"Absolutely a lot more calls coming to us from Kent County, so I'm not really surprised by that unfortunately,\" Johnson said.\nShelters on the Eastern Shore are moving to assist homeless youth, but helping that age range comes with its own unique set of obstacles.\nJohnson said a specific challenge in the 13- to 18-year-old range is that her shelter can't take on children without some sort of guardianship or family present.\n\"With that 18 to 25 (age range), it's a little easier to kind of help them navigate,\" Johnson said.\nLowe said the Talbot Interfaith Shelter serves many single parents \u2014 some of them with two or three kids. The shelter offers life skills and job readiness assistance, as well as a transitional program for people to begin paying partial rent before being able to graduate to full payments.\nBut with the murky affordability of rentals in the area, Lowe said it's not always easy for families to make that transition.\n\"Homelessness is a housing problem,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In 1931, the school was named after Joseph H. Lockerman, a Black educator who was born 1862 near Denton.\nThe school remained Joseph H. Lockerman High School until 1966, when the school closed its doors as a Black high school and became the integrated Riverview Middle School.\nThe Lockerman name was restored in 1993 at a Lockerman Middle School pre-dedication ceremony, which highlighted the history of Lockerman School.\nThe president of the Caroline County Board of Education at the time was George W. Fisher. William D. Brown was president of the Concerned Friends of Lockerman, the forerunner of the current Lockerman Schools Association Inc.\nThe Lockerman Schools Association Inc. was established in 1993 as a nonprofit to engage in educational, literary or charitable activities that benefit students who have ties to any of the Lockerman Schools.\nWoods described the process of planning Saturday's event as honoring the past and addressing the present.\n\"You sort of share the vision, the idea, brainstorm with individuals and then begin to establish It's a working plan,\" Woods said. \"...Then we look at some things we want to recognize and honor. If you look at our theme, capturing our history what other kinds of things are happening or we're experiencing that we can bring to the forefront, so that our members and the community in general are aware and some of those were highlighted during the presentation of awards and certificates.\"\nMembers of classes 1935, 1945, 1955 and 1965 came to celebrate class anniversaries.\nWhile some members weren't able to attend, family members or friends accepted plaques and small trophies on their behalf. Caroline County and Board of Education officials attended the anniversary event.\nThe Lockerman Association also presented 13 scholarships to Caroline County students pursing higher education. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wayne Gilchrest, a longtime area resident, is working with Parks and Recreation on this horticulture program on county-owned land in Turner's Creek.\nAlmost directly across from the Kent County Museum, at the end of a dirt trail, there is a garden with 12 plots measuring 10 by 20 feet reserved for elementary and middle school students who attend summer camp.\n\"The kids have their own space to garden. They plant them and grow them,\" Gilchrest said. \"We supervise and give them the tools they need.\"\nTools like 40-gallon water drums and compost piles of hay, cedar chips, cow manure and food scraps.\nThey learn these skills, taught by expert growers including Gilchrest, University of Maryland Extension Agent Beth Hill, Maryland SNAP-Ed Nutrition Educator Eric Fitch, members of the University of Maryland Extension Master Gardener Program and several others.\nGilchrest, who has been growing crops the majority of his life, teaches kids their first lesson, pointing to the forest line full of mature trees and vegetation.\n\"I tell them, 'You see these woods? They don't need fertilizer to help them grow,'\" he said.\nThe key is to copy those same natural conditions in the garden, he said.\nAt the end of the school year, they met at the grounds. Bonnie's Plants donated tomato, squash, watermelon, pepper and many other plants. Kids chose what they wanted in their garden and planted it in the soil, using the mulch mixture of cedar chips donated from waterman Sam Joiner and cow manure from a nearby farm. Hay was also donated by Hopkins Game Farm.\nThis mixture sits for a year, decomposing and providing nutrients, phosphorus, calcium, potassium and minerals for the health of the plant. With hay surrounding the plant like a \"rug,\" stamped down properly to keep the weeds away, growing experts show campers how to foster their plant's growth.\nThe hay also attracts wolf spiders, Gilchrest added, providing a demonstration of how nature polices itself.\nHe explained wolf spiders are actually beneficial. They are predatory toward insects that like to chew on the vegetables and would otherwise kill the plant.\nWith predatory bugs, healthy compost and weed control, kids learn how to prepare their gardens for harvest.\n\"I say to anybody, if they know a little about photosynthesis and the living soil, you can be a farmer,\" Gilchrest said.\nHe explains to the kids that photosynthesis, the process that green plants use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water, is essential to growth.\nWhen the sun hits a green plant, it creates glucose, which is used by the plant for energy and growth.\nHe said they learn about soil health creating a vital ecosystem for all living things.\nIn the example of the sunlight hitting the plant, bacteria then eat the glucose, or plant sugar, that the plant produces, and then other things eat the bacteria, and through waste removal, establishes a cycle of growth to nourish everything \u2014 plant, animal and human.\nThese important lessons are being taught to kids who, when out there, are focused.\n\"The kids are amazing. They take to this stuff like blue to the sky,\" Gilchrest said, smiling.\nAnd when visitors are there, they know they have something important to impart. For example, Hill helps them identify bugs beneficial to the plants and harmful to them.\n\"The kids were so excited. Some said 'here comes the bug lady!'\" Gilchrest said, chuckling.\nHill pointed out that they have been identifying and talking about insects as they find them, including dogbane beetles, butterflies (tiger swallowtails, zebra swallowtails, monarchs and black swallowtails), damselflies and dragonflies, bees, squash bugs and striped cucumber beetles.\n\"We have also looked at fungus, weeds, birds, native plants and more. It's been a lot of fun and the kids and counselors are terrific,\" Hill added.\nWith Fitch there every Monday and Thursday, Hill's visits and the Master Gardeners as regulars, the campers are in good hands \u2014 hands with green thumbs.\n\"Everyone has been very helpful. This has been a good program of everyone coming together,\" Gilchrest said.\nThe program is in its second year with aims to expand, possibly adding a solar-powered well 100 feet deep so they do not have to rely on water drums.\n\"Hopefully there is much more to come in the near future,\" Gilchrest said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The site puts the new middle school right next to North Caroline High School, giving the county its second location with a middle school and high school on the same property.\nThe North Caroline High site will allow 15.52 acres of space for the build of Lockerman Middle. The exact location of the building on the site has not been determined yet.\nAt the previous Board of Education meeting in July, multiple reasons came forward on why the North Caroline High site was recommended over a Double Hills Road site that was also being considered.\n\"Some of the highlights that came out throughout the analysis and the surveys was, again, the infrastructure. If you're not spending a lot of money on that, the site readiness, the educational alignment, a lot of really exciting ideas came out during the community meeting of ways that you could really have mentorships and things like that with the older and the younger students being on one site,\" said Robyn Toth, architect for the new school, in July.\nReason included the ability to share space for events at North Caroline High.\n\"There's clear paths for the indoor and outdoor activities,\" Toth said. \"There's no crossing of streets, lots of capabilities there also because you are sharing more spaces\u2026 There were some concerns about large events and right now, if they're at Double Hills or if they're at Lockerman now, where do we go for these large events? That don't happen that often and you don't necessarily need to build more space that the state's not going to support. Well, you've got a high school right there that's got a large auditorium. .\"\nBill Mengel, director of operations for Caroline County Public Schools, said the only concern with the North Caroline High site is the solar array on the property. The county has been in conversation with Tesla to purchase the solar array. No official purchase has been made yet.\nTo purchase the solar panels on the property, it would cost about $180,000, which doesn't include the cost of relocation.\nBoard members said the decision on the location was a very early step in a marathon of decisions before the new school will be built. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This could be circle time, like in preschools, or learning in small group interactions like sharing.\n\"Having that opportunity for social interaction and developing meaningful peer relationships is really important, especially at the preschool level,\" Marshall said.\nDuring a child's first visit, SPARKS ABA does an initial assessment, which tells them how many hours a week a child needs to visit.\nPrograms aim to change the trajectory of a child's learning so they can catch up to their peers with the duration of treatment being measured in six-month increments.\n\"We want to try and get as many learning opportunities in as possible,\" Marshall said. \"The goal that we have is therapy to be part of their everyday life.\"\nApplied behavioral analysis looks at three things, Marshall said.\n\"Applied\" considers problems or skills people have and looks for solutions based on positive teaching opportunities. SPARKS ABA takes guidance from science to inform their practice.\n\"Behavior\" looks at things SPARKS ABA can see and measure. They focus on the individual, which includes looking at social interactions, language and navigating sensory issues.\n\"Analysis\" evaluates data on the child to ensure the goals that were selected are changing.\n\"We know we're doing a good job when we've worked ourselves out of a job,\" Marshall said.\nSPARKS ABA plans to have a Halloween-themed \"Truck-or-Treat\" open house on Oct. 25 from noon to 2 p.m.\nFor more information about the business, visit www.sparksaba.com. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Horses are my happy place': Horse rescue welcomes student readers\n\n August 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARTY MADDEN mmadden@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 554\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n If you love to read and you love horses, there's a local rescue organization working in partnership with Calvert public schools that will give you a chance to combine those passions.\"I love horses,\" Morgan Chambers, 9, of Huntingtown said. \"Horses are my happy place.\"\n\"She would rather spend every waking moment in a barn,\" Melissa Chambers said of her daughter's unabashed affection for the noble animals.\nDuring an early August afternoon, Morgan, a student at Calvert Elementary, was one of several youngsters who used some summer vacation time at Freedom Hill Horse Rescue in Owings to read a book or two for the enjoyment of several of the facility's 10 retired equines.\nClutching a copy of \"Harry the Dirty Dog,\" the nearly 70-year-old Gene Zion classic, Morgan Chambers prepared to read to Apollo, a 29-year-old quarter horse.\nAlthough Freedom Hill has been almost the exclusive venue for the program (another facility, Traveller's Rest Farm Sanctuary in Hughesville has also hosted reading to horses events), school officials said the strategy could be used for just about any animal.\nMarcy Gruver, who currently serves as Calvert County Public Schools' coordinator of Blueprint for Maryland's Future, told Southern Maryland News the local program is called \"Read to the Animals.\" It's a similar initiative as one that was done in Baltimore County.\nCalvert's Read to the Animals program is available for kindergarten to fifth-grade students.\n\"We've almost been fully booked every time\" an event is held at the sanctuary, she said.\n\"The approach fosters reading fluency in a calm, supportive setting while also helping animals become more comfortable with human interaction,\" Gruver said. \"Students also learn the value of service and compassion. Increased community presence at rescue centers can positively impact adoption rates and generate greater awareness and support for these organizations.\"\nAccording to Gruver, school officials also reached out to local shelters housing dogs, cats and smaller animals, who graciously declined \"due to staffing constraints and high intake numbers.\"\n\"It shows the students really caring about the animals,\" Melissa Huffman, supervisor of elementary English language arts, said.\n\"We're trying to do more outreach within the community,\" Beth Meader, the secretary of the Freedom Hill Horse Rescue board said. Of the Read to the Animals program, she added, \"It's a win-win for the children.\"\n\"The kids seem to enjoy it and the horses seem to enjoy it,\" Lori Harrington, Freedom Hill's board president, said.\nIn its mission statement, the nonprofit's members affirm their dedication to \"rescuing horses from neglect, abuse, abandonment and slaughter. We strive to improve the lives of horses by providing a haven for healing and rehabilitation.\"\nFounded 21 years ago, Freedom Hill Horse Rescue is located on the grounds of historic Hampton Manor.\nReaching out to youth and adult organizations, Harrington said, has become a major focus at Freedom Hill. In addition to public schools, the organization also partners with homeschool groups, Scouts, first responders and veterans organizations.\nFreedom hill hosts \"about two or three programs a month,\" Harrington said, adding that no programs are held during cold weather months.\nMeader said there is hope the reading initiative might inspire some of the participants to consider volunteering when they are older. A Freedom Hill volunteer must be 13 or older.\nGruver said Meader and the other volunteers at Freedom Hill \"have gone above and beyond to prepare the horses for student visits.\"\nFor more information on Freedom Hill Horse Rescue, go to www.fhhr.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot school officials discuss AI guidelines for students, teachers\n\n August 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 659\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Talbot County school district leaders aren't only focusing on how to moderate student use of artificial intelligence \u2014 they're looking to teachers, too.New guidelines discussed at a Board of Education work session Monday encourage teachers and staff to use AI responsibly. But AI shouldn't be used as a replacement for lesson planning or decision-making, said Robin Werner, the district's director of teaching and learning.\n\"It should be enhancing our instruction, but human oversight is imperative,\" Werner said. \"We are not using it to replace any positions or staff members, but it is really a guiding tool that can help teachers.\"\nOn Monday, Werner presented an AI guidelines document to be observed this school year. While not a formal policy, the document lays out how the district's schools, teachers, staff and students should use AI.\nStaff are encouraged to be transparent, and Werner said students should be comfortable asking when they can use AI tools.\nAVOIDING THE 'GRAY AREA'\nA committee of Talbot County teachers and administrators began researching AI last fall and developed the guidelines this winter. They visited the district's middle and high schools this spring to consult with teachers.\n\"Our goal is to ensure that AI empowers students and staff while maintaining academic integrity, equity and human oversight,\" Werner told board members.\nBoard members on Monday weighed whether to rely solely on the guidelines or consider adopting official policy changes. Policies and administrative regulations must be approved by the board.\nTalbot County Public Schools' work to regulate AI comes as Werner said the State Department of Education is lagging behind other states in creating AI rules.\nTCPS academic integrity and plagiarism policies are tied to state rules, which hasn't been updated to include new AI provisions, Werner said. Revising Talbot's official policies before any state updates wouldn't be prudent, she said.\n\"My suggestion would be that we wait until the state updates their code of conduct, and then we could avoid having to update it more than once,\" Werner said.\nBut Board President Emily Jackson said that while she understands AI is ever-evolving, a policy could spell out the standards more clearly.\n\"If we don't have solid policy to lean back on \u2026 I find it gets stickier and into that gray area,\" Jackson said.\nBoard member Dyshekia Strawberry agreed, and recommended the board adopt an AI policy, even if broad in nature, as the district waits for clearer advice from the state.\n\"Just to set some safety standards, such as not uploading any confidential information,\" Strawberry said.\nJackson suggested the policy committee bring back an AI policy or administrative regulation to the board at a future date.\nSTUDENT RULES\nDespite not being an official policy, the guidelines highlight some specific rules that students and teachers should follow.\nAI is prohibited when used to plagiarize or bully, Werner said.\nWerner said the district will be piloting a rubric scaled from 0-4 this year for students. Teachers, if they wish, can notate certain assignments in one of the following categories:\n0, AI cannot be used.1, AI can support ideas and brainstorming. Disclosure statement on how it was used is required.2, AI can assist in editing but not creating new material. Disclosure statement and link to AI chats must be included when work is submitted.3, AI can complete a specific task approved by the teacher. AI chats must be disclosed, and AI-created content must be properly cited.4, AI can be fully used as a \"co-pilot\" with human oversight. AI chats must be disclosed, and AI-created content must be properly cited.\nWerner said staff appreciated the rubric, which was adapted from guidelines in North Carolina.\nThe district is encouraging that misuse of AI be \"teachable moments\" instead of automatic jumps to discipline, Werner said. That will give the students a \"clear understanding on how AI can be used to enhance their education, not replace it,\" she said.\nThis year, members of Talbot's AI committee will be visiting elementary schools. Werner said it's \"imperative\" to stay on top of the issue and provide the best guidance to the district's youngest learners. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright 2025",

The turnout, though, remained steady. Kids picked up supplies, played indoor games like cornhole and enjoyed free snow cones.\nCarly Palmer, For All Seasons' outreach coordinator, said 800 backpacks were prepared for the event with help from the Talbot County Department of Social Services.\nThose that weren't given away Wednesday will be delivered to local schools, Palmer said.\nShe added that the resource fair helps equip families with a stock of supplies even if they already went school shopping earlier in the summer.\n\"At the start of the school year, you may have some school supplies,\" she said. \"But they need that care throughout the year as well. This is just to really get them started.\"\nOver 25 community organizations and partners set up tables inside Easton Middle's gymnasium to give out free supplies and resources. The Talbot County Free Library brought more than 400 cartons of colored pencils, while Eastpoint Church provided kids with drawstring bags filled with notebooks, markers and more.\nFor All Seasons CEO Beth Anne Dorman said the supply giveaway checks one thing off the list that can often make parents stress in the build-up to school. And it makes students more confident walking in on day one, she said.\n\"The child can walk in knowing that it's one thing that they're prepared for,\" Dorman said.\nIn addition to supplies, Dorman said For All Seasons assists children who are experiencing stress due to school starting up. This time of year, the organization sees an uptick in mental health requests from students, Dorman said.\n\"The transition is difficult, especially for kids who are new to a school or kids who are transitioning into one school or another,\" she said.\nEspecially for low-income children, the supply giveaway is a chance to build community, Dorman and Palmer both said.\n\"Children who don't have maybe what other kids have understand they're not alone,\" Dorman said.\n\"Folks identify it as a safe space,\" she said of the event. \"That's the beautiful thing about not only what we're doing with the school supplies, but having all of our partners in the community together.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "As students return, Chapel District Elementary begins next phase of renovations\n\n August 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 513\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CORDOVA \u2014 Renovations at Chapel District Elementary School are well underway as the school prepares to welcome students next week.This summer, construction teams completed the second phase of the project, which includes the school cafeteria and some classrooms. Talbot County Public Schools Director of Operations Kevin Shafer updated the Board of Education on the project at a work session on Monday.\n\"We did squeeze a lot of work into a very small amount of time, which was a bit risky,\" Shafer said. \"But the team has pulled it together, and things look fairly good.\"\nAs crews worked inside and around the building, teacher and staff moved in for the school year earlier this week.\n\"Staff returned today and it was very smooth according to (Principal Kari) Clow,\" Shafer said Monday.\nThe renovation is a multimillion-dollar effort that includes around $27 million in county funding as well as state funds from Maryland's Interagency Commission on School Construction. Construction is led by the Whiting-Turner Contracting Company.\nThe project is fully renovating the existing building, adding around 16,000 square feet. The Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers site located in the building was redone as part of phase one. Construction is expected to finish in 2026.\nChapel District Elementary is one of five elementary schools in the district. It was built in 1952 and last renovated in 1994.\nShafer acknowledged a few concessions had to be made in order for the school to welcome students back in time. Some hallway flooring hasn't been replaced, but he said it will still be safe in the meantime.\nThe school's gym won't be ready on the first day, either. It should reopen by the end of September, Shafer said. For now, PE will be held outside or in select classrooms.\nFurniture for the first two phases arrived on time, Shafer said. The district had to rework its furniture plan, placing orders this spring before tariffs took effect and drove up prices, Shafer told board members at previous meetings.\nFurniture for the third phase was ordered at the same time and is being kept in warehouses by the supplier at no cost to the district, Shafer said.\nDrivers passing the elementary school on Cordova Road will likely see significant construction work obstructing the front of the building. That's the third phase of construction, which includes renovations to the administrative offices and some classrooms. A new media center is also being added to the school.\nA temporary front office is located at the back of the building where the Critchlow Adkins Children's Center is located, according to a recent school newsletter. Parking will remain limited during construction.\n\"By the time students come next week, everything should be in good order,\" Shafer said on Monday.\nOn Thursday, Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi shouted out Chapel District Elementary administrators, teachers and staff.\n\"They are going to be teaching through the sounds of loud noises, construction, dust,\" Pepukayi said. \"They packed up their rooms at the end of the year. They just unpacked their rooms this year. And they are still managing to assemble classrooms to be ready for our students to walk through the door on Monday.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Pepukayi asked everyone to remember why they got into education \u2014 for the students.\n\"I want us to remember this feeling when we're happy, we have smiling faces, and we see our students,\" Pepukayi said. \"Because we all know what happens, the rollercoaster of education.\"\n\"It'll go up and down, it'll ebb and flow,\" she added. \"But remember your why.\"\nChildren return to the classroom on Monday for the first day of school. Before teachers get into the full swing, Pepukayi unveiled new district initiatives to staff.\nOne is what she called a \"community bus.\" Decked out with school logos, it will go around the community providing clothes, food and other needs to families, Pepukayi said.\nShe updated staff on two other items. The staff health center in Easton is under construction and expected to open sometimes this fall. District officials have had to overcome delayed construction work on the project this spring due to a federal reimbursement snag.\nMeanwhile, a new early learning center for kids up to 5 years old is in the works for White Marsh Elementary School in Trappe, Pepukayi said. This spring, Tilghman Elementary School opened its Judy Center, joining Easton and St. Michaels.\nGiovanni Wynn, family service coordinator at the St. Michaels site, delivered a speech on the importance of early learning and her excitement for White Marsh Elementary to join the district's other Judy Centers.\nWynn, the 2025-26 Talbot Support Staff of the Year, and Easton High School band director Lauren Rose, the Teacher of the Year, each were presented with new cars from Hertrich Chevy Buick GMC of Easton and General Manager Pat Papineau.\nOther awards were presented on Thursday, including the J. Sam Meek Unsung Hero Award. Pepukayi spoke on the impact of the two winners: Kristen Tilghman, former Blueprint implementation coordinator, and Michelle Ringgold, administrative assistant of curriculum.\nTilghman, now assistant principal at Easton High School, spent three years as the district's point person in carrying out The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's expansive education reform package.\n\"When I first came on board, the Blueprint was alive and kicking, and I had no idea what it was about,\" Pepukayi said. \"... She helped me tremendously in navigating through the Blueprint.\"\nRinggold has juggled a large budget, supporting field trips and arranging tutors to go to classrooms in her role at the Talbot County Education Center, Pepukayi said.\n\"When I walk in, no matter what day, no matter what challenge she's been through, there's always a smile on her face,\" Pepukayi said of Ringgold. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Students' devices must remain off and stored. Consequences will vary case by case, but violations may lead to confiscation and discipline, with severe penalties for recording or sharing inappropriate content.\n\"I recognized that there probably will be a learning curve for students and parents with this policy,\" board President Sheri Hubbard said during the Aug. 21 meeting.\nHubbard shared that during her time at the National School Board Convention, she attended a presentation from a high schooler who said not having her phone during lunch has made her class closer because they truly talk to one another now.\n\"And students, I just wanted to give you that little glimmer of hope, that all is not lost,\" Hubbard said. \"Your life will not end because your cell phone is in the locker.\"\nPeter Singleton, who has been working within Dorchester schools for 53 years, urged the board to vote in favor of the harsher policy. He said he's seen the negative effects of students being on their phone during class or walking down the hallway.\nWhen the board passed the policy, Singleton quietly said, \"Thank you, thank you, thank you, God.\"\nBoard members did not make this decision hastily. A majority of the members acknowledged the 115 comments they received from the public, wanting commenters to know their responses did not go unread or unheard.\n\"I want to make it clear, I read every single one of them. And I want that message out there to the public because there were a lot of people who responded with copies of their own research, and I've done a bunch of research as well as we've shared among the board, and I see the different perspectives on it, and I was really pleased to see, number one, that many people responded and two, with very real impact to them,\" board member Chris Wheedleton said.\nThe responses showed 38 responders were for the new policy, 59 said yes with some suggestions, and seven people opposed it, Wheedleton said. He said the remaining individuals had questions surrounding some of the policy's language, which Dorchester Assistant Superintendent Michael Collins said the board addressed in this iteration of the policy.\n\"They need to learn how we converse with each other,\" Singleton said after the meeting. \"That's what life's all about.\"\nThe new policy will be in effect for this upcoming school year, which starts Sept. 2. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "If we want reading success, we need to invest\n\n August 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TRISH BRENNAN-GAC | Section: Columns \n \n 518\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland is about to see how well we are addressing the reading crisis that has plagued our state since 2013 when NAEP test scores began a decadelong decline.Test scores are lagging indicators \u2014 by the time they drop, years of missed investments are already behind us. That means that the 2025 MCAP test scores, scheduled for release on Tuesday, are likely to reflect a mix of old decisions and new strategies but will not fully reflect the bold policies now on paper.\nThe central question is: Has our state done enough to expect dramatic improvement? Unfortunately, our answer is no.\nIn 2023, the state Board of Education took an important step forward by adopting a reading resolution and recruiting Carey Wright as state superintendent. Wright has worked with urgency to establish the frameworks and infrastructure needed for real change: creating a pre-K\u20133 Literacy Policy, revising standards, launching a process to update assessments and, most critically, building a statewide coaching model to help teachers transform instruction in line with the science of reading.\nBut policies without resources do not change outcomes.\nSince taking office less than two years ago, Wright has secured:\n$40 million over five years from the U.S. Department of Education$6.8 million from the IBIS Group for Science of Reading trainingOver $3 million in private funding for a statewide literacy coaching program\nThat is nearly $50 million in federal and private funds \u2014 a lifeline for Maryland's reading agenda. But these investments are time-limited and unsustainable. We need to sustain this early investment with a permanent dedicated state commitment.\nImplementation of the Pre-K Literacy Policy is beginning with clear expectations for how local education agencies should deliver literacy instruction and steps they must take to help struggling children. Teachers now have access to no cost training in the Science of Reading. But coaching is a necessary component to help teachers apply what they have learned so that our children receive the maximum benefits of their reading instruction.\nIf we want the kind of results Mississippi achieved, we need the kind of investments Mississippi made. When Wright led the Mississippi Department of Education, the legislature passed the Literacy-Based Promotion Act, which dedicated roughly $15 million annually \u2014 just 0.2% of the state's budget \u2014 to literacy coaching and support. That investment powered Mississippi's dramatic gains.\nBy contrast, in Maryland, Wright asked the General Assembly to fund a statewide coaching program. The Excellence in Schools Act authorized a school leadership training program that included \"a research-based model for coaching school leaders and 25 instructional coaches.\" Yet the Legislature appropriated zero dollars for implementation.\nMeanwhile, the only state program we can identify that directly supports reading \u2014 the funds for Targeted Support and Improvement \u2014 is expiring.\nThe message is clear: Maryland cannot coach its way out of this crisis on outside dollars. Federal and philanthropic grants cannot replace state commitment.\nIf Maryland is serious about a reading comeback, the state must do more than hire the right superintendent. Our legislature must invest real, sustained resources in literacy \u2014 just as Mississippi did.\nIt's time for the Maryland legislature to step up and fund a reading agenda worthy of our children's potential. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County students return to school\n\n August 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 414\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS \u2014 Students at the Talbot County's eight public schools returned to classrooms Monday, getting an earlier start compared to other districts that begin after the Labor Day weekend.In St. Michaels, a crossing guard stood on S. Talbot Street, directing drivers toward the St. Michaels Elementary School entrance. Car drop-off was relatively smooth, and all the buses arrived on time.\nSt. Michaels Elementary Principal Indra Bullock greeted families at the car drop-off starting at 7:30 a.m., while teachers showed kids the way to the front door. Some students walked in with smiles, while others were emotional for the first day.\nDan Schwartz dropped off his two kids, Henry and Eddie. Henry started kindergarten Monday, and Eddie started pre-K at the Critchlow Adkins Children's Center facility within the school building. The boys were excited for the upcoming school year, Schwartz said.\n\"I think they're just excited to meet new friends and get to know their teachers and the new school,\" Schwartz said. \"Eddie's excited to play, and Henry's just excited to learn.\"\nSchwartz, from Royal Oak, said his kids previously went to daycare in Cambridge. He's looking forward to their start at a new school.\n\"It's been a bit more of a schlep,\" he said of the commute to Cambridge. \"Now they're just excited to be going to school close to home.\"\n\"We're really, really happy to be in this school district,\" Schwartz added. \"We're excited, and have a lot of friends who had their kids in St. Michaels schools and have had a really good experience.\"\nON THE HORIZON\nTalbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said on Monday that the district's cell phone pouch policy will be implemented in the fall for St. Michaels Middle School students. The policy requires students to lock their phones in pouches during the school day in hopes that academic achievement and student engagement will both rise.\nThe pouch program was piloted last year at Easton Middle School. \"So far, so good,\" Pepukayi said of Easton Middle's cell phone rules.\nSt. Michaels Middle will begin to roll out expectations for the cell phone pouch policy before implementation around October, Pepukayi said.\nMeanwhile, teachers across the district will have a new policy to adhere to later this year: emergency lanyards. The lanyards will have buttons for staff to request help to their precise location during an emergency.\nThe superintendent said the lanyards, from the company Centegix, will also be a \"slow roll out.\"\n\"It's just one more layer, not just for students, but also staff,\" Pepukayi said earlier this summer. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "State test scores: Mid-Shore school districts see mixed results\n\n August 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Maryland Department of Education released English and math test scores Aug. 26, revealing a major jump for one Mid-Shore school district and mixed results for others.Test results from the 2024-2025 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program, or MCAP, show that statewide, students made slight gains in both subjects. English proficiency is at 50.8%, up from 48.4% the previous year. Math proficiency is at 26.5%, up from 24.1% last year.\nThe Mid-Shore's five counties \u2014 Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot \u2014 didn't always follow those state trends.\nIn English, Dorchester County outpaced all other counties in year-to-year gains. Dorchester's English proficiency saw the largest increase statewide \u2014 up 7.6% to a 41.3% proficiency rate, which ranks Dorchester 19th of 24 districts.\nDorchester Superintendent Jymil Thompson said in a press release that the improvement is a sign the district's work to climb the state rankings is paying off.\n\"These results show that belief leads to action \u2014 and action leads to results,\" Thompson said. \" ... Today, we can proudly say Dorchester is on the rise.\"\nCaroline tied for the fifth highest year-to-year improvement in English proficiency at 3.5%. The district's new English proficiency rate of 49% now ranks it 14th in the state.\nMeanwhile, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties were three of only four districts in Maryland with lower English proficiency rates than last year.\nQueen Anne's is still above the state average at 57% proficient, ranking ninth despite a 1.5% drop. Kent dropped 0.5% to 40.7% proficiency, ranking the district 20th statewide.\nTalbot is 16th in the state with a 45.4% proficiency rate after a 1.9% year-to-year decrease, the largest decrease in the state. In a statement, Talbot County Public Schools Director of Communications Debbie Gardner said the district is in the process of analyzing MCAP data and will make a presentation to the Board of Education in September.\nPROGRESS IN MATH\nAll 23 counties and Baltimore City are seeing progress in math. No district decreased in its math score from 2023-2024, and over a quarter of Maryland students are proficient in the subject.\nDorchester, again, saw the biggest hike of the Mid-Shore counties at 4.1%. The county is still just 20th statewide at 16.4% proficient. Kent follows at 21st with a 16.3% rate, up 3.7% from last year.\nKent County Superintendent Mary Boswell-McComas said in a statement that the district has worked on professionally developing school principals in math.\n\"We're seeing the payoff in how our principals coached teachers in developing students' mathematical reasoning and how our teachers incorporated that in their classrooms,\" the statement read.\nQueen Anne's remains the Mid-Shore county most proficient in math at 31.6%, a 2.9% hike from one year ago. The district ranks eighth in the state.\nCaroline jumped 2.5% to hit 22.2% proficiency, which ranks the district 15th.\nCaroline Superintendent Derek Simmons wrote in a statement that he's \"very encouraged\" to see the district's growth rate outpace the state's.\n\"Our sustained focus on what matters, and consistency around evidence-based approaches will continue our growth,\" Simmons wrote.\nTalbot math proficiency remained almost even, going up 0.6% to 18.9% this year. The district ranks 18th in proficiency. Only two other districts had year-to-year changes worse than Talbot.\nUP AND DOWN IN SCIENCE\nProficiency rates from the fifth and eighth grade science tests show Queen Anne's schools are well above the rest of the five Mid-Shore counties. In fifth grade, Queen Anne's is 10th of 24 districts with 29.3% proficiency, according to data on the Maryland Report Card.\nBut Talbot saw the state's second-highest yearly increase, climbing 5.9% to 22.8% and 15th overall.\nKent comes in at 16th in fifth grade science at 20.9%. Caroline is 18th with 19% and Dorchester is 20th with 17.4%.\nIn eighth grade science, Queen Anne's lost its first-place ranking from last year as other districts made significant jumps. But the county is still third in the state at 44.3%, down slightly from last year.\nCaroline's eighth graders were 16th in the state at 23.8%, a 4.5% jump. Dorchester increased by 4.6% to 19.9% proficiency, landing it at 18th.\nTalbot tied with Queen Anne's for the worst year-to-year change at -0.8%. It is ranked 19th now with 19.3% of eighth graders proficient on the science test.\nKent comes in at 16.8% proficiency, up from 13.4% last year.ENGLISH SCORES \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Students carry locked pouches during the entire school day, with their phones inside and not accessible.\nEach student has their own pouch, which travels with them daily from home to school. Phones are locked into the pouches at the beginning of the school day and unlocked at the end using a magnetic device. If a student leaves the pouch at home, they put their phone in the school office for the day.\nAccording to CCPS, year one of the pilot program was a success.\n\"We saw it was a good first year with it,\" said Caroline County Superintendent Derek Simmons.\n\"The recommendation ... the board accepted was to give it another year at our middle schools. One year does not mean a trend. We saw good good results, but we want to track it for another year before we make any determinations about if we were to move it forward to the high school level.\"\nThe cellphone pouches were created by the company Yondr and were tested in both Caroline County middle schools last school year.\nDuring the June Caroline County Board of Education meeting, district staff presented statistics for the school year. Compared to the year prior, CCPS saw 30.6% fewer referrals last school year, with 130 fewer attacks, threats or fights and about 200 fewer instances of disrespect and disruptions.\nAccording to Simmons, student and parents have been receptive of the cellphone pouches.\n\"Last year it was minimal resistance,\" Simmons said. \"You bring in something new, people are going to have some concern. They ask questions, administrators at the building level handle the questions really well. By and large, everything went well with compliance. It's funny, we've had hardly any asks this year going in the middle because it just has become the expectation.\"\nAfter one more school year at the middle school level, CCPS will revisit the topic and potentially incorporate the cellphone pouches to the high school level. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The competition is part of several events the Constitution Alliance will be hosting during Constitution Week, Sept. 14 to 20. Constitution and Citizenship Day itself falls on Sept.17.\n\"The events are especially meaningful this year as we celebrate the beginning of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence throughout Maryland and the United States,\" organizers said in a press release.\nCambridge-South Dorchester High School, Easton High School, The Gunston School, North Caroline High School, St. Michael's High School, and Saints Peter and Paul High School will each have teams of three students plus alternates. Competing teams will earn community recognition, and top performers will receive prizes and certificates.\n\"Not only will the event provide students with an engaging and spirited educational competition, it is a fun, meaningful way to fulfill the long-standing federal requirement that schools receiving federal funds must recognize Constitution Day during this timeframe,\" the release said.\nIn addition to the U.S. Constitution Scholastic Competition, the Mid-Shore Constitution Alliance will hold its annual Constitution and Citizenship Celebration event on Sept. 17 from 4:30 to 6 p.m. at the Academy Art Museum. The event features Frederick Douglass and Thomas Jefferson reenactors, in addition to local actors who will portray Tench Tilghman and Eastern Shore women who worked toward women's suffrage.

    "content": "Dorchester schools climb in state rankings after first year of ambitious reform plan\n\n August 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 509\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last year, Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson set out on a mission to change the school district's current ranking of 23rd out of 24 in the overall Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program evaluations. A year later, the results are in, and they look promising.The \"23, no more\" initiative is a three-year plan to move DCPS from the 23rd spot to 15th. Testing data released by the state this week shows the county has successfully moved up two spots overall, and it improved from 23rd to 19th in English Learning Arts proficiency.\nWhile DCPS' climb in the rankings may not be massive, district leaders say it shows notable progress.\n\"So we looked at the numbers as to what it would take for us to get to the middle of the pack, and we said, 'Okay, 15. If we move this amount of kids every year, we can at least get to 15. And then if we go higher than 15, that will be just added bonus,'\" Thompson said.\nThe superintendent said key strategies to get to 15 include setting a clear vision, conducting quarterly walkthroughs, focusing on instruction, rallying the team around a goal, supporting teachers, differentiating learning, simplifying processes and putting structures and systems in place.\nThe district's strategic plan, called \"Believe in Us,\" guides these efforts and emphasizes core values such as joy, putting children first and accountability. This plan has four key priorities: advance academics, optimize operations, pursue partnerships and cultivate conversations.\nFor Thompson, it is crucial that the community outside of the school system is involved in this process for it to work.\n\"I think that education is a community issue because I don't think there will be one person that would say that they don't want kids to be educated,\" Thompson said. \"That's the emphasis, that's the nucleus, right there. Everyone wants kids to be educated, so it's everyone's responsibility to ensure that the kids are being educated, not just the school system.\"\nThompson hopes the school system can act as a catalyst for countywide transformation through incremental progress and innovation.\nEfforts are underway to recruit more certified teachers and administrators to improve the attractiveness of Dorchester County Public Schools to parents and families in the area.\nThough these early results are promising, Thompson knows there will still be challenges to accomplish his ambitious goal. He said these do not deter him. \"There's no challenges that I don't think we can overcome as a district and community working collectively together that can be a hindrance for us to move to 15,\" he said.\nAs long as community members are willing to come up with creative solutions, Thompson firmly believes that there is no challenge they won't be able to overcome.\n\"We're not turning anybody away and we want everyone to be involved in the process because I think at the end of the three year journey, I think people will be happy about our progress as a school system,\" Thompson said. \"But I don't want them to be happy as innocent bystanders. I want them to be happy as active participants in the process.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Through these partnerships, the Judy Centers are able to provide a full range of early intervention and comprehensive services within the school and center.\"\nThe center offers multiple avenues of help and learning for Federalsburg residents ages 5 and younger.\n\"When we talk about working with those families and children, we offer play groups and our services always have a parent and a child component,\" said Heather Harding, Federalsburg Judy Center Early Learning Hub coordinator. \"It's always a family caregiver and the child together. So we offer play groups throughout the week, we offer family engagements, we offer parent training and that may take on different forms\u2026 We service the whole family so it's whatever the family determines their needs are, and it is a strength-based program.\"\nThe celebration of 25 years featured an event with activities for children and families. The Judy Center created a timeline walkthrough for the last 25 years and invited all previous employees from the 25 years to participate.\n\"It was really important for us that when we plan the celebration that we took it back to the focus of the Judy Center work, which is family,\" Elizabeth Saylor, supervisor of instruction, said.\n\"So, we did a big family event, so the kids had something fun to do, and the families had something fun to do, and then we did all those the traditional ceremonial things too\u2026We invited all previous employees to come back as well. So, it truly was as current families, family families, but then definitely our work family as well.\"\nStaff said the impact was the best reward for all the hard work.\n\"I absolutely love my job with the Judy Center, and I was here previously, when we also worked as an Early Head Start under the direction of Ms. Tearesa French,\" Harding said. \"She was the supervisor for 22 years of it. The impact that the work has made on everyone, it was never just one person. It's always been a collective. It's always been at the helm of Caroline County Public Schools, and just all the things that we were able to do to serve children and families has just been wonderful.\"\nTo learn more about the Judy Center, visit carolineschools.org/page/early-learning. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It represents people,. stories, traditions and dreams. And today, with the Guinean flag joining them, we are reminded that our school is not just an American institution but truly a global family.\"\nDramou urged the students in attendance to see the flags as \"more than fabric waving in the wind.\"\n\"I hope you see an invitation to learn from one another; to respect each other and to work together,\" he said. \"Here, in this academy, you are not just preparing for your own future.

FY27 shows the county allocating about $1.4 million, FY28 shows $8.1 million and FY29 shows $15.5 million.\nThese numbers are large, but Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said he expects the county allocation to be lowered over time because of state funding.\nSimmons said the numbers shown on the capital improvement plan for county allocations were determined based on what was needed to cover projected costs above what the state had allocated to the project.\nThe state and the county will then go back and forth on what the county actually needs based on research of student population and other factors. Simmons said the hope is that through this process, they will be able to get the county allocation amount down.\n\"We will spend the next several months, possibly a year, going back and forth justifying our ask and then them hopefully changing their stance and meeting somewhere in the middle,\" Simmons said. \"But what this represents is anything that we ask for above what the state is saying we need, it becomes 100% local cost.\"\nThe Board of Education approved the capital improvement program Sept. 2. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But since, the national trend shows girls declining in these areas at a faster rate than boys. Mid-Shore school districts were no exception.\nBut when Lily reached out to local districts to ask why this decline was happening and how they were responding, only one district responded.\nSo, after two weeks of pushing district representatives for answers, Lily switched her focus. She leaned into the numbers and contacted a statewide group focused on youth STEM programming to round out her story, which you can find below.\nThanks, as always, for reading.\n\u2014 Wendy Weitzel \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Girls lose gains in math and science post-pandemic\n\n September 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Headlines \n \n 894\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recent data from the Stanford Education Data Archive and the National Center for Education Statistics revealed that girls were making major gains in subjects like math and science before the pandemic. Since, the national trend shows girls declining in these areas at a faster rate than boys.Maryland experienced one of the largest drops in girls' math scores compared with boys'. Between 2019 and 2024, girls fell behind, on average, the equivalent of 49% of a grade level more than boys, according to data analysis from The Associated Press.\n\"There's a lot of cyclical things happening in education,\" Maryland's 4-H STEM specialist Mark DeMorra said. \"It's kind of like a pendulum in the fact that we swung so far to one side.\"\nGirls on Maryland's Eastern Shore were no exception to the decline in math skills. Talbot, Caroline and Dorchester County all followed this trend, but some districts stood out more than others.\nThe study compared 2023 National Assessment of Educational Progress test results to the 2019 national average. The results represented grade levels three through eight. A score of 5.5 is equivalent to the national average in 2019. Each whole point represents the equivalent of a grade level.\nIn Maryland, girls declined 0.92 points, almost an entire grade level, while boys dropped 0.47.\nPrior to the pandemic, girls throughout the country were outperforming boys in math and science on average. But AP's analysis found that in 2023, boys outperformed girls in nine out of every 10 school districts.\nThis was the case in Talbot County, where prior to the pandemic, girls were outperforming boys by 0.24 points. In the 2023-24 school year, boys outperformed girls by 0.17 points.\nBut girls still outperformed boys in two Mid-Shore districts. In Caroline County, girls scored a 4.51 in 2023-24 while boys scored a 4.44. In Dorchester County, girls scored a 3.14 while boys scored a 2.95.\nDorchester County saw the worst decline of the three counties, with girls dropping 1.05 points, while boys dropped 0.85 points. In Caroline County, girls declined by 1.18 points while boys dropped 0.81 points. Talbot County saw girls declining by 0.96 points and boys by 0.55.\nAccording to the Stanford Education Data Archive, no districts in Maryland have fully recovered their pre-2019 math levels.\nThe Star Democrat provided the data to local school districts two weeks ago. Talbot County Public Schools and Caroline County Public Schools did not respond to The Star Democrat's requests for comment. District representatives from those two districts requested specific questions, which were provided but not answered.\nDorchester County started at a lower baseline than the other two Mid-Shore counties, falling well below Maryland's state average. Comparing Dorchester County to the average found in the study, both boys and girls are roughly 2 to 2\u00bd grade levels behind in math.\nThe district's Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Student Services, Jodi Coleman, wrote in an email to The Star Democrat: \"While our girls' math scores dipped slightly more than boys' since the pandemic, the overall gap between genders is small. Both groups showed similar trends, and our overall performance has remained fairly consistent with pre-COVID results.\"\nDorchester County is working to make gains across the board with its \"23 no more\" initiative. The initiative aims to move Dorchester County Public Schools from 23 out of 23 counties in the state to 15th.\nOne year after the initiative was introduced, the county has successfully moved up two spots overall in the state rankings and improved from 23 to 19 in English learning arts and from 23 to 20 in math.\n\"The larger issue is that most of our students \u2014 girls and boys \u2014 are not yet proficient, which is why our 'Believe in Us: Advancing Our Potential Together' strategic plan focuses on improving achievement for all learners. Addressing any gender differences is embedded in that broader effort,\" Coleman wrote.\nDorchester schools are zeroing in on teacher training, small-group math support and expanded STEM opportunities, while also boosting dual enrollment and career pathways for female students. Coleman says these steps aim to close learning gaps and raise math and reading achievement.\nColeman wrote that Dorchester is seeing early signs of success.\n\"Preliminary benchmark data suggest stabilizing math scores for both genders. Schools reintroducing environmental literacy trips, small-group tutoring and STEM enrichment last spring noted increased engagement,\" Coleman wrote.\nGirls' enrollment in advanced math and science are returning to pre-2019 levels, according to Coleman. Some extracurricular programs, like robotics and coding clubs, are still rebuilding but trending upward.\nColeman wrote that opportunities were affected by in-person restrictions during the pandemic. Hands-on enrichment like robotics, STEM field trips and some environmental experiences were paused or scaled back. This was the case for many school districts.\nDeMorra, the 4-H STEM specialist, said framing math and science in an approachable and inclusive way is critical to engage students, particularly girls.\nThe core philosophy of 4-H is \"learning by doing.\" DeMorra said hands-on STEM activities help students, especially those who don't self-identify as \"STEM people,\" realize they are already using math and science through applied projects.\nMaryland 4-H partners with schools and community organizations to fill some of the hands-on learning gaps, DeMorra said. However, he said it is critical for all educators to work together.\n\"We all have the same basic goal. We should helping each other. And that's in general for 4-H too. We are trying to help each other and continue to do the best that we can for our children, our future,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Peter & Paul and The Gunston School in the small division.\nStudents from Easton and St. Michaels claimed victory in the hard-fought matches, tackling questions on the amendments, Congress, government-related vocabulary and more.\nIn a close race in the small division, St. Michaels erased a 10-point deficit by correctly answering the last prompt of the contest: a question on the 20th Amendment, also known as the Lame Duck Amendment, which moved term start dates for the president, vice president and members of Congress up to January.\n\"We just wanted to represent our school, prove that we were the best,\" senior Sebastian Cornish said.\nThe four St. Michaels students attributed their victory to James Kunz, their former AP Government teacher. They said taking his AP class two years ago prepared them for the competition. Some last-minute practice during lunch this year helped, too.\n\"He let us know about it briefly last year, and it came up again at the beginning of the school year, and we were like, 'We're all still down to do it,'\" senior Tyler Murphy said.\nKunz and other teachers, along with family and friends, watched from the crowd in what became an especially competitive environment inside the library's side room.\nStudents hovered their hands over the answer bell as questions were read aloud in a race to acquire as many points as possible. Wrong answers resulted in deductions.\nEaston High School's Constitution Bowl team took down North Caroline High School in Saturday's first match. By scoring the most points across both divisions, Easton High secured the grand prize, which included a plaque and a copy of the U.S. Constitution. Easton's four members signed the Constitution and will take it back to their school.\nThe event was hosted by the Mid-Shore Constitution Alliance \u2014 led by Richard Holman, Michelle Ewing and Julie Quick \u2014 in conjunction with the Colonel Tench Tilghman Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution. It capped off a string of events held during Constitution Week from Sept. 14 to 20.\nAfter the competition concluded, Wes Hagood, president of the Tench Tilghman chapter, thanked the students and families for attending.\n\"Participation today by all of our competitors really restores my faith in the youth of America,\" Hagood said.\nMembers of the winning St. Michaels team said they encourage younger students to participate in the future or learn more about the Constitution itself.\n\"Even if they don't really know about it, I'd encourage them to come watch,\" senior Brody McDaniel said. \"It teaches them a lot about government and the Constitution.\"\nMid-Shore U.S. Constitution Scholastic Competition results:\nLarge Division:\nFirst place, 415 points: Easton High School (Paige Bodle, Kadence McGuckin, Elmer Pineda and Lorelai Yacks).Second place, 350 points: North Caroline High School (Nicholas Jastram, Amanda Porter and Della Sefton).\nSmall Division:\nFirst place, 265 points: St. Michaels High School (Bo Asmussen, Sebastian Cornish, Tyler Murphy, Brody McDaniel).Second place, 250 points: Sts.

Parents and teachers clapped loudly when their kids scored and jeered at some bang-bang, judgment calls by the competition hosts, who maintained a fair and balanced scoring system.\nThe specific, quick-hitting questions gave students a shot to display their impressive memory of the U.S. Constitution and show some quick reflexes when attempting to ring in before their opponents.\nIn the end, teams from Easton High School and St. Michaels High School won in their respective divisions.

a pre-K program plan that is not feasible without Maryland Accreditation and EXCELS Level 4 status; financial assumptions that lack contingency planning for enrollment shortfalls, grant delays, or facility overruns; limited and underdeveloped plans for serving students with disabilities, English learners, and other student groups and an instructional program that remains underdeveloped and not adequately aligned with Maryland College and Career Ready Standards.\nThe committee acknowledged the charter school's group enthusiasm for the classical charter model, timely responsiveness in communication, and a strong commitment to the idea of school choice, Bell said.\n\"But the team also noted authorizing a charter school is not simply about approving an idea, it's about assuming full responsibility for students, staff, and the community under our umbrella,\" Bell said, a level of responsibility that requires readiness, compliance, and sustainability, \"none of which were determined to be sufficiently demonstrated within their application.\"\nFollowing the turbulent meeting Sept. 3 filled with heated discussions in the face of the application's proposed denial, the Queen Anne's County Classical Charter School group returned to the Board Sept 10. to present answer questions and allow for an in depth application review for the Board's decision.\nLead by a Board of Directors with expertise of former teachers and education professionals, the motivation to establish the classical charter school arose to provide options to parents and enhance the current system upon seeing current dropping proficiency rates, founder Audrey Scott said.\nCharter Committee Board of Directors President Ashley MacLeay noted that although seeking autonomy through waivers, the proposed classical charter school would ultimately be a public school part of the QACPS system that the Board of Education would oversee.\nStudent enrollment would be based on a lottery system.\nThe charter committee claimed it was not afforded opportunities for collaboration and was provided little assistance in certain application aspects, like identifying facilities.\nIf approved by the Board of Education, the charter school would continually seek collaboration with QACPS in establishing a charter agreement, as \"one holistic school system,\" she said.\nTo start, the charter school would need six teachers and has already received far more resumes than that of interested teachers, Scott said.\nThe group claimed interest has been overwhelmingly positive from the community including partners like the Giving the Edge Foundation and letters of support from the Queen Anne's County Commissioners.\nWhile not initiated yet, the committee received support from the county to direct mail to every county home to serve as a first general introduction to parents, Scott said.\nWhile letters of support have been received from the community overall, the QACPS Board of Education questioned student sustainability and a \"demonstration of need\" and claimed a lack of parent voices interested in enrolling students.\nCharter committee officials stated they have personally spoken to multiple families in full support of the program, just without time to write letters of support or a hesitancy to speak up at Board meetings.\nWith a potential program so monumental looming for the county, Board of Education member Mathew Drayer questioned how parents couldn't find the time to voice their support.\nA broad petition of county residents as well as outside of the county collected \"well over two hundred signatures,\" that included parents, MacLeay said.\nAlthough limited with polling data, the committee said it was happy to perform more surveys and was confident in the need.\nThe charter committee would ensure future marketing to all 8,000 students across the county's districts, Targeting families with elementary age children including homeschooled, the charter school would welcome reaching where families are, including libraries for an active presence and share what the potential school would entail, MacLeay said.\n\"We are trying to ensure we have viable schools with the right teachers and support and staff and everything they need to be successful,\" Board of Education President Shannon Bent said, and needed to hear from the community if there were additional needs to address.\nScott credited the above and beyond thoroughness forth by QACPS staff and Board of Education in reviewing the application.\n\"We are all in this for the children,\" Kibler said, and encouraged the committee to strengthen their application and resubmit next year.\nThe applicant retains the right to appeal to the Maryland State Board of Education or to resubmit during the next application window.\nThe QACPS Board of Education will next meet Oct 1. at 6 p.m. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Huester said their competitors for the funding told them they didn't receive the grant.\n\"I'm not really sure the practice of Office of Head Start not replying to anyone. We found out through a third party, direct competitor for funding actually. Maryland Family Network let us know what was going on,\" Huester said.\nHuester explained the funding was cut because of a decision to apply as a direct recipient instead of a subrecipient.\n\"We have over $1 million in funding. We applied for $3 million in funding, so essentially what we learned is if we continued as a subrecipient with Maryland Family Network, we probably would have had funding, it would have been no issue, but because we chose to apply as a direct recipient, we didn't receive funding,\" Huester said.\nThe decision to apply independently was made by the organization's board, but Huester said if MRCD knew that applying as a direct recipient would impacted its funding, MRDC would've made a different choice.\nHuester said that MRDC reached out to Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st), who sent a letter to the Office of Head Start. Harris said he has not received a response.\nAddressing concerns from residents about the program's end, Huester said MRDC has explored options to provide for the toddlers of Caroline County.\nThe options include introducing a Patty Center model, which aims to help the family as a whole, allowing parents to come on site for services like resume building and job searching while their children are looked after. There is also fee structure option, which consist of exploring what residents could afford to pay to keep a center open at spaces in Greensboro and Federalsburg.\nHuester also discussed converting existing Head Start spots and a collaboration with the Maryland State Department of Education for classroom models. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Math proficiency spiked year-to-year for fourth, sixth and seventh grades, but the number of students proficient algebra significantly fell.\nThe deeper dive came after the state released test score data for the 2024-2025 school year last month. While proficiency rates increased statewide, Talbot County students saw mixed results. English proficiency dropped to 45.4%, 16th in the state and the largest year-to-year decrease (1.9%) of all districts.\nIn math, 18.9% of students were proficient, 18th in the state and nearly even with the previous year's mark. Other counties, such as Dorchester, saw notable gains, rising spots in the statewide rankings.\nTwo days after the Sept. 15 work session, Talbot Board of Ed Member Deborah Bridges said at a monthly meeting that the district's results kept her up at night.\n\"After our work session on Monday night, I couldn't sleep,\" Bridges said. \"Our scores, it upset me so much. And I wondered, what are we missing? What is going on in our schools?\"\nBoard members largely agreed that the results aren't a matter of pointing fingers at teachers or staff. Instead, they are focused finding solutions to fix some of the problem areas.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said at the work session that she hopes school officials can begin to pinpoint some reasons behind the data trends.\n\"If I look at us, and we're going down, whereas a neighboring county who has a similar population of kids and they're going up, I want to know why,\" Jackson said.\nEinhorn said while the state tests are an \"important measure,\" it's one of many ways to assess academic achievement and growth.\n\"This is one assessment given at a single period of time, which does not always accurately reflect what students know and what they're able to do overall,\" Einhorn said.\nENGLISH\nFifth and tenth grades suffered the largest proficiency drops of 5.6% and 10%, respectively. But fourth grade proficiency rose to 50% in the most recent results. And while third grade proficiency dipped from last year's 47.9% mark, it's still at 43.6%, an improvement over a 35% rate two years ago.\n\"This really speaks to the work that this board has invested in early literacy, and starting to see that trend move up,\" Einhorn said at the work session.\nMeanwhile, most student groups followed the district's overall trend of slightly decreasing in English proficiency. Asian students fell from 68.9% to 51.2%, while Talbot's multilingual learners dropped from 8.7% to 5.1%.\nMATH\nOne of the sharpest drops came in Algebra II proficiency: 32.8% of students passed the state test in 2023-2024; only 7.1% passed in 2024-2025.\nEinhorn acknowledged that as an \"area of need.\" She noted that new math standards for K-8 will go into effect next school year. And in two years, the district will begin integrated algebra courses, infusing geometry concepts, she said.\nFourth grade rose nearly six percentage points to 32% proficiency this past year, while seventh grade had a similar hike from 11% to 17%.\nBy student group, one result stood out: Black students in the district remain under 5% proficient in math. Einhorn admitted the shortcoming.\n\"The less than 5% is indicating that we are still underserving our Black students and that we still need to continue looking at strategies that better prepare them to show what they know and are able to do in mathematics,\" Einhorn said.\nBoard Member Dyshekia Strawberry said she'd like to see the district work with community partners to specifically tackle the gap in math proficiency for Black students.\nBoard members thanked Einhorn for presenting the detailed trends, acknowledging that there's work to be done to get some of the numbers going in a positive direction.\n\"We have to do better, and we're open to hear how we're going to do that,\" Jackson said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland Supreme Court coming to Easton for first time since 1851\n\n October 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 480\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The Maryland Supreme Court is taking a field trip to Easton High School this week.The state's highest court is holding a special oral arguments hearing Friday morning inside the Easton High School auditorium, giving students a glimpse at how the Maryland Supreme Court operates.\nTwo cases, one civil and one criminal, will be heard beginning at 9:30 a.m. Friday. Both are open to the public.\nThe civil case deals with whether a court, when asked by an unlicensed landlord, can require tenants to pay rent. The criminal case is centered on whether police officers can initiate traffic stops for suspicion of cell phone use \"when they observe a driver manipulating a mobile phone,\" according to the case's online summary.\nFor each case, lawyers on both sides will have 30 minutes each to make their oral arguments, which build off of their written briefs to the court.\nStudents from local high schools and Chesapeake College are expected to attend.\nMaryland Supreme Court Justice Brynja Booth, of the 1st Appellate Judicial Circuit encompassing the Eastern Shore, said the special hearings are a way for the public to become involved in the judicial process.\n\"I really do believe that it's critical for the public's confidence in the judiciary,\" Booth said inside her Washington Street office on Tuesday.\nBooth acknowledged a recent \"erosion of public confidence,\" something she hopes can be quelled by the Maryland Supreme Court's off-site trips to places outside its Annapolis building.\nChief Justice Matthew Fader and six other justices, including Booth, comprise the Supreme Court. Formerly the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court usually hears cases after accepting a petition from a party regarding the Appellate Court of Maryland's decisions.\nBooth noted the Supreme Court's trip to Easton as historically significant. From 1805 to 1851, the then-Court of Appeals sat in Annapolis and Easton, Booth wrote. The court hasn't sat in Easton since 1851, she said.\nOff-site oral arguments are a relatively new endeavor for Maryland's most prestigious court. They're made possible through an administrative order, Booth said, which facilitates hearings at educational locations across the state. Arguments have been heard in Prince George's, Baltimore, Montgomery and St. Mary's County, she said.\nBooth and other Supreme Court of Maryland officials worked with Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi and Assistant Superintendent Helga Einhorn to coordinate Friday's event.\nOn Tuesday, Booth said she'd love to see students get involved in the judicial field, especially given what she sees as a lack of attorneys on the Eastern Shore.\nBooth, a longtime Easton-based attorney, said the Eastern Shore is a \"wonderful place to practice law and raise a family.\" She hopes Friday's special hearings will encourage students not only to explore law, but consider the Eastern Shore as a place to do so.\n\"You can be a little fish in the big pond, or you can come back to the Shore,\" Booth said. \"You can be a big fish in a little pond.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That changed Friday when hundreds of students and members of the public listened to oral arguments for two cases being heard by the Supreme Court inside the school's auditorium.\nThe special event is part of the Maryland Judiciary's effort to take off-site trips to educational institutions across the state. Students and school officials took notice.\nEaston High junior Lorelai Yacks knew it was an \"unprecedented\" opportunity. During a Q&A, Yacks asked the justices how their prior experiences led them to the Maryland Supreme Court as she considers a career in the adjacent political science field.\nMeanwhile, Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi couldn't have enjoyed the hearings more.\n\"The best thing for me is the real-world examples and experiences that our kids get,\" she said afterward. \"It's one thing to read about it in a textbook, to hear in a lecture from a teacher.

    "title": "A Day to Remember at the Library",
    "date": "2025-10-03",
    "author": "Bill Peak Talbot County Free Library",
    "content": "A day to remember at the library\n\n October 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 931\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n One hundred years ago, in October of 1925, Howard Carter reached Tutankhamun's burial chamber to find the pharaoh's features obscured by a mask of gold and lapis lazuli, Josephine Baker's La Revue N\u00e8gre premiered in Paris, and the War of the Stray Dog broke out between Greece and Bulgaria.A tad less dramatic perhaps, but so far as our lives go here on the Eastern Shore, surely the most consequential event of that long ago month took place on the 15th, when the Talbot County Free Library opened its doors for the first time.\nFrom the beginning, our library was a community undertaking. In 1922, a small group of Talbot County women, led by a retired professional children's librarian, Caroline Burnite Walker, began to host parties and seek pledges to raise funds for the effort. Eventually, 40 women pledged $50 apiece toward the project.\nThink about that. Forty women, now long gone, reached into their hearts and purses to endow an institution that still serves us 100 years later, an institution devoted to sharing knowledge with their fellow citizens and ours, regardless of station or rank, absolutely free of charge.\nWithin three years, the ladies had raised $4,149, the first librarian had been hired (salary: $900 a year), two rooms had been rented in the Tred Avon Building ($15 a month), and, on Oct. 15, 1925, the library opened its doors to the public for the first time. The collection size: 800 books. I would love to know what the most popular titles were.\nThe Talbot County Free Library will celebrate the 100th anniversary of that signal event on Thursday, Oct. 16, with a gala soir\u00e9e inspired by the decade that gave birth to it, the roaring '20s \u2014 flappers, \"The Great Gatsby,\" Prohibition and bootleg gin.\nThe evening will feature upscale hors d'oeuvres prepared by Royal Oak Catering, a specialty cocktail crafted by Lyon Rum, and wine and beer selected especially for the occasion by Wishing Well Liquors' renowned sommelier Philip Bernot.\nMusic for the night will be provided by the Julie Parsons Project Jazz Duo with Darrell Parsons. Among aficionados, Parsons is known for his phrasing and skill at bringing new meaning to the great jazz standards. He has performed on stages across the United States, Europe and Asia, appearing in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles jazz clubs as well as the opera houses and concert halls of Vienna, Milan, Paris and Seoul.\nPeople attending the event are asked to \"dress to impress\" in cocktail attire \u2014 which in my case means the usual white shirt, tie and blue blazer, but I'll bet a lot of folks will really put on the ritz. Josephine Baker would have a ball.\nTo purchase tickets for the gala, please go to tcfl.org/CentennialTicketsSponsorships/.\nAs if to showcase all that the library has achieved for our community over the course of its 100 years, a fair amount of the month's library programming will feature Talbot County history.\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 7, at 6 p.m., along with its community partners, the library will bring Carole Boston Weatherford and Jeffrey Boston Weatherford to the Todd Performing Arts Center at Chesapeake College to talk about this year's One Maryland One Book, \"Kin: Rooted in Hope.\"\nCombining remembered family stories with her gift for imagining, Weatherford has brought the lives of her Eastern Shore ancestors to life in verse. And her son, Jeffrey, has illustrated that verse with his luminous scratchboard art. In addition to being a Coretta Scott King Honor Book and this year's One Maryland One Book, \"Kin\" won the Boston Globe's Horn Book Poetry Award.\nAnd then, on Saturday, Oct. 25, at 11 a.m., as part of our community's celebration of Tench Tilghman Week, the library will sponsor a talk by professor Richard Bell in its Easton branch about one of our county's most important founding fathers.\nThe Tilghman family's internal conflicts during the Revolution presage those suffered by families during the Civil War. Tilghman was George Washington's most trusted aide-de-camp, while his father, James Tilghman, remained loyal to Great Britain and one of his brothers served in the British Navy. Add to that the fact Tilghman's uncle, Matthew Tilghman, would become known as the \"father of the revolution in Maryland,\" and you've got a recipe for some pretty calamitous family gatherings.\nFinally, I'm not sure it really qualifies as Talbot County history, and it won't take place until Dec. 1, but on that date, at 6 p.m. in the Easton library, the official launch of \"Adventures in Shelving, Vol. 2\" will take place \u2014 a collection of my favorite Star Democrat library columns published between June of 2015 and May of 2025.\nActually, now that I think about it, those two dates do bookend an interesting period in our nation's history. Several of the columns consider what our community went through during the pandemic, how we dealt with the limitations placed on our commerce and our social lives, and how, despite those limitations, we managed to reach out and help one another. And a few address the ever-widening political divide in our country at large, and how, once again, as a community, we have tried to rise above that division.\nBut most of the writing in the book simply celebrates our community library, its collection and the wonderful people who use that collection every day. I hope that, reading it, you will get to share some of the joy I have found in working for the library and serving the good people of Talbot County.\nSo please, if you can, join us at one or all of these events in celebration of the birth of our beloved Talbot County Free Library. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Priceless': Students watch Maryland Supreme Court hearings at Easton High\n\n October 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 837\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Instead of a play or concert, the Easton High School auditorium played host to something much different on Friday morning: the Maryland Supreme Court.Seven justices of the state's highest court, along with attorneys and court officials, took to the stage to dive into two separate court cases, one civil and one criminal.\nIt was a departure from their normal courthouse setting in Annapolis, and they did it in front of hundreds of local high school and college students \u2014 part of a new endeavor to periodically travel to educational institutions across the state.\n\"This was such a unique experience to be able to see the Maryland Supreme Court at my school,\" said Lorelai Yacks, an Easton High School junior.\nFriday was the first time the state's highest court sat in Easton since 1851, back when it was known as the Court of Appeals and regularly alternated between Annapolis and Easton.\nJustice Brynja Booth, of the 1st Appellate Judicial Circuit encompassing the Eastern Shore, spearheaded the effort to bring the court to Easton High alongside Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi and Assistant Superintendent Helga Einhorn.\nThe goal: expose students to the law field and allow them to interact with the justices through a question-and-answer session and sit-down lunch following the hearings.\nPepukayi beamed in an interview after the event about the rare opportunity students had just received.\n\"The best thing for me is the real-world examples and experiences that our kids get,\" she said. \"It's one thing to read about it in a textbook, to hear in a lecture from a teacher. To see it in action, priceless.\"\nThe court on Friday heard oral arguments for a criminal case involving whether police officers have reasonable suspicion to pull over drivers for touching or manipulating a cell phone while driving. The justices also heard arguments in a civil case dealing with whether a court can require tenants to pay rent when asked by an unlicensed landlord. Opinions from the court are expected at a later date.\nPepukayi said she think the cell phone case will resonate with students and members of the public who attended.\n\"I think the next time someone reaches for their cell phone while driving, if they were sitting in this room, they're gonna think twice,\" she said.\nYacks took interest in that case, in particular because the issue at hand of texting and driving was easily understandable. The professionalism and legal vocabulary used by attorneys on both sides of the case impressed her, she said.\nGoing in, Yacks said she knew the Maryland Supreme Court opening session at the high school was \"unprecedented.\" She left with a lot of useful insight as she considers pursuing a career in the law-adjacent political science field one day.\n\"It was awesome to see a similar example of what it might look like in the future,\" Yacks said.\nJustices give advice\nAfter the oral arguments concluded, students from Easton High, St. Michaels High, The Gunston School and Chesapeake College lined up behind two microphones to pick the brains of the seven justices on the Maryland Supreme Court for nearly an hour.\nQuestions ranged from asking about how Supreme Court hearings differed from trials, to how justices check their personal biases at the door, to what cases have stood out as the most interesting.\nJustices refrained from naming specific cases as their \"favorite,\" but Justice Stephen Gould said a worthwhile one is usually dependent on the attorneys involved.\n\"My favorite kind of a case is a case in which we have excellent lawyers before us,\" Gould said. \"Fortunately, because we get to pick our cases, for the most part, we virtually almost always get really, really good lawyers, and I think today was an example of that.\"\nGould emphasized that lawyers have their own styles and strategies, which were on display for students Friday. Each case had an attorney for the appellant, the side appealing a lower court's decision, and an attorney for the appellee, the side asking the Supreme Court to rule the opposing argument moot or back up the lower court's previous ruling.\nBut for all attorneys, Gould noted: \"They're prepared. They know their stuff.\"\nOne student asked the justices what common misconception they often encounter. Justice Angela Eaves said many don't realize that they aren't deciding cases based on personal feelings.\n\"We resolve based on the factual record and what the law says about it,\" Eaves said.\nThe justice for the 2nd Appellate Judicial Circuit (Baltimore and Harford counties) added that the court's job is more than just assessing the specific case before them.\n\"We're really looking at the broader implications of what the law should be with respect to the type of issues that come before us,\" Eaves said.\nJustices were asked to give advice to students that want to study law.\nChief Justice Matthew Fader emphasized that law isn't a narrow field, meaning people studying it should \"keep (their) learning broad.\" Attorneys are tasked with helping clients who come to them with real-life problems in a variety of areas, he added.\n\"Anything that happens in the world can end up in a piece of litigation,\" Fader said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The plan, required by the Interagency Committee on School Construction, aims to provide an effective learning environment, minimize disruptions, preserve school property value, maximize facility efficiency, and provide a foundation for risk management and preventive maintenance. The school system has 17 buildings, totaling nearly 960,000 square feet, valued at approximately $678 million. The construction cost per square foot for FY26 is $537, an 11.5% increase from last year. This increase is attributed to inflation and rising labor costs. Tariffs are a looming concern that may further impact costs. The board approved the maintenance plan.Robert Willoughby, director of administrative services, conducted the first reading of the Operation School Nutrition Programs Policy 9910. The policy is an update to a policy from the 1980s, changing the name from \"school lunch program\" to \"nutrition program\" to reflect the inclusion of breakfast. It also clarifies pricing for meals under the Community Eligibility Provision and for a la carte items.Willoughby presented the first reading of Policy 55080 on service animals. The policy aims to comply with ADA regulations and defines a service animal as an animal trained to perform a task for a person with a disability. It explicitly states that emotional support animals and therapy animals are not service animals. By law, service animals are typically dogs, with miniature horses considered under very specific circumstances for mobility issues. The policy outlines considerations for miniature horses, compliance with the law and the development of regulations for implementation.Superintendent Derek Simmons presented the Citizens' Advisory Committee nominees for 2025-2027. The committee is made up of parents and community members who provide feedback to the board. The committee was approved by the board.Kirk Howie, director of student services, provided an unofficial September enrollment update. The current unofficial enrollment is 5608, down about 40 students from last year, which is within the average 3% transition rate for Maryland. Elementary enrollment saw an increase of 53 students, while middle schools had a reduction of 51 and high schools a reduction of 61. Home school/instruction enrollment has increased, with 537 students this year, up from 466 in 2022-2023. \n\n ",

    "content": "'Bring people together': Radio station honoring Harriet Tubman launches in Mid-Shore\n\n October 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Dorchester \n \n 457\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 A new radio station honoring Harriet Tubman's legacy is coming to the Mid-Shore.WFHW 90.3 FM, a joint effort between WHCP 91.7 FM and the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center in Cambridge, will launch Sunday. Its call letters stand for \"Find Harriet Within.\"\nAmanda Tilghman, WHCP station manager, and Linda Harris, the museum's director, spearheaded the project, an over two-year effort.\nThey say the station will educate Mid-Shore residents about Harriet Tubman, the Dorchester County-born abolitionist who escaped slavery and helped others do the same using the Underground Railroad. Harris hopes to read books about Tubman on the air and tape interviews with people who participate in the museum's Underground Railroad walking tours through.\nWFHW will also act as a unifier, Tilghman and Harris said.\n\"There's so many divides right now,\" Tilghman said. \"And we want to just bring people together, and there's got to be a lot of conversation to do that, so that's what we're gonna do.\"\n\"Talk it out and play a little music in between,\" added Harris, who will act as WFHW station manager.\nThe Harriet Tubman Museum acquired a license from the FCC a while ago, Tilghman said, and transferred it over to WHCP. Recently, the WFHW tower was built off of Route 50 near Trappe. Antennas were placed earlier this week in advance on Sunday's launch party at the Avalon Theatre.\nThe new FM station will expand the reach of Radio Chesapeake, the entity made up of WHCP and now WFHW. Tilghman said WFHW will have a stronger signal toward the Bay Bridge, making it more accessible to residents on the western side of the Eastern Shore.\nHarris plans to host a five-day-a-week, hour-long talk show interviewing local figures. The interviews will dive into the journeys of people, sharing them with listeners and making connections to Tubman's journey.\n\"Everyone has a story and everyone's on a journey,\" Harris said.\nProgramming on WFHW will also include WHCP's two lead news programs as well as nationally syndicated shows.\nBuilding African American Minds, an Easton nonprofit dedicated to education and after-school programs for at-risk and minority youth, is a partner in the launch of WFHW. Kids in BAAM's programs will host their own shows, either in Radio Chesapeake's Easton studio or from a remote studio inside the BAAM facility.\nTilghman said it's been great to prep the kids to produce, host or DJ a radio show.\n\"The young people, we need that,\" Harris said.\nDiscussing the potential of WFHW to reach a new and diverse audience, Harris and Tilghman continued to come back the theme of bringing the community together.\n\"We gotta reel people in and show them it's all about love and community and compassion and empathy,\" Harris said. \"(That's) what we want to convey over the airwaves. We need that now more than ever.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Banned books once again increasing\n\n October 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 337\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n This week, Oct. 5-11, marks the 43rd year of celebrating the freedom to read with the American Library Association's Banned Book Week.It started in 1982, in response to a surge in book challenges and inspired by the landmark Supreme Court case, Island Trees School District v. Pico, which ruled that school officials cannot ban books solely based on their content (ala.org/advocacy). Now, decades later, we are experiencing a similar increase in censorship attempts across the country.\nIn their latest report, PEN America found that 6,870 books bans were enacted during the 2024-25 school year, across 23 states and 87 public school districts. And everywhere, more often than not, it is the books that have long fought for a place on the shelf that are being targeted: Books by authors of color, by LGBTQ+ authors and books by women. Books about racism, sexuality, gender and history also top the list.\nPublic library collections, too, are being attacked: the number of titles challenged in public libraries increased by 92% in 2023 alone. This increase is largely driven by organized groups and politicians, rather than isolated incidents, with groups demanding the censorship of multiple titles, sometimes dozens at a time (pen.org/book-bans).\nLibraries provide free access to information and resources that are vital to a functioning democracy. Banning books and censoring materials not only denies citizens their fundamental right to free speech but is a slippery slope to greater infringements and abuses of power, examples of which are in the news almost daily.\nIt's fitting that the theme for this year's Banned Books Week is \"Censorship is So 1984,\" as the world we are living in seems increasingly Orwellian. In the book we are warned, \"who controls the past, controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.\" Who will control our future? Who is controlling our present? Banned Books Week is the perfect time to reflect on these questions and take action against censorship in all its forms because, in a democratic society, free people read freely.\nMARY PELLICANO\nTalbot County Free Library Trustee\nEaston \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said that at times it can feel like a crystal ball is needed to determine whether a student poses an imminent threat.\nSuspensions can range anywhere from one to 44 days, Spurrier said. Any mark at 45 days or above is considered an expulsion.\nOut-of-school suspensions have been largely steady. Data presented by Spurrier showed there were 334, 355 and 344 such suspensions in school years 2022-2023, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025, respectively. This year, there have been 46 out-of-school suspensions so far.\nIn the same three-year span, TCPS had 60, 52 and 51 student arrests, and 12, 14 and 32 reportable offenses. Arrests are on school grounds either delivered by paper warrants or physical arrests, while reportable offenses occur off-school grounds and result in action by the school district.\nCompared to neighboring counties, Spurrier pointed out that TCPS has a relatively low rate of students suspended or expelled. In 2023-2024, 5% of Talbot students were suspended or expelled. Queen Anne's County came in at 3.1%, while Caroline (6.4%), Kent (7.1%), Dorchester (16.2%) and Somerset (17.4%) were all higher.\nBullying reports have hovered around the same mark in recent years: 72 in 2022-2023, 73 in 2023-2024 and 65 in 2024-2025.\nBoard President Emily Jackson asked if the district is encouraging students and families to fill out the bullying reports when appropriate.\n\"I know for a while there was both an understanding in the community and kind of a prevailing attitude of, don't fill out the report,\" Jackson said.\nSpurrier said the district never wants \"to discourage a family or a student\" from filling out the report paperwork. Jackson agreed.\n\"Even if it doubles our numbers, even if it looks bad,\" she said.\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi asked Spurrier if the state has certain red flags when assessing disciplinary data. For the most part, Spurrier said the state does not, though she noted the state does track if there is \"disproportionate disciplinary practices,\" especially for Black students and students with disabilities.\nThe student services director said the district is aware it needs to \"make sure that we are being equitable in how we're imposing discipline.\"\nBoard Member Ann O'Connor expressed some concern.\n\"Isn't it just a matter of who's breaking the rules and who's not?\" she said. O'Connor later added: \"I just hope we are not not disciplining students because it looks like we are disciplining more of the Black or underserved (students).\"\nJackson emphasized it's important for the district to consider its discipline interventions for underserved students and whether more funding should be allocated to those groups to proactively solve disciplinary issues.\nSpurrier said it comes down to making sure two different students in two different subgroups are receiving similar discipline.\n\"Are we responding differently to students who have the same offense?\" Spurrier said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

School nutrition specialist Kaitlin Fraer organized events at three different elementary schools in the county this October, which is National Farm to School Month. At the first station, guided by youth nutritionist specialist Beth Palumbo from the American Dairy Association, students learned about cows and fresh milk. Palumbo and her team were excited to share that milk \u2014 yes, even chocolate milk \u2014 can keep you hydrated after physical activities.\nChristine Allred, a former project leader and nutrition educator, and Deon Littles from the University of Maryland's College of Agriculture and Natural Resources showed the kids where their fruits and vegetables come from at the University of Maryland Extension station.\nAllred read a picture book called \"Up, Down, and Around\" and instructed the kids to stand up, sit down, and spin around as the seeds were planted.\nEach student received a plastic toy version of a fruit or vegetable to throw in the \"fruit salad\" \u2014 a colorful parachute that they raised in the air to mix the fruits and vegetables together.\nFarmers from Beagle Hill Farm, located near the elementary school, brought tractors to show the students while also teaching them about growing sweet potatoes.\nAdrian Hill and Greg Butterfield from Beagle Hill Farm assisted at the station.\n\"A lot of kids just don't have that connection of where their food comes from, or their clothing, or what agriculture can mean to them,\" said Butterfield, who has helped with the event for the last four years. \"Maybe we'll make the next generation of farmers because I feel like it is getting less and less every year.\"\nThe students were invited to plant sweet potatoes, pull fresh vegetables out of the dirt and use a planter to plant seeds.\nThe youngsters had a chance to meet farm animals, including horses, pigs, goats and bunnies.\nSt. Mary's Farm Bureau Ambassadors Susannah Wathen and Sam Wathen introduced the students to a horse named Willa, who the kids were intrigued to learn is blind in one eye.\nAfter moving through the stations, the students were served hamburgers and cheeseburgers with ground beef from Deere View Farm and Meats, Russell Bros LLC and Part Green Hill Farm.\n\"Living in a farming community, many people take advantage of the fact that they can get local produce most of the year, but it takes hard work to make that a reality,\" Fraer said.\nStudents will continue to engage with healthy eating thanks to curriculum provided by the University of Maryland Extension Program. The Food and Nutrition Services' dietitian is preparing marinated vegetables, roasted carrot fries and cheesy cauliflower for the students' lunches this month. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The $1.1 million contract was passed unanimously.\nShafer said some preliminary work will be done this spring before school ends. The school play and other concerts or events won't be impacted, Shafer said.\nOver in Cordova, the under-renovation Chapel District Elementary School will receive glazing for its new windows. The window glazing is a security film, Shafer said, a safety measure that \"prevents easy access to the school building.\"\nAll other schools in the district have the window glazing.\nChapel District Elementary is currently under renovation, a multimillion endeavor expected to be done sometime in 2026.\nThe contract is through a Maryland Center for School Safety grant in the amount of $132,000 for the window glazing. Shafer said the district couldn't move forward with it during construction of the renovated school building due to cost limits during the bidding process.\nShafer said he hopes the window security upgrades can be completed this summer. The board unanimously approved the contract.\nBoard President Emily Jackson added that she has \"slight hesitations about privacy\" as it relates to windows in classrooms and libraries at Chapel District Elementary and other schools.\nJackson asked that the board hear more about potential school safety grants in the future, particularly \"in the privacy arena to provide more screening for our students.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "This place impacts lives: Talbot County Free Library celebrates 100th birthday\n\n October 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 798\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Two books missing from the shelves of the Talbot County Free Library for 50 years were finally returned to their home on Thursday.Johnny Mautz, the state senator and St. Michaels resident and businessman, fondly remembered using the library as a child, getting shushed as he walked into what was a much smaller space than it is today.\nMautz called the library \"an anchor\" of the community, thanking the staff and volunteers for their dedication to growing the library as it celebrated 100 years on Thursday evening.\nBut before he could finish his praises, Mautz had two special surprises for library staff. \"The Ugly Duckling,\" last checked out June 7, 1975; and \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier,\" last checked out Aug. 26, 1975.\n\"Johnny Mautz, you are in trouble,\" the senator joked.\nMautz's return of the children's books was just one of many moments where community leaders and residents smiled and chuckled on Thursday during the Talbot County Free Library's centennial celebration.\nBoard of Trustees President Susan Sherman blew out the candles on the 100th birthday cake. Dana Newman, the library's director, said the century mark wouldn't be possible without Caroline Burnite Walker, the founder of the library in 1925.\nIn its first year, the library paid $15 monthly rent to use two rooms at the Avon Realty Building on South Washington Street in Easton. Now, the library is a full-fledged community hub, stocked full with books, computers and research rooms, offering residents access to the internet, community events, children's festivals, wellness services and much more.\nTalbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher remembers his son biking to the library at 9 years old. One of his son's proudest moments was getting a library card.\nLesher, chief historian at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, reflected on the how the library has guided his research projects and skills.\n\"Are you a better person, are you a better version of yourself because of the library?\" Lesher asked a crowd of over 100 people at Thursday's gala.\nIn unison, they clapped and exclaimed, \"Yes!\"\n\"I know that I am,\" Lesher continued. \"And I know that thousands of people in this county alone are, as well. There are something like 200 people here this evening. Multiply that number by 100, and you're looking at roughly the number of cardholders for this library. There may be more cardholders for this library than there are licensed drivers in Talbot County.\"\nHe added: \"It will continue to serve the next generation of children up to our citizens who are over 100, all of whom use this library. Rich and poor, all ages. This place impacts lives and must continue to do so.\"\nLocal authors gathered to reflect on how the library helped their journeys. Tim Young, founder of the Chesapeake Children's Book Festival, recalled how the library allowed him to bring esteemed children's authors to Talbot County for a festival now running on 10 years.\nCarole Boston Weatherford, an author and former professor, said the Talbot County Free Library was her go-to place for borrowing DVDs, grading papers, internet access and research.\nShe used the library's expansive Maryland Room for \"Kin: Rooted in Hope,\" a 2023 book reimagining the lives of her ancestors, who were slaves in Talbot County.\n\"This library is very close to my heart,\" Weatherford said.\nWhile the library's main branch is in Easton, a St. Michaels branch provides key access for residents in many other parts of the county. The St. Michaels location is currently undergoing renovations to expand and add more children's spaces, a project that will be finished in early 2026.\nNewman, the library's director, thanked county officials for their continued financial support that has made the St. Michaels expansion possible.\nState officials shared heartfelt words for the library and its leaders during Thursday's centennial gala.\nIn a video message, Comptroller Brooke Lierman said the library is so critical as a place for people to apply for jobs or file tax returns, among many other uses.\n\"Consider the child who became a reader here, the entrepreneur who built their business plan at your computers, the senior who found community in your programs, and the immigrant who learned English,\" Lierman said.\nJoy Moore, the mother of Gov. Wes Moore, attended the gala and read her son's citation to the Talbot County Free Library aloud.\nMaryland State Librarian Morgan Miller, acknowledged the Talbot library as an inspiration to other rural libraries on the Eastern Shore. Miller, former director of the Cecil County library, said Talbot's children's book festival inspired her to implement a similar program up in Cecil.\n\"When I think about all of the stories in this library \u2014 and not just on our shelves \u2014 we're looking at 100 years,\" Miller said. \"The stories of generations, and the generational impact of libraries, that just can't be captured in a night. But it is captured so well in your community here every day.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

On this particular afternoon, the children were making Halloween decorations and doing arts and crafts.The Cambridge Empowerment Center is a non-profit located on historic Pine Street, offers after school, summer learning and pre-school programs, hosts food drives, clothing drives, food distributions, senior health and enrichment programs, learning seminars and more.\nDirector of Children's Programs Tammy Washington oversees programs from pre-kindergarden through 13 years old. The pre-K program is free and runs from 9 a.m. to noon. Washington said there are slots available for this program. Those interested may sign up on the website.\nThe after-school programming runs from 3-6 p.m. with themed days including math, art and IXL, a subscription-based learning site. In addition to the educational programming, the children get a meal and a snack after school.\nThe summer program costs $125 for six weeks and offers breakfast and lunch, field trips, education and a tennis program and an additional cost with licensed child care providers.\nOne of the third grade children who attends the after-school program said she loves coming to the center and enjoys multiplication, reading, painting and learning about Harriet Tubman. Her favorite book is \"Llama Llama Mad at Mama.\"\nThe center opened in 2003 and has been licensed for child care for two years. Previous to the pandemic, the empowerment center solely operated through donations and via volunteers. Now, it runs on grant funding in addition to donations. Staff are paid and certified to work with children though they still welcome volunteers.\n\"After the pandemic, we started all over again,\" board member Julia Barker said. \"We had to reinvent ourselves.\"\nThe center is hosting an open house on Nov. 9 for community members to check out this reinvention. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

All of our neighboring county fair facilities are all owned by county governments. So we have a lot of things to worry about. We have to worry about facility maintenance, repairs, operations.\"\nAs co-chair of Ag Center's fair committee, Clougherty says that the fair has maintained that unique distinction.\n\"We know who we are,\" she said. \"We're a small, old-time, family-fun outing.\"\nWhile the center is hosting its 41st county fair this week, it serves the community year-round, not just during fair weekend. It hosts events such as weddings, birthday parties, meetings and workshops.\nWith no full-time paid staff members, the Ag Center relies on volunteers through community organizations. It makes for a truly unique and personable experience during any event, Clougherty said.\n\"It's a labor of love and service,\" she said.\nNEW PARTNERSHIPSClougherty says the Ag Center is always open to new relationships throughout the county. For instance, the Rotary Club of Easton recently held its first event at the center to initiate new officers.\nAnother new partnership is coming this fall, as four soccer fields at the property will house Chapel District Sports' first year of soccer practices and games while Chapel District Elementary School is under construction.\n\"I just think it's a really good way to expose people to what we do here and build that community connectedness,\" Clougherty said.\nShe believes that partnership and similar ones will allow \"kids and families to come together.\" She also mentioned an \"ag-accurate book trail\" will be on the grounds of the center by this fall, which will feature readings and activities at multiple stations.\nIMPROVEMENTSAs the Ag Center grows in its community reach, so has the need for facility improvements. Clougherty pinpointed recent upgrades, including up-to-date electric and a new sound system.\nFacility improvements would be completely different without assistance from Maryland 4-H youth, Clougherty said. Through Maryland 4-H's Diamond Clover Award Program, which requires service hours, local youth have transformed the Ag Center.\nShe said 4-H members have been responsible for rebuilding the outdoor stage, barns, installing fans in the buildings and making benches and the sidewalk accessible.\n\"We wouldn't be as far as we are today if it hadn't been for several outstanding youth throughout the years,\" Clougherty said.\nIt's just one example of how the community gives back to the Ag Center that has long served county residents, particularly youth.\n\"It's a special gold star for the kids who see the need and work hard to contribute,\" Clougherty said. \"Because they know they've benefitted from being out here.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Best in show: 4-H kids work hard to raise, ready animals for fair\n\n July 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lilly Howard Special to the Whig | Section: News \n \n 747\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FAIR HILL \u2014 In the months leading up to the Cecil County Fair, 4-H members can be found working hard, raising and training their animals to get them ready for the fair.At the fair, the animals are one of the main attractions, housed in the fairgrounds' barns in between the various competitions and showings that take place throughout fair week.\nTails and Trails 4-H club worked together this year to try something new: raising and showing 100 meat chickens.\n\"They eat and drink a whole lot more than you would ever imagine at this point. We bought a bag of feed yesterday and we are almost out of it,\" 4-H member Katilyn Carter said.\nCarter, 16, is showing meat goats, meat chickens, and doing herdsmen with her pony. Herdsmen entails keeping your animal at the fair all week, ensuring they are fed, watered, healthy and clean, with a corresponding informational board to educate the public and judges about your animal.\nTo prepare her meat chickens, Carter washes them two to three days before the show to ensure they have a natural oily shine. This paid off, as her chickens won first and second place ribbons at the fair over the weekend.\n\"It's going to sound really funny, but you actually blow dry them. You want them to be really fluffy\u2026You just want them to look like little chunk balls of fluff and meat,\" said Carter about preparing her chickens for show day.\nIn showmanship competitions, you must be very knowledgeable about your animal in order to show the judges that you put in the work to be successful, according to Carter. The 4-H member must present their animal to the best of their ability, demonstrating cleanliness and knowledge on what they eat, their parts, their breed and more, said former 4-H member and long-time judge Carolyn Lawrence.\nFor meat goats, who are bred and raised to become a meal on someone's plate, the 4-H members start working with them once they are born in January or March. A few weeks later, once they're weaned from their mothers they start training them to walk with a halter and lead line, taking them on mile long walks several times a week, according to Libby Kondracki, Tails and Trails leader.\nWhen it comes to show day at the fair, Carter washes her goat in the morning and covers him to ensure he stays clean white. Since they're raised for meat, she then blow dries the animals to get them looking as fluffy as possible. According to county fair regulations, no baby powder, artificial coloring, or adhesives like hairspray can be used on the animals.\n\"The power in fitting your animal, and knowing how to fit your animal and showing your animal to make it to where you know you're showing this animal the best you can to its fullest potential. You really have to work with your goat,\" Carter said.\nBefore the fair, members get together at least twice a week and meet up as a show team and prepare together. Many of the 4-H parent leaders were 4-H members themselves when they were growing up. And many current members plan to stay involved after they age out at 18 years old to continue to give back to the community that helped shape them.\n\"I really love teaching them,\" said Carter about helping teach younger 4-H'ers. \"Because they're going to be, you know, when I'm done in two more years, they're going to be the ones that are taking over. So you really want them to be the mentor you kids that you were to them.\"\nAlthough many 4-H members compete against each other at the Cecil County Fair, they are all a team at the end of the day.\n\"When one wins, we all win,\" said Carter.\nIn addition to the camaraderie 4-H supplies, it also helps educate the public about the livestock they often consume.\nThanks to being involved in the Rising Sun 4-H Club for the past four years, Mason Gentry enjoys educating the public about his animals and their purposes. For example, he explained the importance of knowing that a Heifer is a female cow who has not been bred yet, a cow is a female cow who has been bred and had a calf, and a Steer is a male cow that's been castrated and is meant for beef.\n\"The goal of the fair is to educate the public about agriculture, give them an opportunity to see where the food comes from,\" said Mark Barczewki, 4-H Barn Stompers club leader. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Giving to the community \u2014 teaching the next generation\n\n August 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 937\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Henry and Beth Covington have a long history in Queen Anne's County. Both of their families arrived in the United States in the 1700's. Eventually, the Covingtons' settled in Queen Anne's County. Beth's ancestors landed on the Eastern Shore of Virginia and migrated to Mississippi.Henry's great-grandfather, also called Henry, was a Methodist minister at three local churches, Burrisville, Starr, and Salem near Church Hill. His son (Henry's grandfather), Edward, was a preacher and tenant farmer. Henry's dad, Henry Sr., preached for a while, but then began a career with New York Life Insurance.\nIn 1979, Henry Sr. and his wife Kathryn, bought the Peace and Plenty Farm from the Wright family and started farming. Henry Sr. always said there were two things his father approved of during the year other than work and going to church; attending the 4-H fair and riding to Rehoboth Beach for the day! To get there, all nine kids piled in the back of a 6-wheel truck filled with straw! Henry's mother, Kathryn, was raised on the Richard family farm near Templeville, along with her 12 siblings.\nBeth was born in Mississippi where her maternal grandparents, the Dilworths, farmed. She moved to Kent Island at the age of 4, when her dad began working for Maryland DNR. Beth's family also had their faith, it was a big part of growing up and they attended church regularly. After graduating from Chesapeake College, Beth attended the University of Maryland Dental School, earning her degree in dental hygiene.\nHenry graduated from the University of Delaware with a degree in Plant Science. Spring of his junior year, he attended a semester at Chesapeake College and met Beth. Henry was recruited by some high school friends at Chesapeake to play baseball. At one baseball practice, Henry noticed one of the softball players. She was wearing red shorts and Henry asked one of his teammates \"who is that girl in the red shorts?\". Henry was told it was Beth, his friend Earl's little sister. Beth mentioned \"since she was a couple years younger than her brother, no one noticed her until college!\". After the chance meeting at baseball and softball practice, they dated and were married in 1982.\nIn 1980, Henry started working at Agrico and Crop Production Services, selling fertilizer and Pioneer seed. Henry had his first opportunity to rent a farm on his own from Gladys Cahall. His grandmother was Cahall's Sunday school teacher so she knew Henry's family very well.\nHenry enjoyed farming with his dad for many years. After 10 years, Henry became a full time Pioneer sales rep while also farming over 1300 acres. Henry and Beth dreamed of owning their own farm, and in 2001 that dream came true. They bought a farm near Centreville, and named it Broadland. After 30 years, Henry retired from the seed business in 2021. A good friend, Anton Roe now continues the business as a local Pioneer sales rep. Henry and Beth continue to farm.\nHenry and Beth have three children; Will, Ben, and Sarah. Will graduated from Washington and Lee University and is now working as a systems engineer for Communications Electronics Systems Integrated. Ben graduated from Iowa State University. He works for the University and John Deere as an agricultural and biosystems engineer. Sarah graduated from the University of Richmond with a degree in Biology. Sarah teaches biology at Queen Anne's County High School.\nBeth had worked off the farm as a part-time dental hygienist for 38 years. This allowed her to take care of the kids and help on the farm. Their three kids were actively involved in 4-H, showing pigs, steers, and rabbits, and entering indoor exhibits. Henry was recruited by Paul Gunther to help with the open farm crops at the fair and to assist the Godfreys with open vegetables. Henry and Beth gladly did this for over 30 years.\nAfter the kids had all left home and Beth retired as a dental hygienist, she had time to work on one of her hobbies, quilting. She said, \"My grandmother sewed and taught me to sew. I started out making doll clothes and then made clothes for myself, and later, my kids. After the kids left home, I started to quilt\". Beth has been generous in her quilting talents, giving quilts as gifts and donating them to people in need.\nAbout the same time Henry started collecting old tractors. His first was a 1958 John Deere 730. The 730 was one of his favorite childhood toys and 1958 was the year in which he was born. At some point Beth mentioned she would like to have a Farmall cub, like the one she remembered Mr. Ernest Porter owning. Henry found a 1960 cub right away (the same year she was born!) Mr. Ernest Porter was a wonderful Christian man who was very dear to both Henry and Beth. Mr. Ernest Porter was a big influence in Henry's life. \"He never seemed to get upset\" Henry said. He was also a faithful member of Beth's church on Kent Island.\nHenry and Beth consider themselves so very blessed to have had all the experiences that come with living in our farming community. They have thoroughly enjoyed supporting and serving others through their church, 4-H, and school activities. Henry said with a smile \"people are generally good and giving back to your community keeps our community close\". He said \"my father never missed a 4-H Fair up until his passing and I feel the same way. The fair is a good way to stay involved and see people\u2026Everyone should give some of their time to their community. That's how we teach the next generation.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

For older kids, there was a mechanical bull.\nThe Reger Pavilion had live music. Everything from the old-timey country sound of the Jone's Brothers to the foot stomping Amish Outlaws and '80s-inflected The Reagan Years.\nThere were lots of competitions to show younger community members' efforts to raise dairy cows, goats, swines, horses, rabbits and beef.\nJody Neal, Caroline County FFA Advisor and ag teacher at Caroline Career and Technology Center had lots of students participating in fair contests.\n\"I have nine kids showing animals today. I have kids showing sheep, swine, market goats and breed goats,\" Neal said.\nThe students raise their animals for a year leading up to the fair. After all that effort, the animals ended up at the livestock auction on Saturday night. This sale funds the students' project for next year. The pork can go back into the school system and is served in the lunch line.\nSkyler Blunt, a participant in the swine competition, said it was rewarding to show a year's worth of work.\n\"I have two Hereford barrows and one Yorkshire gilt,\" Blunt said. \"The best part is the accomplishment that the fair brings you and getting to show people your project for the year.\"\nEmma Boyle, 18, who had just graduated from high school, said, \"I am showing two crossbred pigs. I have been doing this since I was five. I love it. This is my last year. My pigs are named Buzz and Woody.\"\nBarbara Carrow, who was announcing the swine show, is co-leader of Pure Country 4-H Club. She has 62 kids in her Caroline County chapter. They showed at least 50 swine at the contest.\n\"I love working with young people, and I love animals. It teaches them responsibility and how to interact with adults other people. It gives them confidence,\" Carrow said.\nWandering in the crowd was a princess \u2014 the Dairy Princess.\nCaroline Kimball of Queen Anne's County High School wears a sash and a tiara.\n\"I am the Eastern Shore Dairy Princess because I represent the dairy industry. I like educating people about the dairy industry. You can add a dairy product to all three meals of the day. I like chocolate milk after practice. I want to major in animal science,\" Kimball said.\nThe judge, Gabe Zepp of Carroll County, picked first, second and third place winners. With every participant, win or lose, he offered instruction on how to improve.\n\"I want to see these hogs with their heads up at all times. Head placement. I want to see that they are comfortable with a whip. Nice and in control of the hog,\" Zepp said.\nNavonne Owen, 4-H Educator for Caroline County, said, \"They have all worked so hard on their projects and this is the time to shine. They are all doing an excellent job. They are resilient and flexible and they are learning so many life skills from the project. It will help them in the future.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

As owner of Green's Septic, he and his employee of six years Pete Padley enjoy educating kids on the vehicles each year.\nOther than the big trucks, local and state emergency personnel were on site giving demonstrations.\nChief Logan Quinn from the Kent County Office of Emergency Services had lifesaving items on display: cardiac heart equipment, CPR devices and a pediatric response bag.\nChestertown Police Chief Ron Dixon presented some everyday tools they use to assist the public: bolt cutters, pry bars and jumper cables.\n\"When people see these items, we hope they see we're there for the community,\" Dixon said.\nWith a generous crowd scattered throughout the large grounds, it was calm, a good environment to learn, talking to equipment operators.\nThat calm was momentarily shattered at around 11:30 a.m. when a helicopter from the Maryland State Police was spotted hovering over the grounds. As soon as the chopper touched grass, kids and adults made a beeline to it, excited to get a tour.\n\"It's an impressive bird,\" said airline pilot of 25 years John Strigle. As a civilian volunteer he had a wealth of knowledge he shared along with the state police operators.\nThey answered questions, letting kids sit in the Agusta Westland AW139, creating lots of memories and providing parents with photo opportunities.\nOther than vehicles, the various Kent County 4-H clubs manned stations running activities for the public to enjoy. The Kent Fuzzy Tails & Shiny Scales group allowed a chance to pet the rabbits, talk to their owners and participate in a prize-winning activity.\nPrincipal Agent Associate, 4-H Youth Development Kent County, Beth Hill, behind an inventive bike/blender making pumpkin smoothies, said these kinds of events help generate new members.\nIn addition kids participated in a hay bale toss and Tic Tac Toe with pumpkins, while Matt Jones gave hayrides and various organizations like Rock Hall Dental fielded questions at tables.\nCo-organizer Cindy Moore said Touch-a-truck came about to show appreciation to the 4-H clubs who maintained the place year-round.\nShe thanked everyone for showing up that day.\n\"We all work together on this,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Following the land sale from the church, the garden had to look for a new home and McKnight reached out to the County Commissioners over the summer for assistance.\nFormed in 2015 as the Galilee Community Garden, the Kent Island Community Garden serves the need for a community garden in the Harbor View area of Chester and has since blossomed to include church volunteers, local Master Gardeners, Boy Scout Troop 495 and neighbors of all sorts ready to get their thumbs green.\nThe community garden also partners with the University of Maryland Extension Master Gardeners Program for educational opportunities.\nThe garden offers many beds of vegetables, flowers, and a separate herb garden with an irrigation system and compost area.\nThe Maryland Food Bank cites that one in three Marylanders face hunger. \"With several of our gardeners in independent living facilities and one handicapped gardener, we realize how critical it is to establish a new space for our community garden,\" McKnight said.\nVoicing their appreciation for the garden, the county Commissioners approved a $1,500 grant to help the garden blossom at its new location.\nThe new location's property next to the offices of the Fire Marshal is an ideal location to offer sufficient land for growth along with the necessary utilities as well as close proximity to the Cross-Island Trail, local schools, and the public library.\n\"It's going to be a great resource for the county,\" McKnight said.\nThe Kent Island Community Garden is always looking for new gardeners and civic minded groups to help build garden beds, according to McKnight.\nThe all inclusive garden stakes claim in having the only handicapped-accessible garden beds in the county, he said.\n\"We are a diverse and unique group of twenty gardeners and are the only community garden in Queen Anne's County that is open to all, \" McKnight said.\nLooking ahead, the garden hopes to build a few garden beds before winter sets in and In the spring seeks funds to install a deer fence around the perimeter, he said.\nMore information about Kent Island Community Garden can be found by contacting McKnight at McKnightJohn143@gmail.com or 202-257-3754. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) spoke to the state legislators on his excitement for the Trump administration that was sworn in on Monday and the changes that will be made to government spending now that Tesla CEO Elon Musk will co-lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.\n\"I do believe that we have to operate more, and the federal government has to operate more like the private sector does,\" Harris said. \"...Elon Musk is going to do in terms of promoting government efficiency because in the end we cannot continue trillion dollar deficits into the future. We have to control federal spending. We are cursed with without a balanced budget amendment.\"\nSeveral Republican delegation members at the meeting echoed these sentiments.\nMany spoke on the state of Maryland and the amount of federal employees it has, some saying the state is too heavily dependent on federal employment.\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said recent actions of some state officials in response to actions taken by the Trump administration do not align with Maryland's needs. He said the state is \"trying to find $3 billion\" and yet is involved in lawsuits against the federal government.\n\"The (Maryland) attorney general seems to have plenty of money to want to sue the federal government,\" Hutchinson said. \"Well, at the same time, the state has their hand out to the federal government saying, 'I need money for the Key Bridge. I need more Medicaid money.'\"\nPRIORITIES FOR FARMERSThroughout the meeting, several representatives and supporters of farmers and agriculture policy spoke, including Tyler Hough, director of government relations for the Maryland Farm Bureau, who shared priorities for the organization for the next fiscal year.\nHough said the bureau has three policy priorities, including private property rights and eminent domain, solar energy, and agriculture education. In his presentation, he focused on the importance of education for the state.\n\"The opportunity to educate the youth, even get into the middle school areas, the opportunity to have education in the high schools and the FFA (agriculture education) programs and the value that FFA brings along with the 4-H programs that already exist, is just fantastic for these students,\" Hough said.\nLater on the agenda, a presentation was made by members of the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology, an organization centering scientific research, policy analysis and outreach and education efforts.\nKate Everts, executive director of the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology, led the in-depth presentation, in which she highlighted the Maryland Climate-Smart Agriculture Project and the extensive outreach to Eastern Shore farmers that the center has done.\nEverts said the farm-centered project seeks to find what agriculture needs to be adaptable and profitable for a future dictated by climate change.\n\"We're seeing changes in weather across the country, but here in Maryland,\" Everts said, \"how is it impacting our farms and our forests? And again, we want to make sure that they are in a good position to stay economically viable going forward. So we're all about making sure their businesses are successful.\"\nEverts said the research team evaluated potential impacts on local agriculture and conducted outreach with farmers and service providers.\nToward the end of the presentation, Harris shared his appreciation for the work that the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology does for farmers and the importance of keeping them in the forefront of policy and work done for the state.\n\"It's very good to hear this presentation today because so often what happens in Annapolis is we go up with a lot of emotion, a lot of heart to represent and protect the interests of Agriculture, and what you're talking about, along with other institutions, is bringing science to bear with the lens of the Eastern Shore and certainly throughout the state. The point is through the lens of agriculture, which is so important,\" Harris said.\nThe next meeting of the Eastern Shore Delegation will be held on Jan. 31 via Zoom. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Last year, Stacey Hann-Ruff, the director of arts center, announced during a presentation to the Calvert County commissioners that Annmarie Garden officials plan to expand the existing sculpture garden to include the 20-acres.\nIn 1991, Francis and Ann Marie Koenig donated the land where the facility is located. The expansion plans include a 15,000-square foot welcome center.\nThe Calvert County Master Gardeners program trains volunteer horticulture educators to support the University of Maryland Extension's initiative to educate locals about best horticulture practices.\nNoting that the greenhouse project is being supported by state grant money from the Maryland General Assembly, the Rural Maryland Council and the Cove Point Natural Heritage Trust, Edward Goodman, the local master gardener specialist, called the effort \"an amazing collaboration.\"\nGoodman told Southern Maryland News there are about 50 active master gardeners. The training course takes about three to four months to complete and is culminated by a final exam. Then, the master gardener candidate must complete 40 hours of community service.\n\"There are lots of opportunities,\" Goodman said.\nThe fledgling master gardeners share their knowledge at such venues as the North Beach Nature Center, Calvert Marine Museum and numerous other locations.\n\"The biggest thing of the mater gardener program is to educate others on sustainable horticulture practices,\" Goodman said.\nWhile he couldn't provide a timeline for when the greenhouse would be completed, Goodman said \"the project has crossed the hurdle of permitting and processing.\"\n\"This is the first step in the [expansion] plan,\" Cari DeSantis of Ann's Circle, the nonprofit organization that supports many programs and activities at Annmarie Garden.\nIn briefly addressing the gathering, Bruce Fall of the Cove Point Natural Heritage Trust commended the garden's staff and volunteers \"for bringing people in to our area with events.\"\nFall said the visitors, who come to the garden for such traffic-jamming events as Artsfest and Halloween in the Garden, spend their cash at local restaurants and other businesses, which bolsters the area's economy.\nBefore grabbing shovels for some fun in the patch of dirt where the new greenhouse will stand, plastic glasses of champagne and cider were distributed to attendees. Everyone drank a toast.\nDeSantis said the toast was \"to celebrate the public-private partnerships that make Calvert County such a beautiful place.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

At each station, volunteers talked to students about various aspects of the agricultural field, from animal sciences to land and water safety to farm drones. Organizers said that approximately 80 professionals volunteered their services during the event.\n\"It's giving these seventh graders insight to all the careers available in agriculture, not just working in a field,\" Atticks said.\nBased on feedback after last year's Ag Education Day, organizers set out to make this year's event even better. Mel Bacon, Cecil County Farm Museum's executive director and an Ag Education Day board member, said that surveys and an essay contest given to students who attended the event last year helped them hone in on what made the event shine.\nHe also noted that CCPS has been a huge help in pulling the event off and raising funds\n\"CCPS has been very supportive,\" Bacon said.\nAccording to CCPS Instructional Coordinator Day Mashongamhende, CCPS incorporated Ag Education Day as part of its curriculum for the 1,042 middle schoolers in the county this year, which allowed them to embed the event in the schedule and organize lessons around it.\n\"We teach kids fundamentals,\" Mashongamhende said. \"We see how everything connects.\"\nMashongamhende also noted that CCPS officials took a trip to the Ag Education Day held in Queen Anne's County earlier this year to incorporate ideas from that event into Cecil's own.\nOne of the major goals of the event, organizers stressed, is to interest students in the ag industry and show them that there are a wide range of career options available within ag.\nFollowing the event, there are options for students whose interest has been piqued.\n\"Search out a local 4-H club,\" recommended Paul Rickert with University of Maryland Extension, one of the event's organizers.\nAnother option is to enroll in the Ag Sciences programs that the Cecil County School of Technology offers once the students reach high school.\nAlongside the adult volunteers staffing the event, a number of CCST Ag Sciences students manned stations and worked with the students at Ag Education Day. The CCST students spoke to kids about the programs they are a part of, giving them a preview into things they could be studying in a few short years.\nStudents from non-ag programs at CCST also came at lunchtime to speak with students about their own programs, according to Rachel Coffey, an Agricultural Sciences teacher at CCST.\nCCST juniors Kaitlynne Harrigan and DeAnna Parker were part of the staff at the beekeeping station on Wednesday. The pair plan to do their capstone project on beekeeping together.\nThey enjoyed sharing their knowledge with the younger students and watching them get engaged with the subject.\n\"They're learning a bit of everything,\" said Harrigan. \"It's amazing and I get really happy when the kids ask a question.\"\nHarrigan noted that she didn't know much about ag before beginning at CCST, but finds the field fascinating.\n\"If I could recommend it to others, I would,\" Harrigan said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The site is fully built and ready for the growing season.\nThe garden features 18 raised beds for community use, one charity bed for food bank donations, and three specialty education beds planted with native pollinators, flowers, and herbs.\nIn addition to offering residents a place to grow their own food and contribute fresh produce to local food banks, the garden serves as a hands-on learning space. Through partnerships with the Maryland Department of Agriculture and the University of Maryland Master Gardener Extension Program, it supports educational programs on native plants, beneficial insects, and land management practices that protect the Chesapeake Bay.\n\"There are life science hands-on opportunities available locally,\" said organizer John McKnight.\nCounty officials, residents, and Bill Tharpe from the Maryland Department of Agriculture joined the open house to show their support for the project.\nMore information about the Kent Island Community Garden is available at kicg.online. \n\n Copyright 2025 Star Democrat.

Livestock competitions \u2014 featuring cows, pigs, goats, rabbits, horses, ducks, dogs and chickens \u2014 continued into the weekend.\n\"It's hard work,\" said Beth Hill, principal agent associate for 4-H Youth Development in Kent County, \"but it's also fun for participants and spectators alike.

Livestock were shown in the main staging arena, while rabbits and poultry had their own exhibition space. Glossy coats, straight backs, brushed fur \u2014 even moody horses \u2014 were all on display as handlers aimed to show their animals in peak form.\nThursday afternoon brought out tractor enthusiasts for the lawn tractor obstacle course.

The event even drew a visit from vintage tractor puller and former winner.\n\"I took off work just to come out and support these young fellas,\" he said.\nOn Friday, volunteer Jaime Orndorff hosted the fourth Youth Goose and Duck Call competition, judged by bird outfitter Steve Goss. Plaques for winners were provided by Mark Kwiatkowski of All For A Bird. Orndorff expressed gratitude for the support of her sponsors and contributors.\nInside the exhibit hall, judges evaluated everything from cakes to houseplants, herb arrangements, artwork, photography and even corn stalks. Select baked goods were auctioned off Saturday evening, with proceeds benefiting Kent County 4-H and the Kent Ag Center.\nThroughout the week, fairgoers enjoyed police K-9 demonstrations, archery, turkey call contests, a cornhole tournament, fashion shows and a carnival of rides and games. Youth from programs like Horizons of Kent and Queen Anne's, as well as local parks and recreation camps, attended as part of their summer activities.\nEach night featured live music from performers including Robert MacFarland, Quinn Arnold, Kevin Kemp and the Del-Mar Band. Wednesday night brought out dancers for a session led by local line dance instructor Minnie Maloney.\nFood and refreshments were a big draw, with vendors offering fried treats, funnel cake, kettle corn and ice cream. Each evening also featured a full meal sponsored by local businesses, including crab cakes, barbecue beef and grilled chicken.\nOne of the most anticipated events came Friday night: the greased pig contest. About 200 people surrounded the fence to watch children \u2014 from toddlers to teens \u2014 chase and try to catch squirming piglets sponsored by local businesses. The event was emceed by Sherrie Spray, who kept the crowd entertained with lively commentary.\nSaturday featured the return of the Power Wheels Demolition Derby for children ages 3 to 5.

She noted that gate proceeds support the Kent Ag Center and help reinvest in the fairgrounds.\nCompetition results will be posted online and published in a future edition of the Kent County News.\nHill thanked the community for their support. \"We're grateful to everyone who helped make this fair a wonderful experience.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Her swine Novalee was awarded grand champion among market hogs.Novalee started out winning first among heavyweights. Then Randy, Troyer's other hog, was awarded first among middleweights. At the final showdown, it was between Novalee, Randy, and Laurel Clarke's lightweight champion hog, Diva.\nJudge Kelsey Zepp's decision was Novalee, exclaiming one hog stood out among the others throughout the competition.\nTroyer's mother, Stacie was among her daughter's cheering campaign and beamed, \"Proud momma here! She has worked so hard.\"\nTroyer exclaimed she always did well in past competitions but was shocked that both Randy and Novalee went home winners.\nThe mixed breed hogs can hold their snouts up high as the best there is in 2025.\nTroyer pointed out the judge looks for a specific musculature among heavy weights and for middle weight Randy, the same kind of structure just slightly leaner. Zepp also looks for how clean they are and basically the potential of a quality market pig.\nHaving prize-winning hogs requires dedication. For Novalee and Randy, training started around January. Troyer walked them every day to build stamina, washed their coats making sure there were no yellow circles and ensured they had clean water.\nRecently they have found a quality feed that works for them too \u2014 Sunglow \u2014 which provides a balance of carbohydrates, amino acids, innovative ingredients, active nutrient supply, and show micronutrients.\nAll this prepared before under the bright lights of the fair, the swine were led by their handlers around the ring with pig sticks to encourage their utmost cooperation.\nThe prize was taken back home to Harmony Acres in Kennedyville, where Novalee and Randy and the Troyer family could get a little rest.\nTroyer, a graduate of Queen Anne's County High School, enjoys learning, competing and making friends in 4-H. She has one more year at the fair and will be attending Chesapeake College in the fall pursuing an early childhood teaching degree.\n\"This was a very cool experience,\" she remarked.\nSo what rewards do the grand champion hogs get?\n\"Just some street-cred around here,\" Stacie joked. \"No...correction on that...some fair-cred.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Seaweed boom? - The global market for seaweed could see significant growth; can the U.S. get in on the aquaculture and ecological wave?\n\n September 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; APG National Enterprise Editor | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 1208\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Is there a future for seaweed farming in the U.S.?Could seaweed farming see a big global aquaculture boom - along with helping clean up ocean waters challenged by climate change and environmental degradations via natural filtering systems?Rafael Cuevas Uribe and Rick Zechman want to find out - and see potential on both fronts.Zechman is associate dean of marine operations and Cuevas Uribe is a fisheries biology professor at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (Cal Poly Humboldt).They are leading a new university effort to farm seaweed (bull kelp) off the far northern coast of California.They want to see if the U.S. can boost its overall production of seaweed - which serves as a natural cleaning filter for bodies of saltwater confronted by climate change and in need of environmental remediation.Right now, the U.S. seaweed farming is concentrated in Maine, Hawaii and Alaska, according to the Cal Poly researchers.U.S. kelp and seaweed production is barely a blip in a marketplace dominated by China, Indonesia and other Asian markets in a sector that is projected to grow to $14.3 billion by 2028, according to research firm IMARC Group.The Cal Poly school created a seaweed farm in 2019 leasing space in Humboldt Bay from the local harbor district. It recently harvested a small crop of kelp from that farm.Cuevas Uribe said the school's operation is for research purposes.\"Our system is purely experimental. A commercial operation would be much larger,\" he said.Graduate students help work the farm and with research into its production and viability. Its most recent harvest entailed analyzing kelp planted onto various types of ropes \"to test growth rates and viability\" with the aim of helping \"future aquaculture entrepreneurs,\" according to the school.\u00b7 MARKETPLACE AND GROWTH POTENTIALSeaweed (or kelp) can be farmed for food and dietary uses - including sushi nori as well as for uses in soups, salads and snacks. It is an especially popular food in Asia, but could see growth as global diets look for alternatives to traditional proteins and face food insecurity challenges spurred by climate change and geopolitical conflicts.Zechman said certain types of seaweed can be used in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals as part of compounds and ingredients. Seaweed has long had herbal and homeopathic uses.Brooklyn-based business research firm IMARC pegs the worldwide commercial seaweed market at $7.5 billion in 2022, according to a new analysis released late last month. The group sees the industry growing to $14.3 billion by 2028 with an 11.64% annual growth rate between 2023 and 2028.\"The rising demand for seaweed in dietary supplements, owing to its nutritive content, flavor-enhancing, and weight loss properties, is primarily catalyzing the global seaweed market,\" IMARC writes in its August analysis.That bullish outlook has plenty of company.An Aug. 30 market analysis by Redding, California-based Meticulous Market Research Pvt. Ltd., sees significant growth potential with seaweed-based fertilizers.\"Recently, there has been a growing interest in seaweed fertilizers for higher crop production and soil quality improvement. Seaweed nutrients boost plant growth, enhance soil fertility, improve crop yield, and boost plant resistance to diseases and pests. This can reduce the need for inorganic fertilizers and pesticides, leading to safer food production,\" the group writes in its research report.Fertilizer supply chains have also been recently challenged by U.S. and European sanctions against Russia and Belarus - two of the leading fertilizer producers - over the Ukraine war.Another August report by the World Bank sees substantial growth in the seaweed aquaculture space.The international financial institution sees the potential for a $11.8 billion boom in growth in seaweed farming by 2031 with potential gains in using seaweeds/kelps in pet food, animal feed, nutritional supplements, protein alternatives and methane reducing additives.\"Seaweed farming demonstrates how development, climate and nature work together to generate value and uplift communities. Seaweed farming will be a source of nutrition security as well as an alternative to synthetic fertilizer,\" said Martien van Nieuwkoop, World Bank's global director for agriculture and food in a statement last month on the growth potentials.\u00b7 HELPING THE OCEANS, ECOSYSTEMS AND THE PLANETFor Zechman, it's not just about monetary gains and an industry boom. He sees more seaweed cultivation as a way to help clean up ocean waters.He said seaweed in animal feed could reduce methane emissions from cows.The world's 1 billion cows produce an estimated 40% of global methane emissions through manure and 'burping' - a contributor to climate change, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.Seaweed-based animal feed could help reduce cow burps and flatulence.Zechman said kelp beds off the California coast have been decreasing significantly because of a decline in sea stars. The sea stars feed on sea urchins, which feed on kelp and seaweed. More sea urchins mean less seaweed which helps keep ocean waters clean via their natural filtering.\"The technology that's involved in starting a farm for seaweed can also be used for conservation,\" he said.\u00b7 U.S. growth and market potentialSo, what about the U.S. getting in on a potential seaweed boom?Global seaweed aquaculture production has grown to 35 million tons annually.Data from FAO in 2019 showed North American seaweed production at 23,000 tons.Ninety-eight percent of the seaweed harvested globally over the past two decades has occurred in Asia with China (57%) and Indonesia (29%) leading the marketplace, according to a 2022 study by researchers with China's Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University.Other major seaweed cultivating markets include South Korea, the Philippines and Japan. Isolated and food-challenged North Korea has accounted for 1.68% of the world's seaweed farming, according to Fujian researchers' analysis.Currently, U.S production is barely a blip in the global marketplace.The Western Hemisphere has only accounted for 1.36% of global seaweed/kelp farming the past two decades, according to U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization date cited in the Fujian study.Chile has accounted for 88% of the total.That's where the Cal Poly efforts come in, according to Cuevas Uribe and Zechman.They want to see how their farming efforts work out and whether more cultivation can be brought to California, the Pacific coast and other domestic coastlines.Cuevas Uribe said pollution levels and other external factors such as oil drilling and other commercial marine uses could mean the waters are not clean enough for seaweed farming for food production and other commercial uses.But seaweed aquaculture and its natural filtering could help those same bodies of water - including the dead zones and environmentally challenged areas of the Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay, according to the U.S.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Kelp forests can grow along coastal areas in temperate climates, such as the Puget Sound, helping fish and other marine life, according to NOAA.Seaweed is best grown and cultivated on coastlines with inlets and protected bays.\"It requires fairly calm inland waters,\" Cuevas Uribe said, pointing to places such as the Atlantic coastline of Maine. \"It's got to be sheltered waters.\" \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/CREATIVE COMMONS/JAKUB HA\u00a3UN\n \nSeaweed farmers in Myanmar\n \nRAIYAN I MUHARRAMAH/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS\n \nAsian markets - including China, Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea - accounts for the vast majority of seaweed and kelp aquaculture with projections of global economic boom for the sector.\n \nCOURTESY CAL POLY HUMBOLDT\n \nCal Poly students unload a harvest from Humboldt's commercial, open-water seaweed farm.\n \nPETER SOUTHWOOD/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS\n \nA kelp forest off New Zealand's Hen and Chicken Islands \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The organization educates underserved communities about the growing opportunities in aquaculture, its benefits and sustainability and sustainability's lasting impact.\nBlack, an Easton resident, is an Eastern Shore native through and through and works in oyster restoration. \"I just think there's so much power in a little oyster,\" Black said. \"And they do so much for us. In the water and out of the water.\"\nOysters clean the Chesapeake Bay through filter feeding, which helps clarify the water; nutrient cycling, which allows oysters to process nitrogen in a way that removes it from the water; and through habitat creation, where oyster reefs can provide essential habitat for other marine species.\nHer waterman heritage and Chesapeake culture heavily inspired Black's involvement in this type of work. She said she is proud of her Eastern Shore heritage and seeks to honor her family's legacy by representing the region.\n\"I love being on the Eastern Shore so much,\" Black said. \"I mean, I may not like living here sometimes because we don't have a lot of stuff, but I love the essence and I love the culture.\"\nMinorities in Aquaculture's mission focuses on workforce development. Black said that sometimes, the name can be a deterrent, but once people get past the buzz words of diversity, equity and inclusion, they start to understand the importance of this work.\n\"If we are going to have U.S. seafood competitiveness increasing like this administration wants us to, we're going to need skilled labor to be able to do that,\" she said. \"And so it doesn't really matter if you're Black, white, purple or, whatever, we need you and your skills.\"\nBlack and the 21 members of the coalition went to D.C. to advocate for consensus legislation that aims to create federal regulations and guidelines surrounding aquaculture, such as permitting and site regulations, fish health and welfare measures, labor and equity standards, and climate and sustainability standards.\nBlack said the bill has seen a tremendous amount of support, especially in Maryland and Virginia, but there is excitement and growing interest elsewhere too.\n{p class=\"p1\"}\"I think that people are getting more curious and want to strengthen their connection and understanding to agriculture and what's going on and things like that,\" Black said.\nBlack said if anyone is interested in following along with this new initiative or her other work or wants to get involved, they should visit the website mianpo.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Santa, dressed in cowboy duds, listened to requests from believers young and old.Event chairpersons Missy Saathoff of Denton and Taylor McCann of Federalsburg were \"pleasantly surprised and impressed\" by the turnout.\"We joke and say this is our first rodeo,\" Taylor said. \"Everything's gone well, vendors seem happy, and so are we.\" \"We've had a really good crowd so far, and hopefully that keeps up throughout the day,\" Saathoff said at about 2 p.m. \"We should have a few hundred dollars to donate between Caroline-Dorchester 4-H, as well as Caroline FFA, so we're happy about that.\" Each of the three organizations received over $300, Saathoff reported Monday, Nov. 27.A tree decorating showdown garnered donations. \"Dorchester County 4-H's tree won the decorating contest (donations) by $6, so it was a close race for the contest,\" Saathoff said via text message.She estimated about 980 visitors attended the event.\"These ladies did a wonderful job; I can't say enough about how great they were,\" said Cambridge photographer Candi Taylor, who sold her wildlife photos converted to canvas on Saturday.\"I've sold a bunch of them already,\" she said. \"This (market) has been phenomenal.

    "content": "Haven Harbour marina manager talks shop and sails\n\n March 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 874\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Erik Lostrom, manager of Haven Harbour Marina Resorts in Rock Hall, is trying to keep an important industry afloat here.Boat building, boat repair and marina management.\nThe recreational marine industry.\nHe's hoping his new position on the board of directors of the Marine Trade Association of Maryland can help him support the industry that has been in his family for generations.\nTo do this there has to be new blood.\n\"We need to develop the younger generation to get them interested in the business,\" he said.\nHe acknowledged it's an aging trade and noted that schools should do a better job encouraging the industry. Trades, in his opinion, offer better pay starting out and does not come with enormous debt.\nTo get younger people enthused, he spends his time talking to the high schools.\nHe's doing his part to educate at the college level too, teaching a course on Marine Systems two nights a week, where students learn to install, troubleshoot, diagnose and repair marine equipment and systems.\nThe class consists of some late teens but also boat owners who wish to gain knowledge about the hobby they enjoy.\nIn the classroom, his students have the benefit of learning from a man coming from a long line of shipbuilders. His grandfather on his mother's side, Elmer Rosenblad was a master shipbuilder during World War II.\nHis father, Robert F. Lostrom built wooden boats as well.\nHe carries on that tradition, working in naval architecture and boat building before settling into boat repair.\n\"It's in my blood I guess. I've built 15 types of wooden boats.\"\nBeing born on the Jersey shore was an ideal place to learn those skills. After high school, Lostrom pursued his passion in Kennebunkport, Maine, the location of the infamous Bush compound. In Kennebunkport, at the Landing School Lostrom spent two years of intensive study being instructed on wooden boat building and yacht design.\nGraduating in 1989, he found a way to ply his trade, in Philadelphia at the Independence Seaport Museum.\nHis marine versatility grabbed the attention of Kent County residents, the Johnson family in Quaker Neck. They owned a log canoe that was built in 1890, they wanted restored. After several months, working with a crew, Lostrom completed the job.\nHe remarked it was so efficient it started winning races.\nOver a summer watching the log canoe compete, soaking in the sights and sounds on the Chesapeake Bay, Lostrom said he fell in love with Kent County. He found a job at Higgins Yacht Yard in Saint Michaels around 1995 and has lived on the Eastern Shore ever since.\nWith forty years experience he's a good candidate to keep our elected officials informed about the issues of the business.\nHe was nominated to the board the Marine Trade Association of Maryland board in December.\nA group that consists of marina owners, boat builders and boat suppliers, they lobby with the state on regulations to support the marinas. Lostrom will be helping in the area of workplace development.\nThey'll be addressing all the changes in the industry. An industry, he said which is a luxury business.\nLostrom further described it as a \"sunset dream industry.\"\n\"The people who sail, have a dream view in mind, of having a cocktail and cruising on their boat,\" he added.\nThe business may be luxury, but it is also vital to the economy on the Bay.\nAccording to John Stefancik, executive director of Marine Trades Association of Maryland, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting the recreational marine industry, the annual economic impact to Maryland is $4.2 billion. He estimated that in Kent County that could be tens of millions.\nWith approximately 350 marinas in the state and only 1100 workers, Lostrom sees the challenges ahead.\nThere is lack of experienced skilled trade labor to service customer vessels in a timely manner.\nHe said, \"The customer base has become more 'turnkey' type users putting more demand on skilled labor to keep vessels operating.\"\nFor instance, vacationers might have two weeks to get their yacht in the water. If it's still in the shop for repairs, and the boats are backed up, they might decide to sell it and stop living that specific dream.\nA dream doesn't have to be limited to the boat owners either.\nIt could also be a dream for a lot of young men and women on the Shore, who hunt, fish, boat and love the outdoors.\nA career outside of a cubicle.\nThere is a need for workers, Lostrom said. All marine trades are needed, from mechanics, marine plumbing to administrative work.\nWith a salary range starting at $40,000 that can go upward to $200,000, it could be a good option.\nLostrom pointed to one local success story, a life long employee of his. Under Lostrom, the employee learned about working with wood, received tips on proper use of tools and was instructed on fiberglass repair, engine mechanics and proper maintenance.\nAnd he's doing it where he loves, working outside around the boating environment. And at Haven Harbour, a business that Stefancik indicated is one of the largest marinas in the state.\nBetween balancing the responsibilities of his marina, Lostrom will be lobbying across the state, passionate over his newfound responsibilities.\n\"I want people who read this to know that this is a professional career. A trade that should be treated as such.\"\nIn April, Lostrom will be conducting a career fair; the exact date to be determined later. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "University of Delaware breaks ground on $150M biopharmaceutical manufacturing center\n\n April 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 506\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A new $150 million facility at the University of Delaware will provide a space for testing new biopharmaceutical manufacturing practices as well as train workers in the highly technical skills needed to produce advanced medications.UD, state and federal officials broke ground Monday on the SABRE Center, which stands for Securing American Biomanufacturing Research and Education.\nThe 70,000-square-foot SABRE Center will be located on the STAR Campus next to the Ammon Pinizzotto Biopharmaceutical Innovation Center.\nIt's meant to be an extension of the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL), which is already located on the STAR Campus.\nNIIMBL is a UD-led coalition of nearly 200 companies, educational institutions, nonprofits and state governments. The public-private partnership is designed to accelerate innovation in the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry, which produces vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, gene therapies and other medical products derived from biological sources.\nNIIMBL Director Kelvin Lee said the SABRE Center will allow researchers to further test and refine innovations developed at NIIMBL.\n\"This facility would provide a place where we can actually test how those technologies work in a manufacturing environment,\" Lee said. \"And then if we need to modify or make adjustments to make it more suitable, we then have those lessons learned.\"\nSen. Chris Coons said the COVID-19 pandemic, and the speed at which a vaccine was developed, demonstrated the power of biopharmaceuticals.\n\"What is going to be possible with this institute, with its next phase, is to speed up the cycle of innovation,\" Coons said.\nThat innovation, he said, will give birth to new companies.\n\"Spinning out from that will be a remarkable next generation of opportunities for Delawareans to work in biotech and in manufacturing, for companies to be launched here and regionally,\" Coons said.\nSABRE will also be a training ground for people looking to develop the skills needed to work in high-tech biopharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\"This facility provides an opportunity for people to get trained in how you gown up properly, how you move through a facility properly, how you actually operate pieces of equipment,\" Lee said.\nHaving a skilled workforce here will help attract new pharmaceutical companies to Delaware. UD officials have previously said that the SABRE Center will bring 3,500 jobs to Delaware over the next decade.\n\"Places that have very effective training programs typically find a significant amount of capital investment coming down the road, where companies want to build their factories there because they know they can access a talent pool to staff their factories,\" Lee said.\nSen. Tom Carper said the SABRE Center is an important addition to the STAR Campus, which already boasts 1 million square feet of new development on what used to be the Chrysler assembly plant.\n\"While we're not going to build tanks here anymore, we're not going to build Chrysler products here anymore, we are going to be building facilities that help provide medicines that will make us a healthier country and a healthier world,\" Carper said.\nSo far, the SABRE Center has secured $45 million in investment from the federal government and $30 million from the state.\nLee declined to say when the new facility will open. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lierman calls for better support of day care in Maryland\n\n May 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 640\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 On April 26, Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman made a stop to visit the Talbot County Council on her tour of the Eastern Shore. She has been traveling around the state to let different county councils know what the comptroller is up to.Her stops emphasized getting women back into the workplace in Maryland by supporting them with better day care.\nThe council members asked questions after Lierman's 15-minute update.\n\"I have three key roles as comptroller. No. 1 is to act as an elected CFO. To see every dollar in and every dollar out of the state. We also pay all the employees and balance all the books with a general accounting of the state. The second responsibility is that we act as, or I am on, a number of financial boards for the state,\" Lierman said.\nShe said she was on the Board of Public Works, which approves major contracts and any contract or grant over $200,000. She is on the State Retirement and Pension System Board with $65 billion in assets.\nHer third role as comptroller is revenue administrator.\n\"We just finished tax season, and I will give you a little update,\" Lierman said. \"We have processed about $2.7 billion tax returns. We are ahead of schedule from last year. We have sent out refunds to 1.7 million Maryland households.\"\nThen Lierman got into how the Board of Public Works affects Talbot County.\n\"We have approved five projects worth almost $1 million since I took office,\" she said. \"For the renovation and expansion of the St. Michaels Library and a 665-foot living shoreline as well.\"\nShe touted the modernization of her office.\n\"Louis Goldstein used to brag that he took the Office of the Comptroller from pencil and paper to the mainframe. We now we are moving from the mainframe to the cloud. \u2026 The online portal is called Maryland Tax Connect. We launched it in February,\" she said.\nThe number of workers is affecting the state's economic profile.\n\"We are constrained in our economic growth because we don't have the labor force we need. We have seen a lower labor force participation rate in Maryland since the pandemic. Other states have rebounded, and we have not. We have lost around 181,000 workers since COVID,\" she said.\nOne of the key demographics is loss of women in the workforce.\n\"We lost about 2%, and nationally was about 1%. One of the key reasons that we did see, and that was cited, is the cost of child care,\" she said.\nEarlier in the day, Lierman visited Critchlow Adkins Day Care Children's Center of Easton and found that they have a waiting list of over 100 people for their services.\n\"If we are talking about the economy and we are not talking about child care, we are missing a big part of the picture. It is a key piece of economic development,\" she said.\n\"We are the eighth most costly state for child care in the nation right now. We lost a number of child care spots in the pandemic, and we haven't recovered all of them. We need accessible, and affordable and high quality child care available for families who want to have working parents, who need to get out into the workforce,\" Lierman said.\nThe council members had questions for Lierman.\nCouncil member Lynne Mielke asked about affordable housing. Lierman responded with statistics about the population shrinking in Maryland because people are moving away. People are moving from high-cost to low-cost-of-living states.\nShe said the No. 1 reason for people moving is the cost of housing.\n\"The support for housing really comes from the Department of Housing and Community Development budget,\" she said.\n\"Part of your housing crunch is because you have so many short-term rentals. It used to be long-term rentals. You on the Shore face this,\" Lierman said.\nLierman invited those who want to learn more about her office and Maryland's economy to go to marylandtaxes.gov. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We celebrate not only their accomplishments but also the bright futures that each of them is carving out in our community,\" she said.\n\"META is a six month intensive business development and coaching program aimed at providing a cohort of small minority businesses with the resources they need to scale,\" said Sam Shoge, cofounder and partner of Rivers and Roads Consulting, who served as program facilitator and coach.\nThe program intends to close the knowledge resource and funding gap between minority-owned and non-minority owned businesses, he said.\nData is applied across all minority businesses including women-owned and veteran-owned, he said, and the importance of the program is noted in the disparities between minority and non-minority owned businesses, he said.\nThe average revenue of black sole proprietorships versus non-minority sole proprietorships is $22,000 versus $50,000 respectively, according to Shoge.\nOn average non-minority owned businesses are six times larger than black-owned businesses, he said.\nA total of 15 applications from women and minority owned businesses were received in 2023 and five Queen Anne's County businesses were selected to participate in the inaugural program, he said.\nParticipants included Moniesha Baynard, owner of Three Guys and a Girl Personal Chef and Catering; Diane Moorman-White, owner of DMW Soul Fitness; Timeka Wheeler, owner of Long Live Assisted Living; Deayna Ewell, owner of Onyx Beauty Supply Salon Barbershop; and Ebony Johnson, owner of Tips and Toes Nail Studio.\nThe six-month program at the Kent Island Library began its first seminar in February 2024 and concluded in August.\nMETA entailed monthly business development seminars including a variety of topics such as market strategy, business planning, sales and customer service, bookkeeping best practices, licensing and regulation as well as personal coaching, Shoge said.\nA key aspect of the program was how entrepreneurs can partner and collaborate and support fellow community small businesses, he said.\n\"Our secretary of commerce Secretary (Micheal) Gill always said that economic development is a team sport and that is very much reflected in this program here,\" Shoge said.\nOfficials were very happy with the outcome and success of the program, with many participants reporting increased revenues, Shoge said.\nTransitioning from a 36-year veterinary career, participant Moorman-White, credited the program with giving her the push and the confidence to prove to herself she could turn her \"side-gig\" into a full time career.\n\"Probably the biggest thing the META program has done for me was it changed my mindset. I am now recognizing the power I possess to achieve my goals both big and small,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Battle lines being drawn for tax fights in 2025\n\n April 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 790\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier this month I joined countless Marylanders in filing my federal and state income tax returns.As I did so, the timeless observations of Benjamin Franklin came to mind: \"In this world nothing is certain except death and taxes.\"\nAfter the Maryland General Assembly adjourned, I suggest Ben was only partly right.\nI suggest that in Maryland, almost certain are new state taxes, state tax increases, new state fees and state fee increases. The only uncertainties about them are when and how much.\nBefore the 2024 Maryland General Assembly adjourned for the year, this matter was discussed at length but never fully settled. Some relatively modest tax and fee increases were approved, but none as large as or as far reaching as expected.\nNone will be approved throughout the balance of this year. The earliest formal discussions on any tax increases can happen is after the General Assembly reconvenes in January 2025.\nBattle lines are already being drawn.\nProponents and opponents of tax increases are busy organizing and promoting their positions. Not surprisingly, there are stark and irreconcilable differences between them.\nThe Maryland Public Policy Institute recently released a statement headlined \"Tax increases Are Never Inevitable.\"\nThe statement includes the following messages: \"Maryland's political leaders would have us believe the state is in a fiscal mess through no fault of their own and that the only solution is massive tax hikes that they've put on hold \u2014 for now. This narrative, however, both misrepresents the problem and ignores a real and preferable solution. When pressed, responsible lawmakers admit that the primary cause of the budget chaos at both state and county levels is the Blueprint for Maryland's Future (a.k.a. Kirwan) education plan. The Spending Affordability Committee projected that budget shortfalls will increase substantially over the next five years \"due to the need for general funds to support costs related to the Blueprint.\"\nThe recommended treatments are to \"minimize the enactment of new mandates,\" increase \"efficiency,\" and \"consider revenue options.\" Sadly, legislators seem focused only on that last tactic \u2014 i.e., tax hikes. But the Blueprint is not Holy Writ etched in stone. And tax hikes on hard-working Marylanders are not inevitable. Instead of pretending to have no way out, lawmakers could choose to alter the Blueprint's mandates or eliminate it altogether.\"\nSupporters of Kirwan especially the Democratic super majorities in the General Assembly and the state teachers' union have a much different view.\nThey support increasing state revenues to a level to ensure Kirwan is fully implemented as it was written when the current version was approved by the General Assembly.\nThey believe they have public support for that. They may be right.\nA recent article in the Baltimore Sun had the following headline: \"Majority of Statewide Voters Support Blueprint for Maryland's Future.\"\nThe article included the following.\n\"An overwhelming majority of Marylanders support the state's ambitious Blueprint for Maryland's Future education plan, according to a new poll done for The Baltimore Sun, the University of Baltimore and FOX45. Nearly three quarters of the 1,300 likely general election voters polled across Maryland said they supported the Blueprint. When the poll asked about potential changes to the plan to lessen its financial pressures on local [education] budgets, 55% said they supported making some reduction, such as cutting all-day prekindergarten programs (24%), or teacher pay raises (11%). However, 29% said they would not cut anything.'\"\nThe professional pollster who conducted the survey opined the results indicate \"profound, widespread\" support among voters for the landmark education plan, tempered by \"a willingness to set adjustments.\nHe further observed, \"It's very hard to argue against public education. The intent [of the Blueprint] tracks with the priorities of Maryland voters.\"\nI suggest the results of this survey, like the results of all surveys, only reflect public sentiment at a point in time. How durable those poll results has yet to be seen.\nThe pollster did acknowledge one huge unresolved issue that cannot be ignored going forward.\nHe said, \"Local school boards will have to balance how to fund their school districts with meeting their Blueprint financial burden, which could force [school board] members to cut local initiatives. Will it force school boards to cut other things? That's where the electoral equation changes.\"\nThat is a key observation that leads to to more certainty on discussions and debates on taxes and fees in Maryland.\nBetween now and January 2025, supporters and opponents of Kirwan will be aggressively engaged in efforts to inform, galvanize and mobilize voters to support their respective positions ranging from maintaining Kirwan as presently written, adopting modifications to Kirwan and the necessity for and scope of revenue sources needed to fully fund implantation of whatever the final form Kirwan turns out to be.\nDepending on the outcomes, those efforts may continue well beyond next year.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The facility will have a gym, tech lab, game room and classrooms. It will also have a museum and cultural center to honor the area's African American history during and following segregation.\n\"We have a lot of work to do,\" Jeff Breslin, president and CEO of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Metropolitan Baltimore, said during a Dorchester Chamber of Commerce luncheon on Oct. 29. \"We're still fundraising every single day.\"\nWith about $8 million raised so far, Breslin said there is a $4.5 million funding gap. He said they feel confident in getting $3 million of that funding and so they are pushing for the final $1.5 million.\nBreslin said so far, the building \u2014 which is the vacant Mace's Lane High School \u2014 has had its roof and windows replaced and its facade updated. He said there have been remediation efforts inside, including asbestos removal.\n\"But really, we're just about shovel-ready to get the inside done,\" he said in an interview.\nBreslin said the start of the project's third phase, which they hope to begin in early 2025, is dependent on funding.\nThe Rev. Keith Cornish said raising the remaining funds for the project will ensure \"everyone wins.\"\n\"Every part of our society will be impacted,\" he said about the community center.\nCornish is board president of Mace's Lane Community Center, a nonprofit that was formed by the Good Shepherd Association and the Mace's Lane High School Alumni Association. He compared the Boys and Girls Club at Mace's Lane Community Center to fertilizer for the school system.\n\"When they come alongside and help the school system, everyone benefits,\" he said.\nBreslin said across the country, every dollar invested in the Boys and Girls Clubs returns $10.32 in economic benefits to club members, their families and society. He said in Maryland, every dollar invested in the Boys and Girls Clubs returns $7.64.\nBreslin said that since opening the Boys and Girls Club at Leonards Lane in Cambridge in 2021, there has been a 35% decrease in juvenile crime within 0.3 miles of the club. He said that percentage has been controlled for recent juvenile reform laws.\n\"Ultimately it just means that when kids have somewhere safe and predictable and hopeful to go, we know what it does for the community,\" Breslin said.\nDuring the lunch, Breslin introduced Leonards Lane Club Manager Gabe Butler and the organization's Manager of Community and Youth Support Kentavius Jones.\nButler said when kids come into the club, they are given dinner and time for homework help and tutoring before going through Boys and Girls Club programming. Programs deal with health and wellness, career and workforce readiness, social emotional wellness, and more. After programming, the children are given time to \"just have fun and play,\" Butler said.\nJones talked about the importance of focussing on social emotional learning. He said COVID-19 had a negative impact on the social emotional wellness of this generation of kids.\n\"So learning healthy connections, how to relate to people, how to express what you're thinking, what's going on \u2014 our kids are struggling with that,\" he said.\nThose who are interested in donating to the Mace's Lane Community Center project can donate at bgcmetrobaltimore.org/donate or maceslanecc.org/. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This was the site of lunch and learn for the Caroline County Women in Business.\nIt was a fun moment of delight to see and touch these creatures from the Andes.\n\"Look at them following her. This is hilarious,\" Tracey Snyder, director of the Caroline County Chamber of Commerce, said.\n\"We love the alpaca farm. This is the second time the chamber has been here.

She is going to show us how to be a little more zen in our hectic lives,\" Snyder said.\nOwner of Outstanding Dreams Alpaca Farm Phil Liske gave a talk on the animal's behavior.\nAfter the animal interaction, it was time to listen to the keynote speaker, healer Michelle Boulden Hammond.\n\"We are talking about mindfulness today. It is a peaceful forum and how to handle stress today. Some spiritual message like how to learn about frequencies. Learn about how to get yourself grounded. We will learn stress management techniques,\" Hammond said.\nShe said it is even beneficial for the animals and their frequencies. She specializes in sound healing.\n\"We are going to do a little breath work. I have got my sound bowls. I got my tuning forks and I have my ocean drum. So I will give a little demonstration. I have a brass and I have a crystal bowl,\" Hammond said.\nShe also had a comment on the current moment.\n\"In these times of high stress, there is a lot of hostility. You have got to learn to get grounded and centered.

    "content": "Budget, Blueprint, energy are top issues for Shore legislators this session\n\n January 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: General Assembly \n \n 710\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 As Eastern Shore legislators prepare to cross the bridge and return to Annapolis for the first day of the Maryland General Assembly's 2025 legislative session on Wednesday, the state's budget is top of mind.\"It's just a tough time right now, and we're going to have to be very cautious and very thoughtful of the citizens and the impacts that our citizens are feeling,\" Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said in an interview with the Star Democrat.\nThe state is facing a predicted $2.7 billion budget deficit in fiscal year 2026. Jacobs said when it comes to the budget process this year, he thinks everything will be on the table. \"The devil is in the details,\" he said.\n\"We're certainly \u2014 on the Shore \u2014 fiscal conservatives concerned with any cost increase, any tax increase or any cost toward citizens,\" Jacobs said.\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said he hopes state Democrats realize that some state goals, such as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and some climate initiatives, are unrealistic and need to be reexamined.\n\"So I hope there's some reality checks,\" he said.\nDel. Jefferson Ghrist (R- Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said the state has overspent. He said although House leadership seems to be ok with raising taxes to balance the budget, the governor might not be \"comfortable\" with that.\nGhrist said he expects to see a \"clash\" in the Democratic Party regarding the budget.\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) sees this legislative session as a \"defining\" one for Gov. Wes Moore (D).\n\"He's going to have to balance this out within his own party,\" Mautz said about Moore. \"Because the policies that are in place now that have caused these economic problems largely come from the Democratic Party and Democratic leadership.\"\nBLUEPRINT FOR MARYLAND'S FUTUREThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future is another issue that legislators on the Shore expect to be one of the top issues this legislative session.\nThe Blueprint \u2014 a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and education quality across the state \u2014 has garnered some concern across the state due to funding challenges.\nHutchinson said that with a budget shortfall, the state should be \"pulling back\" on the Blueprint. He said the plan has \"been devastating\" to counties across the state.\nJacobs said he thinks this legislative session will result in adjustments to the timeline of certain Blueprint goals.\n\"I don't think that they're going to do away with Blueprint by any means,\" he said. \"I just think that there may be some changes in the timeline of different parts of it.\"\nMautz said \"something has to happen\" with the Blueprint. He said he isn't sure if legislators will create bills \"to address the damage that's been done\" or create bills that put pauses on the plan.\nENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTFrom solar energy to electric vehicles, Eastern Shore legislators see energy and environment issues as important heading into this legislative session.\nGhrist called the state's renewable energy goals \"virtually impossible to achieve.\" He said he has concerns about who is controlling where solar energy systems are being placed in the state. He plans to put out \"several\" bills that address solar energy.\n\"Our number one industry is agriculture and it's being threatened right now by solar,\" he said.\nJacobs said he has heard that there have been some \"serious conversations\" about expanding nuclear energy in the state. He said he hopes state leadership and legislative committees that deal with energy issues will look more into nuclear energy and figure out if it's a direction the state should be going in.\nWhen it comes to electric vehicles, Hutchinson said he doesn't think the state has the capacity for its electric vehicle initiatives.\n\"There's not enough power stations to be able to charge them,\" he said. \"And based upon what I'm hearing from our local dealers, there's not a market for them and they want to stay with combustible engines.\"\nHutchinson said he expects a lot of debate this session.\n\"And again, I hope that we see some reality coming that we can't continue to afford to spend and that we have to make sure we address this $2.7 billion short fall that's going to get worse and worse each year if we don't do anything today,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore's recent State of the State address painted a rosy picture of Maryland's future, but as your state senator, I need to be straight with you about where we really stand.Maryland currently ranks 43rd in economic outlook and faces a staggering $3 billion deficit that could balloon to $7 billion by 2030. This crisis wasn't created by Gov. Hogan or the Trump administration \u2014 it's the predictable result of expensive, unfunded policies and overregulation pushed through by the Democratic supermajority in Annapolis.\nThe most glaring omission from the governor's hourlong speech? The crushing cost of living hitting Eastern Shore families right now, especially those sky-high utility bills. His solution is to raise taxes on businesses and high earners, but we all know those costs always find their way down to workers, consumers, and our local businesses.\nLet's break down what's really happening in Annapolis:\nInstead of cutting wasteful programs, the governor wants to raise taxes and increase spending. Maryland already has one of the worst tax burdens in the country. His budget talks about job creation but ignores how businesses keep fleeing to states with lower taxes and fewer regulations.\nThe governor doubled down on the Blueprint for Maryland's Future \u2014 a massive unfunded mandate our counties and state can't afford. His proposed $1.6 billion in savings falls woefully short when we're facing a $4 billion annual shortfall to implement it.\nRather than working to control costs, the state has unleashed almost universal increases for licenses and other fees, accompanied by aggressive property tax assessment increases. Aspirational environmental mandates are being reenforced rather than reexamined, while they continue to drive costs. This includes their enormous impact on agriculture in comparison to the meager and in many instances, unmeasurable benefits. Meanwhile, the economy on the Chesapeake Bay has been strangled by poor management strategies that range across the board from the blue crab fishery to migratory waterfowl.\nHere are a couple immediate actions to cut costs: eliminate thousands of funded, vacant positions; repeal costly mandates in the Blueprint that have not been implemented; cut wasteful spending like the Red Line Study and mass transit; and stop the new $2 billion annual payroll tax for paid family leave. Finally, there must be some incentive for agencies to save money rather than exhaust budgets to ensure they are funded in the following year.\nMeanwhile, crime is a very real problem in Maryland and while ending recidivism is essential, the lack of attention and urgency over repeat offenders is alarming. The Eastern Shore way has always been practical and commonsense, there are options that support economic growth, environmental and educational improvement, and promote public safety without breaking the bank. That's what we should be supporting \u2014 not costly mandates from Annapolis. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Shore legislators worry about tax hikes, energy, education in the wake of General Assembly\n\n April 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 802\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The Maryland General Assembly session officially ended Monday night. Lawmakers fought through a very tough fiscal year budget, which had some significant impacts for Eastern Shore communities, legislators said.Members of the Eastern Shore delegation stressed budget difficulties loom over state lawmakers, who spent much of this year's session tackling an over $3 billion deficit.\n\"I think the session was not a good session,\" Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said. \"We've just made Maryland a very expensive, more expensive than it was, and it's going to make us less competitive in the region.\n\"If you believe that economic competitiveness is in fact a priority, I think that it is, and I think that by raising taxes and fees, both at the state level and then forcing the locals to also increase their fees and taxes is a double whammy.\"\nMaryland lawmakers passed a balanced budget Monday, concluding their spring session after months of grappling with the deficit. The final budget included about $2 billion in cuts and about $1.6 billion in tax hikes.\n\"I think we left frustrated that we had to raise taxes $1.66 billion and there was no regard to wanting to really seriously cut expenses from the state budget,\" said Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico).\nEastern Shore Delegation members believe after this year's session, the Shore will see lasting effects both fiscally and in several key industries.\nSolar\nOne of the biggest concerns for the Mid-Shore this budget session has been solar energy.\nA renewable energy bill aimed at increasing generation of energy within the state by promoting solar energy production was passed by both chambers of the state legislature.\nSome Eastern Shore Delegation members feel provisions added to these bills during legislators' deliberations supersede counties' authority regarding solar permitting and regulation.\n\"It undermines all the work that the counties have already done to try to facilitate where and how to put solar,\" Mautz said. \"It includes a new assessment for planting solar, which is going to raise energy costs.\"\nHutchinson echoed this sentiment, saying, \"It falls on deaf ears that the Democrats from Montgomery and Prince George's county all think that they know how the quality of life is here on the Eastern Shore.\"\nUtility bills\nHouse Bill 1035 and Senate Bill 937, known collectively as the \"Next Generation Energy Act,\" include plans to reduce energy bills and address shortfalls by modernizing the state's energy infrastructure and incentivizing in-state energy production.\nEastern Shore Delegation members believe this effort to get the cost down lacked the immediacy rate payers need to address bill hikes.\n\"We have not addressed the number one complaint I received when I arrived in January,\" Hutchinson said, \"rate payers calling to say that their electric bills are astronomical. We put legislation forward to try to lower utility bills, and again, it falls on deaf ears.\"\nEducation funding\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education improvement and funding initiative through 2032, originally outlined an increase in teacher collaborative time, during which teachers are not in classes and can plan, grade or meet with students individually. But with adjustments made in the state's budget to combat the deficit, funding to implement the change has been postponed.\nThe Blueprint also sustained several other cuts and freezes that impact county finances. Multiple Mid-Shore county school boards have had to make budget cut decisions and potential layoffs in response.\n\"So let me take Dorchester County, for example,\" Hutchinson said. \"They pushed down the teachers' pensions. They pushed down the Blueprint. They pushed down other mandates that the state usually paid for, but now it's all the county, they have to pay for (it).\"\n\"The school board is short about $5 million. They just eliminated summer school,\" he said. \"They're looking at having to lay off student support personnel. They say we want to create a world-class education. Yet you look at the results of what's happening in Maryland and say that doesn't make sense.\"\nPotential special sessions\nWhile the 2025 session has ended, Mautz doesn't believe discussion is officially over.\nAs the federal government continues to shift funding priorities, state legislators may need to reconvene to address any impacts this has on the balanced budget, he said.\n\"Counties are probably going to have to raise revenue through taxes and different things,\" Mautz said. \"The federal government is probably going to continue to reduce spending. Then there's a high likelihood that we're going to have a special session.\"\n\"So we would have to go back to Annapolis again to address any changes that that come from federal spending reductions. Just as the federal government is reducing its spending, the state is doing the same thing to the counties, and so where all this ends, it seems to be, taxpayer, taxpayer, taxpayer.\n\"Everybody should know it's very hard to predict how this is all going to play out, but I don't think the discussion about the budget is is officially over.\" \n\n Copyright 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Court rules digital ad tax violates First Amendment\n\n August 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BRYAN P. SEARS Maryland Matters | Section: State News \n \n 461\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A provision in Maryland's digital ad tax is an unconstitutional restriction on free speech, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.The 2021 law \u2014 the first of its kind in the nation \u2014 imposes taxes on large tech companies for the digital ads they sell within the state. But it prohibits those companies from passing the tax on to consumers as a surcharge, fee or line item on their bills \u2014 what a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals saw as a ban on telling customers about the new added tax.\nIn a ruling that invoked American protests against the Colonial-era Stamp Act, Circuit Judge Julius Richardson wrote that, as then, \"complaining about taxes remains a grand American political tradition.\" And the court said Maryland lawmakers went too far by adding language to the tax bill that was intended to shield them from public criticism.\n\"Perhaps fearing such complaints, Maryland paired its tax with another rule,\" Richardson wrote for the court. \"Companies that make money advertising on the internet must not only pay the tax, but avoid telling their customers how it affects pricing: No line items, no surcharges, no fees.\n\"If companies pass on the cost of the tax, they must do so in silence \u2014 keeping customers in the dark about why prices have gone up and thereby insulating Maryland from political responsibility,\" he wrote.\nThe ruling reverses a 2024 decision by U.S. District Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby, who agreed with the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of tech firms and business associations \u2014 that the law created some First Amendment issues. But she let the law stand because the offending provision had \"many constitutional applications.\"\nFriday's circuit court ruling sent the case back to Griggsby with instructions to determine an appropriate remedy for the plaintiffs.\nThe ruling is a blow to officials who looked to the unique tax to help pay for expensive K-12 education reforms contained in the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. Expenses associated with that law continue to rise and are potentially budget busting \u2014 even if the digital ad tax survives the onslaught of legal challenges.\nThe 2021 law \u2014 sponsored by Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) \u2014 targets big tech firms including Apple, Meta and Google.\nUnder the law, companies reporting $100 million of gross global annual revenue are subject to a 2.5% levy. The tax increases in increments of 2.5% to a maximum rate of 10% levied against companies reporting more than $15 billion in gross global revenue.\nThe state could collect as much as $250 million annually from the digital ad tax, according to a legislative analysis. The funds are earmarked for the education reform program.\nNeither Ferguson nor Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D), the defendant in the lawsuit, immediately responded to requests for comment on the ruling Friday. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The forum included a presentation by Cambridge resident and environmental advocate Susan Olsen, a Q & A and a moderated discussion.Olsen's presentation outlined what climate change is and its affects on the Eastern Shore before diving in to discuss Maryland's Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022.\"We are doing a great job in Maryland,\" Olsen said. \"The Climate Solutions Now Act of '22 is the most ambitious greenhouse gas reduction program in our country.\" The act requires the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions through setting new goals and developing emissions reduction requirements.Olsen said environmental justice is a large part of the environmental bills being passed.She said the Climate Solutions Now Act uses tax incentives to encourage community solar for low and moderate income Marylanders.Community solar gives utility customers who rent or are unable to purchase solar panels the option to power their homes with solar energy through a subscription, according to the Maryland Office of People's Counsel.\"It's wonderful,\" Olsen said. \"It really is.\" Olsen ended her presentation by sharing how residents can be a part of the solution in Dorchester County and on the Eastern Shore.She mentioned tree grants from the state's 5 Million Trees Initiative. The grants can pay for trees that are planted in public areas. Olsen said that folks who are interested in getting involved with planting trees can look into the ShoreRivers Tree Stewards program.Other ways to get involved include joining environmental groups or lobbying for the implementation, compliance and enforcement of the Climate Solutions Now Act.Olsen also talked about her experience trying to get Dorchester County Public Schools on board with electric buses. She said the Environmental Protection Agency has been giving out grants to school districts to trade in their diesel school buses for electric, propane or low-emission buses.\"Last year, we were a priority district,\" Olsen said about Dorchester County Public Schools.\"They would pay the full cost of the buses.\" However, Olsen said the Dorchester County Board of Education decided against switching to zero-and low-emission buses.Maris Wicker, who attended the forum, said she remembers when the Board was discussing this.\"I was very disappointed to learn that there was not a move toward electric buses,\" Wicker said. \"I thought it could have been a great learning moment for kids riding school buses.\" Olsen said that while Dorchester County is no longer a priority district for this grant - meaning the EPA would only fund a percentage of the cost of each bus-it is still possible for the district to get involved with the program.Sarah Gavian, chair of the Dorchester Dems Committee, said she could see a group of advocates coming together for this issue.\"I think there probably is a lot of momentum around things that could be done to support at least understanding what Dorchester can win and lose from (with electric) school buses,\" Gavian said. \"I think (we could) probably find some advocates in this room to work with Susan on this.\" Forum attendees also talked about how to improve and increase recycling in the area.During her presentation, Olsen said that recycling correctly can decrease the amount of methane, a greenhouse gas, in landfills.Miriam Zijp said that when it comes to recycling in Dorchester County, the problem is information.\"People don't know how to recycle,\" Zijp said. \"But they don't get taught.\" Zijp suggested creating programs to teach children how to recycle.\"You have to start somewhere,\" she said. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nMary Dennard-Turner talks about recycling at a forum on climate change hosted by the Dorchester Dems on Aug. 2 at the organization's headquarters in Cambridge. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gov. Aruna Miller. \"The growth of this program is essential; it not only addresses the urgency required by an escalating climate crisis, but it closely aligns with our administration's commitment to service and to empowering our youth to gain real-world professional skills.\" The Class of 2022-2023 was made up of students from Allegany, Anne Arundel, Caroline, Howard, Montgomery, Talbot, Washington and Worcestor counties and Baltimore City.They were addressed briefly by seven special guests: Miller, Comptroller Brooke Lierman, Maryland Senate President William Ferguson, Maryland Senator Pamela Beidle, Maryland Energy Administration Director Paul Pinsky, BGE Sr. Vice President Alexander Nunez, and Chesapeake Bay Trust President Dr. Jana Davis. Each speaker touched on the potential each of the graduates have to continue the fight to protect Maryland's environment and the restoration efforts of the Chesapeake Bay.Pinsky told the graduates, \"Never doubt what you can do to change things for the better. A group of young people in Wyoming brought action in court to protect the environment there. Those young people are the same ages you are. You do the same thing they did, if the cause arises.\" Beidle also focused on the power of individuals. Quoting Margaret Mead, she said, \"The power and influence of one person has always been the force for change throughout history.\" The CCCC was created by the Maryland General Assembly in 2010. It is administered by the Chesapeake Bay Trust. The multi-faceted expansion of the program to include more intentional climate work is possible due to the additional $1.5 million per year investment from the State of Maryland.CCCC provides career and leadership training for young people interested in environmental careers.Corps members are matched with non-profit and government host organizations and receive firsthand training on a wide variety of topics on the realms of climate, energy, watershed restoration, agriculture, forestry and education.\"The goal of our Corps program is to create future generations of environmental stewards who are poised to address climate change and other environmental challenges, either in their personal or professional lives or both,\" Davis said. \"I am so proud of these amazing young people. Their efforts not only serve the environment, but also boost local economies and revitalize often underserved neighborhoods.\" The 55 selected 2023-24 Chesapeake Conservations and Climate Corps participants will serve this year in Anne Arundel, Charles, Calvert, Garrett, Howard, Kent, Montgomery, Prince George's, Talbot and Worcester counties, and Baltimore City. \n \n Caption: DOUG BISHOP/BAY TIMES AND RECORD OBSERVER\n \nMembers of the 2022-2023 Chesapeake Conservation and Climate Corps receive the symbolic golden shovel from previous graduates following their graduation, Tuesday, Aug. 15, at the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Center in Grasonville.

The Farm to Bay Trail winds its way through cool season grass meadows, warm season grass meadows, brackish wetlands, freshwater wetlands, pine forest, emergent hardwood forest, mature hardwood forest and gives up close views of agriculture on Delmarva on a working farm.While exploring the habitats, about half of the trail borders agriculture fields while the other half borders brackish Pickering Creek.The trail affords a rare opportunity to experience most of the rural, coastal plain's habitats in one place coexisting with agriculture successfully. Interpretive panels along the Farm to Bay Trail tell the story of Delmarva's key ecosystems and species.In the fall of 2022, Pickering Creek received a grant from the Rural Maryland Council to support creation of new messaging and new artwork for nine interpretive panels. People visit places like Pickering Creek Audubon Center to learn, explore, find adventure, relax and exercise.Interpretive panels help give meaning to the visitors experience by telling the story of the land: past, present and future. Interpretive panels help draw connections between habitats, plants, wildlife and people.The panels highlight the key habitats along the Center's Farm to Bay Trail, which include forest, wetland, meadow, agriculture and brackish water creek. Through the panels we tell the story of key habitat features, flora and fauna through both concise written messages and compelling visuals. Panels help the visitor understand the interconnected nature of land and water on Delmarva.The panels replace aging panels that have been weathered by the sun and rain. None of the existing panels were replicated, so each of the nine panels shares a brand new story about the center, its wildlife and habitats. In addition to replacing existing panels, the new panels fill in spots along the trails that have not been previously highlighted.Over the course of the past year, center staff researched, designed, contracted fabrication and installed nine interpretive panels. At the Center's entrance parking area you will now be greeted by a timeline history of the center that explains its donation and evolution over time.New panels along the Farm to Bay Trail highlight songbirds in the woods, no till agriculture, the importance of forested buffers between land and water, fungi of the woods and birds seen on the creek.New panels along the Wetland and Meadow Trails highlight which amphibians you are likely to see and hear, the importance of milkweed in meadow communities, and bluebird boxes and their benefits.\"Pickering Creek is unique as a nature center in that we are also agricultural landowners. As the Olds Family who donated the center's core property wished we continued to highlight agriculture as part of the landscape on Delmarva while also sharing how conservation practices coexist with great habitat for wildlife,\" said Center Director Mark Scallion.Pickering Creek is open to the public daily during daylight hours. Check the center website for exact open times as evening daylight gets shorter this fall.There are several viewing platforms and blinds along the way for you to enjoy scenery and wildlife.Benches for resting are spread throughout the trails. The new panels join seven existing panels that have been installed in the last five years in both wetland and meadow habitats.Together they share the story of outdoor habitats and ecosystems and the creatures we share them with on Delmarva. \n \n Caption: Keep an eye out for mushrooms growing high on trees!\n \nSpecies like this Dryad Saddle (right) or Cracked Cap Polypore (above) can grow dozens of feet off the ground on standing snags.\n \n\"There is Fungus Among Us\" is one of the new interpretive panels.\n \nSome species of fungus grow directly in the ground. These species, like this Russula species (above), are seeking nutrients like nitrogen that are already in the soil and therefore don't need to grow on wood.\n \nLook around our forests and you'll find some kind of mushroom. Coming in all colors of the rainbow, most mushrooms are easy to see but they are only the fruiting body of the fungus or mycelium. Mycelium, which look like thin roots or strands of hair, help to break down organic material like leaves and wood for food which recycles the nutrients back into the soil for other plants!\n \nCheck fallen logs for mushrooms. Many mushrooms like the False Turkey Tails (right top) and Bonnet species (right below) can only grow out of dead wood so fallen logs and branches are crucial! \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He has been leading the university's commitment to unbiased scientific research and public service while developing the next generation of environmental scientists since 2017.\"The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science is a very special community within a unique institution driven by a common mission driven by truly exceptional researchers and staff,\" Goodwin said. \"It has been the honor of a lifetime to lead UMCES toward its second century of impact in Maryland and around the world.\"An internationally known expert in ecosystem restoration, he has championed bringing together the best available science around issues of coastal resilience, oyster recovery, ecosystem management, and using large-scale environmental data in decision-making to Maryland. As part of UMCES' longtime role to advise the state on Chesapeake Bay management and restoration programs, he has served an integral role on the Governor's Chesapeake Bay Cabinet, as well as lead science advisor on the Maryland Commission on Climate Change. He has been a consistent leading voice associated with expanding Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives not only within UMCES but throughout the environmental sciences.\"President Goodwin's leadership of UMCES has been vitally important to the state and to the nation, as the science coming out of his institution guides the approach to our shared environmental and climate challenges,\" said University System of Maryland Chancellor Jay A. Perman. \"President Goodwin's compelling vision for UMCES, his skill in developing the next generation of talented and diverse environmental scientists, his well-earned influence in Annapolis, which advances better policy and practice - all of it will be greatly missed. I thank him for the exceptionally strong foundation he's laid for UMCES' dynamic future.\"A globally eminent research institution aimed at advancing scientific knowledge of the environment, UMCES has a unique mandate from the state of Maryland to conduct scientific research and provide sound advice to help leaders manage Maryland's natural resources. Since its establishment in 1925, UMCES has played a key role in expanding our understanding of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem and is known for tracking progress on its restoration.UMCES addresses some of the most pressing environmental challenges facing society nationally and internationally and prepares future scientists to meet the global challenges of the 21st century through the Marine Estuarine and Environmental Sciences (MEES) graduate program, as well as other educational offerings.\"On behalf of the Board of Visitors, we have greatly enjoyed working with Peter to advance UMCES these years. He has moved this institution forward in so many ways,\" said outgoing Board of Visitors Chair Charlie Monk. \"Thank you for giving us the opportunity to share our ideas and support your vision for this unique institution.\"Perman has appointed longtime UMCES Vice President Bill Dennison as interim president, effective Sept. 25. He will serve in that capacity until a permanent replacement is named by the Search and Screening Committee appointed by the USM for the UMCES, one of the university system's 12 institutions. \n \n Caption: AMY PELSINSKY/UNIVERSITY OF MARY LAND CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE\n \nUniversity of Maryland Center for Environmental Science President Peter Goodwin retires after 40 years in science and higher education. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lawrence Wetlands Preserve officially opens in Chestertown\n\n October 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Laura Tayman | Page: 12 | Section: News \n \n 681\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN - It took the efforts of county, state, and federal governments to make Michael Lawrence's dream of children learning in the outdoors a reality. The Sultana Education Foundation held a ribbon cutting ceremony for its new Lawrence Wetlands Preserve this week.Drew McMullen, President of the Sultana Education Foundation located in Chestertown, said the educational programs provided by the foundation show how the Chesapeake Bay includes wetlands, shoreline, and now the watershed. \"We can now show the connection between land and water,\" he said.Under development since 2017, the Lawrence Wetlands Preserve is an 8.5-acre urban nature center that features a variety of ecosystems including upland forest, swamp, marsh, shrublands, meadows, and a freshwater pond. In addition to its natural elements, the property boasts an accessible trail network, wetland boardwalk, viewing platforms, an activity field, and the 1,200-square-foot Harwood Nature Center.The land was purchased from Washington College in 2017.McMullen told the ribbon-cutting guests that already the foundation has provided over 200,000 students from the Eastern Shore and 15 other counties hands-on lessons, \"now that the center is open new programs start next week.\" Joining the ribbon cutting team were state Senator Stephen Hershey, state Delegate Jay Jacobs, National Park Service Planning and Development Manager Bob Campbell, Chestertown Councilman Albert Nickerson, and Kent County Superintendent of Schools Dr. Karen Couch.Jacobs, a Kent County resident, took a tour of the area before the project began. \"I've seen the before and after, and it's remarkable\" he said. As for funding they received from the state, Jacobs said, \"It speaks to the credibility of the Sultana foundation that they were able to get that kind of funding level - when you get what you want when you want it.\" \"We are grateful to Mr.Lawrence and the individuals, foundations, and government agencies that made the creation of the Preserve possible,\" commented Sultana Board Chair Robert Hindman. \"We're thrilled to have created a resource that will enhance the Foundation's environmental education programs while serving as a green space for the entire community.\" Several state and federal agencies awarded sizable grants to the project including the Maryland General Assembly, the National Park Service, Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, the Maryland Heritage Areas Authority, the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, and the Stories of the Chesapeake Heritage Area.The Lawrence Wetlands Preserve will host environmental literacy programs and professional development opportunities for 3,000 students and teachers annually, with a focus on PreK through fifth grade. The Preserve will often be used in conjunction with activities taking place at other locations on Sultana's Chestertown campus, including its LEED Platinum Holt Education Center, the schooner SULTANA, and canoe and kayak trips based out of Wilmer Park.When not in use for programs, the Preserve will serve as a contact point for the National Park Service's Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, host programs for the public, and be open for general visitation daily from dusk to dawn.Kent County Superintendent Dr. Karen Couch said McMullen was one of the first people she met when she came to the county. \"I found we weren't accessing the foundation like we should. Together we worked diligently to provide students valuable lessons to become good environmental stewards,\" said Couch.All KCPS students from pre-k through grade eight have had at least one activity with the foundation. Using the Maryland state science standards, plans are for all first grades to visit and study bird adaptations; for all third graders to student pond ecology, and all eighth graders to study soil and water chemistry.\"This is hands-on learning by doing,\" said Couch. These lessons will stay with them the rest of their lives.\" Said Hershey, \"It's important that students learn how things work outside of the classroom. A lot of us would have loved to get these opportunities when we were young.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nState Delegate Jay Jacobs, State Senator Stephen Hershey, Kent County Schools Superintendent Dr. Karen Couch, Kent County Commissioner Albert Nickerson, National Park Service Planning and Development Manager Bob Campbell, and Drew McMullen, president of the Sultana Education Foundation cut the ribbon to open the Lawrence Wetlands Preserve in Chestertown. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Officials tout Bay education and funding bill\n\n October 19, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Shifra Dayak; Capital News Service | Page: A4 | Section: News \n \n 603\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - A House panel held a hearing Wednesday on a bill that would boost Chesapeake Bay restoration and environmental education programs.The Chesapeake Bay Science, Education, and Ecosystem Enhancement Act of2023, sponsored by Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, would reauthorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Chesapeake Bay office for the first time since 2006.Congress has appropriated funds to the NOAA office each year, but an official reauthorization would allow the office to more efficiently carry out Chesapeake Bay restoration and monitoring initiatives, Sarbanes told the House Natural Resources Committee's water, wildlife and fisheries subcommittee.\"In recent decades, the health of the Chesapeake Bay has been negatively affected by nutrient runoff across the watershed, disappearing coastal and marine habitats and many other factors,\" Sarbanes said. \"That makes the passage of the Chesapeake Bay SEEE act all the more important.\"The bill would also enhance NOAA's interpretive buoy system, which collects data on water quality, weather patterns and more; enhance NOAA's aquaculture programs that aim to support marine habitats and workers in the seafood industry; and finance grants for hands-on environmental education in kindergarten through 12th grade classrooms in the region.This bill, introduced in the summer, \"could not come at a more critical time,\" according to Allison Colden, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's executive director.\"There's still much work to be done,\" Colden said. \"To achieve meaningful and lasting restoration we need all of our federal partners at the table.\"Colden pointed to the NOAA Chesapeake Bay office's positive track record on oyster restoration projects, citing the bill as an avenue to continue such initiatives in the future by ensuring the office has financial stability.NOAA staff are working to restore oysters in 11 tributaries in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and have completed restoration across more than 1,900 acres, according to a tracker by the Chesapeake Bay Program.\"The scale of this work is really unprecedented,\" Carrie Selberg Robinson, the director of NOAA's habitat conservation office, said of the oyster conservation efforts. \"We want to continue to build upon our successes that we've had and continue this great work of oyster restoration into the future.\"Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Virginia, who co-sponsored the bill, also praised its potential impact on furthering oyster restoration projects.\"Large scale oyster restoration is really Mother Nature's filter in taking a lot of stuff out of the bay that would otherwise take years and years to do,\" Wittman said.The Chesapeake Bay SEEE Act comes amid other efforts this congressional session to restore the health of the nation's largest estuary.Sarbanes also sponsored a bill that would designate the bay as a national recreation area under the National Park Service. Wittman sponsored a bill that would fund conservation initiatives in the watershed, such as a pilot project to plant riparian buffers.The latest Sarbanes-Wittman bill includes provisions to instill stewardship values into students, allowing for bay restoration to continue in the longterm, witnesses told the subcommittee. If passed, the bill would continue to fund NOAA's Chesapeake Bay-Watershed Education and Training Program, which provides grants for environmental education in the watershed.Witnesses faced slight pushback on the the bill from Rep. Cliff Bentz, R-Ore-gon - the ranking member of the subcommittee - who called for supporters to provide more specific metrics about the benefits of environmental education.Colden said that the Chesapeake Bay Foundation will provide the subcommittee with numbers ahead of further movement on the bill, but added that the positives of teaching children about caring for the bay are evident.\"We're building the workforce that can continue the work of Chesapeake Bay restoration,\" Colden said. \"It's so incredibly important to make that investment in our next generation of bay stewards.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some animals respond and some don't. Right now, it's a question that nobody seems to have a complete answer to.\"\nThe Texas A&M researcher said animals at a zoo in South Carolina showed varying reactions to an eclipse in 2017 \u2014 including some that began nighttime preparations, some that looked to the sky and others who displayed signs of anxiety or unusual activities.\n\"Researchers saw giraffes suddenly start running around their pen,\" Dykes said. \"Some of the male gorillas became more aggressive. These were some of the anxiety behaviors.\"\n\"For birds, they would suddenly go to nest and then a few minutes later, when the sun came back out, they would seem to start their day all over again,\" he said. \"There's no telling what's running through these critters' minds when, suddenly midday, the sky goes dark. Their environment is always having an influence, whether through rain, temperature, wind speed, the amount of sunlight or the length of day. Wildlife are deeply in tune with their surroundings.\"\nResearchers from other universities as well as students and teachers from high schools will also be studying animal and wildlife behaviors.\nThat includes a contingent from North Carolina State University who will be part of a research effort at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas during the April 8 eclipse.\nAdam Hartstone-Rose, a biology professor at North Carolina State, was also at the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden in Columbia, South Carolina in 2017.\nHe's excited for the 2024 total solar eclipse to see how animals react.\nThe researchers welcome input from others who see how farm animals, dogs and cats and other wildlife react during the cosmic happening.\n\"We're interested not only in figuring out which animals react to the eclipse and how, but (to) what extent of totality is necessary to cause a reaction,\" Hartsone-Rose said.\n\"We're really excited about getting data from people that might be at farms or cattle ranches,\" he said. \"We're hoping that people will go out into the woods and see what squirrels, deer and birds are doing. And I'm really excited about people just observing their pets in their backyard.\"\nThe eclipse will be visible to varying degrees across the U.S. with a path of totality where the moon will completely darken the sun for three to four minutes stretching from Texas and Oklahoma and into Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, upstate New York and New England.\nOvercast conditions and stormy weather could impact how visible the eclipse is in parts of the country \u2014 including Texas and Ohio.\nIt will be the biggest eclipse in the U.S. since 1806 and there will not be another similar event until 2044.\nZoos \u2014 especially those in or near the totality path of the eclipse \u2014 will also be hosting special events for visitors Monday. That includes ones in Indianapolis, Toledo, Ohio, St. Louis and throughout Texas.\nThe eclipse comes after a 4.8 magnitude earthquake hit Friday in New Jersey near New York City. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For the Washington College Campus Garden Club that's not just a seasonal thing.They, and residents interested in sustainable living practices, gathered together for a monthly potluck dinner April 12 \u2014 a Permaculture Potluck, this time held at the community garden on campus.\nPresident of the club, Jo Perkins described permaculture as a, \"smash of two words, permanent and agriculture.\"\nShe explained, \"It's essentially a set of 12 design principles and three fundamental ethics: earth share, people care and fair share. It's a way to design your systems to be good for humans and for the environment simultaneously.\"\nFor member, Justinian Dispenza, permaculture is a way to get back to our growing roots.\n\"Let's get our feet in the dirt. Eat local and help heal. Everyone is capable of fixing where they're at.\"\nThe space itself is a good indicator of this lifestyle in practice.\nSince its early roots in 2012, when students put in some vegetable beds and trees, the club has grown significantly. The space now has a fenced area with a coop of happy chickens, a renovated pond, a bridge over a little waterfall, a mud pizza oven (primitive earth oven), a beehive, an insect hotel (for pollination purposes) some fruit trees, some buckthorn trees, and some compost piles.\nThis all lies beyond the painted wall on campus. A surreal area, especially surrounded by brick dorm buildings and cars chugging by.\nPerkins said, \"It's really impressive how far the space has come.\"\nShe pointed to her first project she started, over the fence where a scarecrow in Perkin's clothes is humorously referred to as 'The Scare-Jo,\" towards the chickens.\nThere are eight chickens in total, among them Black Jersey Giants, a Leghorn, some Easter Eggers, a Rhode Island Red and a Favorolle.\nAs nature teaches lessons, Perkins described permaculture at work inside the coop.\nShe said that chickens eat bugs which have nutrients, then chicken manure fertilizes the fruit trees, then the chickens eat some of the apples that grow, becoming a catalyst for compost and finally humans eat the nutritious eggs.\nEverything in nature harmonizes.\nShane Brill the permaculture educator at Washington College called it applied common sense.\nHe's been introducing these concepts to his classmates and the've been acting on them, which has produced incredible results.\nThe growing principles and rural way of life is something that Kent County and Eastern Shore residents know about already, so the club hopes to keep good camaraderie with the public.\nBased on the laughter and fellowship it's effective.\nDispenza, who takes the lead in the potlucks, said they always start with people introducing themselves and their field of interest.\nFor example, he said, one could say 'I'm a bee keeper,' and from there, the crowd would learn about another facet of sustainable living.\nAs it stands, the garden has plenty of green space for people to congregate, and they're building a new addition, a section for poetry, for classroom instruction and planning events.\n\"There's a lot of potential for things to come in and do a lot of cool things,\" Perkins commented.\nDispenza and company are always working on more activities for community engagement. They have master gardeners come in, and community events as well as volunteer with the Chestertown Garden Club on various projects.\nBut they are always looking for more people with knowledge on growing, planting, building, producing, harvesting, foraging, or anything else like that.\nDispenza said if anyone is interested in hosting a permaculture potluck, he encouraged them to reach out. He stressed the importance of going to different places in the county to learn, since no two areas are alike.\n\"There's a lot of great people in Kent County and Eastern Shore Community that know about sustainability. I'm here to learn,\" Dispenza said.\nThe next potluck is May 5, at 6 p.m. at Kentmore Park.\nPeople can check out www.facebook.com/espigrow or email espigrow@gmail.com for more details. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I would also like to thank our wonderful Conservation Corps Team and everyone in the Maryland Park Service who helped support our corps members.\"\nMaryland Conservation Corps members come from across the country, are between the ages of 17 and 25, and complete at least 1,700 hours of service.\nThis year's corps class improved more than 2,400 acres of parks and public lands; planted more than 9,963 native trees, bay grasses and plants; treated more than 7,902 trees against harmful insects and diseases; and taught environmental education programs to more than 23,750 students, youth and park visitors.\nThe program offers hands-on, real-world experience in a team-based environment in subjects ranging from aquatic systems to public lands management.\nMany alumni of the program have gone on to conservation careers with organizations including the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the National Aquarium, the United States Geological Survey and others.\nThe Maryland Conservation Corps, an award-winning AmeriCorps program, has been managed by the Maryland Park Service since 1984. The Park Service is now accepting applications for the next class, which begins in the fall.\nMore information and applications for the Maryland Conservation Corps can be found on the DNR website. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Currently, the lab is working with the city on a flood mitigation project along the Choptank River.\nGetting to community engagement, Sieracki brought up what Horn Point already does to connect with the Cambridge and Dorchester County community. Along with the flood mitigation project, he mentioned the school's weekly Tuesday lab tours, its annual open house in October and the science talks it hosts. He also talked about student internships, K-12 programming and a summer camp the lab hosts called Toadfish Adventures.\nIn looking at where community engagement could expand, Sieracki brought up ideas of supporting local oyster aquaculture and expanding the number of internships and K-12 student programming available. He also mentioned workforce development.\n\"And I want to just challenge you to talk with us about new ideas or directions that we could go that would impact our town,\" he said to the commissioners at the meeting. \"I'm a citizen and resident of the City of Cambridge, so I'm interested in what happens here.\"\nAfter his presentation to the council, Commissioner Shay Lewis-Sisco talked about her experience working with Horn Point as a Dorchester County Public Schools employee. She said the district has a student apprenticing at Horn Point this year and she would love to expand those opportunities.\nCommissioner Brett Summers talked about an idea to promote tourism through oysters in a partnership with a variety of players, like Horn Point, ShoreRivers and the Richardson Maritime Museum.\n\"Perhaps creating some kind of destination where you get to enjoy oysters, learn about what Horn Point's doing and just the history of our area,\" he said.\nSummers said the city could help develop this potential \"oyster trail.\"\n\"And I'm interested,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Tickets are $75 per person.\nLocal humane societies are not directly attached to the National Humane Society, making the Humane Society of Charles County 100% reliant on local donations, grants and fundraising, Rayanne Benya, president of the board of directors for the Humane Society of Charles County, said.\nIn 1975, the humane society did not have a building. Instead, people who found an injured animal had to take them home, Anne Gardiner, founder of the Humane Society of Charles County, said. In 1981, the St. Charles County Association of Realtors gave the humane society the land for a shelter and it opened in 1983.\n\"It was tough getting started,\" Gardiner said. \"One time I had [animals] in all three bathrooms and we were wondering what we were going to do.\"\nThe humane society has three sections: the kennel, which houses animals ranging from dogs and cats to guinea pigs, rabbits, lizards, turtles and snakes; the humane education program, which teaches students about animals and environmental science; and the clinic.\n\"Fifty years later, we're still here,\" Benya said. \"We're here because we're supported by the residents of the county \u2026 and I think that's something to celebrate.\"\nThe gala will have a silent auction with dog baskets, Gardiner said. Other baskets will have household items. Wine and alcohol will be raffled, and there will also be gift cards for restaurants and businesses.\nLive music will be performed by the \"Original\" Moonlighters and there will be a lipsologist \u2014 a person who \"reads\" lip prints \u2014 and a cash bar. Food is being donated by the Waldorf Jaycees.\n\"It's just for a great cause,\" Benya said. \"We adopt out anywhere from one to 2,000 animals a year and all those animals need medical care.\"\nUnder the shelter's care, the humane society often has about 150 animals, an amount that can go up to 250 animals during the summer, Benya said.\nThroughout the year, the shelter has around 200 volunteers who help with adoption events, laundry and being around the animals. They also want to build an animal medical facility for emergencies and a larger surgery wing.\n\"When [people] come here and they volunteer, they see the connection \u2026 between humans and animals,\" Benya said.\nThe humane society is holding its annual photo contest until Sept. 27, Benya said. People can send a cute photo of their pet that can be featured in a calendar.\nOn Sept. 20, they will have an adoption event at the humane society, Benya said.\nThe nonprofit also has a program called Freedom Friends year round that offers discounts to veterans to adopt animals for animals that have been in the shelter for six months or longer.\n\"It's important that we receive the funding \u2026 so we can continue to be here for the county,\" Benya said. \"If we disappear, that's going to be devastating for the animal population.\nFor more information about the Oct. 10 gala or to purchase tickets, go to humanesocietycc.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One of the issues that came up during conversations with farmers in Southern Maryland was invasive plant species.\nNurture Natives was created to address this agricultural issue and the broader environmental issue of invasive species.\nThese sustainable efforts helped the National 4-H Council select her as one of the 2026 4-H Youth in Action Award winners. Nurture Natives has planted 2.4 million native seeds, distributed 70,000 seedlings and engaged more than 10,000 young people to help protect native plants and pollinators, according to a release from 4-H.\n\"Pollination is what keeps our world functioning,\" Bonney said. \"Pollination is so key to both our agriculture and our environmental systems.\"\nJeremy Tidd, owner and founder of Bona Terra, looked for ways to give back to the community and get more engagement about his native plant nursery when he decided to start giving seedlings away for free as part of a grant application, he said. Bona Terra grows 30 native plant species and is working to give away one million seedlings a year.\n\"There's no shortage of seeds in the world,\" Tidd said.\nBona Terra became involved with Nurture Native's mission when Bonney called local nurseries to put pamphlets on display racks, Tidd said. Bona Terra invited Nurture Natives to the nursery.\n\"They saw that I was giving away seedlings and they wanted to volunteer,\" Tidd said.\nBona Terra and Nurture Natives partnered to decide how to run seedling giveaway events and what training sessions to offer, Tidd said. They had their first training in March.\n\"Every time the world changes it's because we've taught the next generation,\" Tidd said. \"Young adults \u2026 were taught \u2026 that we had to do something about it and now it's just accepted, common knowledge.\"\nNurture Natives is at the intersection of environmental stewardship and youth mental health, Bonney said. The organization is meant to help young people find meaning through environmental action who feel disconnected from nature or who feel powerless when hearing about the biodiversity crises.\n\"You might notice a lot of people who have a passion for gardening are older,\" Bonney said. \"A discussion that has been pretty consistent \u2026 has been how do we bridge this gap?\"\nBonney is a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park and hopes to continue to grow Nurture Natives as a fellow with the university's Do Good Institute, where she will work on expanding the nonprofit's initiatives, she said.\n\"The coolest thing about the seedlings is it has made people brave,\" Tidd said. \"This is a learning opportunity. Plants are amazing and have so much to teach us.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

My family and I live on a farm, and my son loves to spend a lot of time with our pigs, cows and goats. He loves taking care of them every day because they are his pride and joy. As a result of this, he and his clothes often end up having a distinct scent on them from the animals. He tries to get it off of him, but it sticks.I am offended and upset that someone wouldn't have the guts to tell me to my face. Instead, they chose to leave a note without signing their name. I now feel as if I can't trust the people around me anymore, and I feel as if it could've been anyone from my life.How am I supposed to find out who did this and confront them? - My Son's Hygiene DEAR MY SON's HYGIENE: I'm sorry, but I think you are looking at this through the wrong lens. It isn't that the person lacks courage. I believe the message was delivered anonymously so that you can seriously address this situation rather than get in a rage over the messenger.Stop trying to figure out who wrote it. Start getting creative on helping your teen son learn how to take better care of his body and clothing as he continues to love his animals. Ask some of your male farmer friends what they recommend for cleanliness. This is not a new problem for farmers. Somebody should have solutions you can try.Forgive the messenger, and receive the message.Harriette Cole is a life stylist and founder of DREAMLEAPERS, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

MICHAELS-Nine middle school students gained lifesaving skills Wednesday afternoon, thanks to a partnership between the St. Michaels Community Center, St. Michaels Youth & Law Enforcement (SMYLE), Talbot County Emergency Services and the Perkins Family YMCA.Talbot County paramedic Rachael Cox led the afterschool CPR and AED training class at the Y, guiding the young students through the steps to take in an emergency.The class was free for all who participated, thanks to a $200 donation from SMYLE, the St. Michaels Police Department's youth program, that covered certification costs for the students. The St. Michaels Community Center assisted in facilitating the program.Cox began her class by showing how to check if a person is responsive, then asked the students what they thought the next step was.The answer? Calling 911 and staying on the line with the dispatcher.The next step, as Cox demonstrated, is checking if the person is breathing. If not, it's time to start chest compressions, she said.Each student practiced chest compressions on practice manikins and learned how to use an AED before moving on to learning how to do CPR on infants.As a community risk reduction paramedic and CPR and AED coordinator for Talbot County, Cox loves teaching. She likes being able to introduce preteens and teenagers to CPR, first aid and AED skills to prepare them for any emergency situation, even if they're alone without adults present.\"I feel like we call EMS, police, fire and dispatch first responders, but I really don't believe we're first responders because we're not there when the emergency happens-the community is,\" she said. \"And that's why I feel these types of classes are so important.\"Amethyst Monroe, a Perkins Family YMCA staffer who supervised Wednesday's class, is continuing to coordinate other developing middle school programs. She's planning another CPR and AED session soon.Monroe's aim is to make sure future programs are lowcost and provide the area's youth with more life skills.Anyone who wishes to support future after-school programming at the Perkins Family YMCA can donate to the center's annual campaign or reach out to Tracy Eutsler, the Y's executive director, at teutsler@ymcachesapeake.org.Those who are interested in scheduling CPR and AED classes can contact Rachael Cox at rcox@talbotdes.org. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTalbot County paramedic Rachael Cox demonstrates how to use AED chest pads on a practice manikin.\n \nNATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTwo young girls team up to save the life of their practice manikin.

It seems like everything comes so easily to her, and it's hard for me not to compare our paths.Recently, my friend received a $10,000 scholarship for a study abroad program in Japan and landed an internship at one of the top investment banking firms in the United States. She applied to only one internship and only one scholarship, and things fell into place effortlessly. It's as if a fairy comes in every night while she's sleeping and throws magic pixie dust at her to make everything work out. Meanwhile, I feel like I have to fight tooth and nail just to make half as much progress. Every day is a continuous struggle to accomplish the goals that I have. I try hard to be positive, but obstacles pop up constantly. How can I deal with these feelings of envy and move forward with a more upbeat outlook on life? - Jealous DEAR JEALOUS: It is understandable that you would be envious of your friend for what appears to be an easy life. As you also know, it is toxic to dwell on what other people have. No good will come out of that longing. Instead, you must focus on yourself. Do your best to view your life as your perfect challenge. You are gaining resilience as you live through each experience.Claim your small victories.To keep on track, create a vision board. Look through magazines and newspapers for images that reflect the things you want for your life. Cut them out. Brainstorm words and ideas that represent your dreams.Write them down. Next, on a large piece of cardboard or paper, place the images and words together. Make a simple art piece out of this collection of ideas to create your vision board. When thoughts creep in about your friend's success - or anyone else's - wish them well and pivot back to planning your own life. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Health department recommends making condoms available at local high school\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LAURA TAYMAN | Section: News \n \n 643\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last month, Kent County Board of Education members were provided stark facts about the rise in sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in the community, the state, and the country at its recent monthly meeting.Ashley Minietta, communicable disease and family planning contact for the Kent County Department of Health, made a presentation to the board before the holiday break, saying the solution to reversing the trend is \"to provide ground support, monitor trends, and turn data into action.\"\n\"While 20% of Marylanders have an STD, almost half of the cases are ages 15-24,\" Minietta said, citing the 2020 U.S. census map \u2014 putting Maryland in the South region of the country, \"It's one of the highest rates in the region.\"\nMinietta said the barriers to effectively preventing both STDs and teenage pregnancies in Kent County are lack of education, the cost of birth control, parental resistance to alternatives, lack of public transportation, the geographic barriers of the rural area and lack of health care options.\nTeen pregnancy rates are down, Minietta said, because parents have been proactive with putting teenage daughters on birth control. But pills and IUDs do not allow the prevention of STDs that can lead to long-term health consequences.\n\"Research in 2020 shows only 9% of sexually active high school students used a condom,\" Minetta said. \"That has only increased.\"\nMinetta shared various ways local school systems are providing a condom availability program to meet the needs of their high school students, including those in Queen Anne's, Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot and Wicomico counties, and counties on the western shore.\nWhile some have availability through the school's nurse's office, others provide a \"brown bag\" approach, where students can pick up a paper bag on an anonymous basis.\nBoard member Aretha Dorsey said that as a parent she was concerned that a program like that would encourage secrets among parents and their children.\n\"I feel like parents' rights are being taken away,\" Dorsey said. \"I believe that kids might form a lack of respect for their parents and think they can do things their own way.\"\nBoard member Francois Sullivan said Kent County and its rural location is a valid argument for such a program.\n\"There is a difference between a nurse providing condoms and a cashier.\"\nWhen asked to share her opinion, student board member Madison Messick said she couldn't even remember her sex education class.\n\"I think this is really important,\" she said. \"There is a stigma. We can't go to Walgreens because we know the cashier. I know kids that would definitely benefit from this.\"\nVienna Walker, supervisor of student services for the Board, said she recommended the board adopt a policy where Kent County students can meet with a high school nurse and ask for information and guidance.\nSuperintendent Karen Couch said she had been asked by parents how students could be opted out of a program if they don't approve. Walker said she would need to check with the state's Department of Education to see how that could be handled.\n\"Some students have much more open communication with school nurses than their parents,\" Walker said. \"Their office is much less threatening to students who then become comfortable enough to come back if they are not feeling great.\"\nThat is Walker's goal. She recommended the board consider approving a program that requires students to visit nurses who can provide education and guidance on condom use.\n\"Nurses also encourage students to be open and honest with their parents,\" Walker said.\nMessick agreed.\n\"Students will participate not because kids don't trust their parents,\" she said. \"The program encourages conversations between parents and their children. It's like therapy where they can't tell parents what their child is talking about. This actually helps to form a better relationship between students and parents.\"\nSchool Board President Joe Goetz said he would like for Walker to get information from other districts on how they manage parent objections.\n\"I think real life examples would help,\" Goetz said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gladwin from the University System of Maryland spoke about a new program that would bring medical students to the Eastern Shore, and Sara Rich talked about the growth of the Choptank Community Health System.\nGladwin, who is dean of the University of Maryland School of Medicine and vice president for medical affairs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, talked about the Rural Health Equity and Access Longitudinal elective program.\nOnce in place, he said the program will have students spend their first two years in Baltimore, coming to the Eastern Shore to do rotations. For students' last two years, they will spend four months of each year learning and training on the Eastern Shore.\nThis program will address a need for more health care on the Shore, Gladwin said. The five counties in the state with the fewest primary care physicians per capita are all on the Eastern Shore.\n\"As we all know, there is a pressing need to enhance physician and medical provider services and hospital services for the Eastern Shore,\" he said.\nThis new program is a partnership between the University of Maryland, Baltimore, the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. Between the three partners, Gladwin said $300,000 has been invested to start the program.\nHe said a director, assistant director and administrative support staff have been hired. The estimated cost to support and build the program is about $2.2 million per year, Gladwin said.\n\"We put in a federal grant for the program,\" he said. \"And we think it would be very helpful to get state support for this.\"\nGladwin said they are mainly seeking scholarship support for the program. He said they would like to be able to give out full scholarships to students in the program who agree to staying on the Eastern Shore to work.\n\"We think there's a lot of interest (from) our students in rural health care, in health equity,\" Gladwin said. \"And we think this could be a signature program to attract future doctors.\"\nEastern Shore Delegation Chair Del. Chris Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said he was appreciative of the efforts to get this program going.\n\"It is surely needed,\" he said of the program.\nAlso during the meeting on Friday, Choptank Community Health System CEO Sarah Rich talked about Choptank Community Health's expansions on the Shore.\nCurrently, the health system has seven health centers and 18 school-based health centers across Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties.\nRich said progress on the construction of its new center in Federalsburg is moving along \"very well.\" The health system broke ground on this project in the early summer of 2023.\nThis new center will have five wings for medical, dental and behavioral health services. It will house a rural residency program in partnership with the University of Maryland School of Medicine and University of Maryland Shore Regional Health, as well as a dental residency program.\nRich also talked about Choptank Community Health's expansion into Kent County, which includes a health center in Chestertown and a school-based health center in Rock Hall.\nBehavioral health in schools is another way the health system has expanded.\n\"We know that is a huge need,\" she said. \"So we do have therapists now in Caroline and Talbot counties.\"\nRich said they plan to offer these services to students in Kent County and Queen Anne's County schools next. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Opioid deaths spur push for kids to carry naloxone\n\n March 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SAPNA BANSIL Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1188\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Jackson Taylor remembers when a peer passed out from an overdose across from his high school. He knows friends who have struggled with addiction. One has been in and out of rehab.Those experiences help explain why the Rockville High School senior now trains his peers on how to administer naloxone, a lifesaving medication that reverses opioid overdoses. They're why he carries naloxone at school and why he wants all districts to let their students do the same.\n\"It's just like a student having a heart attack,\" said Taylor, who runs a student task force on drug and opioid issues in Montgomery County. \"It might be rare, but on the off chance it happens, you want to be able to save them and help them.\"\nCurrently, a disparate and ambiguous set of district-level policies has created confusion on the role students may play in preventing opioid deaths among their peers. But a bill before the Maryland General Assembly aims to provide a clear and uniform set of standards.\nThe measure, HB 1268, would explicitly authorize students across the state to possess and administer naloxone \u2014 also known by its brand name, Narcan \u2014 as adolescent opioid deaths surge and teens lobby for urgent solutions.\nWhile the practice is already permitted for students in Montgomery County, others have gotten punished for carrying naloxone in school, according to the bill's sponsor, Del. Joe Vogel (D-Montgomery).\n\"We know that our student populations are uniquely vulnerable when it comes to (the opioid) issue,\" Vogel said. \"And this (bill) is, to me, a common-sense step to say, 'Hey, you should not be punished for carrying naloxone with you in a school hallway, and you should not be punished for saving a classmate's life if they're overdosing.'\"\nAt a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, Taylor, 18, was among those who testified in support of the measure. So, too, did Maryland's Special Secretary of Opioid Response, Emily Keller, an indication that the bill has the backing of Gov. Wes Moore's administration.\n\"Empowering people and giving them the tools necessary to help is a vital strategy, especially with young people,\" Keller said in her testimony. \"Making naloxone accessible with every Marylander is one of our priorities because we know it's the number one life-saving tool.\"\nThe bill responds to an alarming national trend: Between 2018 and 2022, adolescent deaths from opioids quadrupled, according to an analysis by KFF.\nThe rise in overdoses has coincided with two factors, said Patricia Kapunan, the medical director for Montgomery County Public Schools. One is the use of social media to market pills without a prescription. The other is the rise of fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid that is being mixed with illegal drugs, often unbeknownst to the user and with deadly effects.\nIn 2021, fentanyl was involved in nearly four times as many fatal overdoses among young people in Maryland as the next deadliest drug, cocaine, according to the state's Vital Statistics Administration.\n\"Suddenly, (fentanyl) is showing up everywhere, and suddenly one pill can kill,\" Kapunan said.\nImplementation questionsIn response to the opioid crisis, lawmakers have mandated that school districts take preventive actions. The Start Talking Maryland Act of 2017 required public schools to teach kids about the dangers of opioids and have naloxone available on campuses. It also authorized nurses and other health and school personnel to administer the medication in overdose emergencies.\nMost districts have not extended the same permission to students. In Cecil County, students are not necessarily punished for possessing naloxone, according to director of student and school safety John Roush. But \"they would be talked to by their school administration about it and informed that we don't have a policy for (them) to carry that in schools,\" he said.\nRoush thinks the bill is a good idea and may help save lives, though he anticipates challenges with implementation and logistics.\n\"We have over 15,000 kids in our system here,\" he said. \"How do you get Narcan out? How do you get information out? How do you make them educated on the use? How do you make them aware? It seems like there would be a lot of time and details to be worked out in that regard.\"\nWhile the bill requires schools to educate students about the benefits of naloxone, it does not specifically address one major logistical consideration: training kids on how to dispense the medication.\nAvailable over the counter as a nasal spray, Narcan must be administered by tilting the person's head back and firmly pressing the plunger. Because the medication's effects are temporary and overdose symptoms may return, it is critical that the individual providing Narcan also call 911 and seek medical aid.\nTo the American Medical Association, the benefits of expanding naloxone access in schools still outweigh the risks. Following a debate on the issue, the group approved a resolution last year encouraging \"states, communities and educational settings to remove barriers to students carrying safe and effective overdose reversal medications.\"\n\"Narcan saves people quickly, and lack of Narcan kills people quickly,\" said Kenneth Certa, an AMA delegate from the American Psychiatric Association, which co-sponsored the policy. \"When somebody is turning blue and cold, you don't have much time. And to wait until a dose gets from another part of the building can be too late.\"\n'Hugely empowering'In Montgomery County, which saw a 78% spike in youth overdoses from 2021 to 2022, a policy permitting students to carry naloxone took effect on May 1, 2023.\nKapunan, who crafted the measure, said students were never punished for possessing overdose-reversing medications and were already protected under good samaritan laws if they acted in an emergency. But teen advocates nonetheless pressed for a policy change that eliminated ambiguity and codified their right to intervene.\n\"Those levels of permission were really important to students,\" Kapunan said. \"For me, it was a very small part of the regulation. For them, it was hugely empowering.\"\nKapunan says the policy does not mean schools are depending on kids to save lives. During the 2022-23 school year, naloxone was dispensed on school grounds in Montgomery County 18 times, almost always by nurses. Since the policy change, there have been no known instances of a student administering naloxone to a peer at school.\nBut to supporters, the measure remains an important preventive step, permitting those in closest proximity to an overdose to act without fear of repercussion.\n\"Students know before the teachers do, is the truth,\" Taylor said. \"I'm a lot more likely to know, 'Hey, my friend has a pill in his bag that he's thinking about taking, and it could have a repercussion' than a teacher would know.\"\nVogel, who is running for the open U.S. congressional seat in Maryland's 6th District, said expanding policies like the one in Montgomery County has become a necessity. Six months ago, he met with student leaders who spoke to the urgency of the opioid crisis and their desire to help address it.\n\"A lot of them have taken matters into their own hands,\" Vogel said. \"A number of them have stepped up and said, 'We want to get trained on how to administer naloxone, and we want to be able to carry naloxone.' \u2026 That's what this bill is in response to.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "For All Seasons is growing with the Latino community\n\n May 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 802\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 For All Seasons, a behavioral health and rape crisis center serving the Eastern Shore, has had what could be described as a long and continuously adapting relationship with serving the local Latino community.Ivy Garcia, director of Latino services at For All Seasons, said it began in 2006 when she was hired as an interpreter for the nonprofit. Garcia said though the work she was doing at the time was important, the more she talked to the local community, the more she realized that this was just a stepping stone.\nShe moved on to become an advocate, and when word got out that a Latina was advocating for the Latino community, more and more Latino clients began to seek resources.\nGarcia's passion shone through her work as she began to advocate for more and more services, including a Spanish language crisis hotline, staff training, educational groups, and the Latino Program at For All Seasons.\n\"The people started to trust and confide themselves to me,\" Garcia said. \"I started doing education workshops on self-esteem and women empowerment. I also bring in guest speakers like Planned Parenthood and the Department of Health, and we eat food together and discuss topics they may have questions about.\"\nToday, For All Seasons has established a Latino Program to help serve the many needs of the local Latino community. This program provides bilingual education and outreach initiatives for communities throughout the Mid-Shore region.\nThe services provided range from support groups, case management, advocacy and referrals to local resources. Garcia leads a support group for Latinas on Mondays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., where she listens to the needs of women and finds ways to assist their ever-changing needs.\nBeth Anne Dorman, president and CEO of For All Seasons, said it's important for people to understand that the Hispanic community in Talbot County is growing. Currently, 15% of the clients For All Seasons serves are Spanish-speaking, and Dorman said they are preparing for those numbers to continue to climb.\nEducation has been the staple of expanding mental health services for the Latino community. Garcia said that mental health is seen as taboo to many Latinos and carries a stigma of being associated with \"crazy.\" For Garcia, it's essential to explain to clients that mental health should be taken as seriously as physical health.\nHowever, education does not stop with clients. Garcia and Dorman have made a point of educating both community members and staff on culturally relevant information in order to better serve the Latino population.\nThe entire agency team receives cultural education so that when Spanish-speaking community members come in, all staff can better understand ways to assist and accommodate expected needs.\nAlongside the education the staff receives, Dorman said For All Seasons has also created a safe environment where staff can ask questions if they have questions pertaining to cultural differences that may arise.\nGarcia said that because many of their Latino clients are undereducated about health, especially mental health, it's important for staff to put in extra work to help assist them and meet them where they are. However, what she keeps at the forefront of her work is admiration for her clients.\nMany of her clients are migrants who have left behind friends, parents and children to come to the United States to work to send money back to their loved ones. Still, when they journey to the United States, they will often go through intense trauma and may not know the tools to navigate their new reality.\n\"It's important to sit down with clients and tell them that though I may not be in your shoes, I see you and admire you for doing that,\" Garcia said.\n\"Because to leave your family is not easy, but you are doing it for love and because you didn't have another option,\" Garcia said. \"It's a passion that I have for this community that I don't think I will ever lose in my lifetime.\"\nDorman said one of the moments that made her feel that the Latino Program was working was two years ago when they hosted a backpack giveaway in the nonprofit's parking lot.\n\"I'm not joking with you. They were lined up down the street, and we were their safe place to land,\" Dorman said. \"When you think about the trauma that these families have experienced, you think about being in a space where they know nothing, they know no one, and they are coming here for them to show up in the parking lot of For All Seasons during the backpack giveaway, and be able to know that there's a place for them to be served.\n\"And that they're a part of our community and they are a part of something. To me, that's the moment that I think just really sort of says it all about who we have become for the Latino community and Talbot County.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It started in California and now operates in 15 states.\nSchool nurses perform an initial vision screening on students and, on average, approximately one-third are referred for an eye exam by an optometrist.\nVision to Learn comes to the school and performs eye exams in a specially outfitted van. Kids who need glasses get to pick out their frames, and the nonprofit returns to deliver the glasses about a month later.\nOver the past decade, Vision to Learn has performed 20,000 eye exams in Delaware and provided 15,000 pairs of glasses \u2013 all free of charge. The effort is funded by donations, as well as billing Medicaid.\nAt Keene, County Executive Matt Meyer presented Vision to Learn with $100,000 from the county's share of the American Rescue Plan Act, enough to provide glasses to nearly 700 more kids.\nAnn Hollister, CEO of Vision to Learn, said it never gets old seeing kids receive their glasses.\n\"It's a little aha moment. So often kids tell us they didn't know the world looked like this,\" Hollister said. \"It's a special moment when they realize, 'Oh, I can see better.'\"\nOften, she added, parents don't realize their kids are struggling with their eyesight.\n\"If a child has a tummy ache, they might go home and tell a parent. But they don't know they can't see,\" Hollister said. \"At a young age, they just think that's what the world looks like.\"\nWhile school nurses have done vision screening for years, having Vision to Learn come to the school to do eye exams and fit kids for glasses is a huge convenience for parents, Taraboletti said.\n\"It's not even just the free glasses,\" she said. \"You don't have to take off work to go to the eye doctor, you don't have to then go back and pick up the glasses. People are busy, and it just makes it so much easier.\"\nBeing able to see properly helps kids do better in school, Hollister said.\n\"Studies show that it makes a profound difference in academic outcomes,\" she said. \"It's one of the most impactful interventions you can provide a child. Everything else works better if you can see.\"\nChristina School District Superintendent Dan Shelton concurred.\n\"A lot of times when we talk about accessibility, we talk about accessibility by access to programs and access to services and access to courses,\" Shelton said. \"But none of that stuff is very helpful if you can't see it.\"\nKeene fourth-grader David Pierre has worn glasses for a few years but was happy to receive a new pair with an updated prescription.\n\"All my other ones have scratches,\" Pierre said.\nAiden Onfroy, also a fourth-grader, was happy to have a new pair of glasses.\n\"The first pair of glasses I got, I still wore them but every couple seconds, I kept on squinting,\" Onfroy said. \"I can see way better.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Escape the Vape Youth Summit held at Chesapeake College\n\n May 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ERIC SYLVIA Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Life \n \n 672\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS \u2014 On a rainy Saturday, approximately 35 students from area schools gathered at Chesapeake College for an event called Escape the Vape, a youth summit.The kids ranged in age from sixth grade to high school and chose to participate in an event designed to empower youth to embrace a vape-free and smoke-free lifestyle. Those attending came from Dorchester, Kent, Talbot and Queen Anne's counties.\nThe program was spearheaded by Dorine Fasset of Queen Anne's County Department of Health, Prevention Services and her colleague Anna Ashley. In addition to the Department of Health, this event had support from Citizens Against Smoking Tobacco Coalition and Chesapeake College Office of Student Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.\nThe program is made available through a grant from Kent County Health Department and Maryland Department of Health.\nAccording to the latest available data from the 2021-2022 school year, over one in four high school students within the five-county Mid-Shore region are current tobacco users. This epidemic is largely driven by the use of electronic smoking devices, e-cigs, or vapes, which have been heavily marketed to teens.\nThe summit featured rap and dance performances aimed at promoting a passion for healthy choices and encouraging young people to reject harmful habits. Special guest Sterlen Barr, CEO of Rapping About Prevention, hoped to inspire attendees with his message of positivity and resilience.\nDr. LaMarr Shields of Baltimore's Cambio Group led the morning session with his son Mosiah by his side. An inspirational speaker, educator, thought-leader, author and artist, Shields creates with purpose in all aspects of his professional and personal life using the common thread of Ubuntu philosophy: a person is a person through other people.\nAn Open Society Institute Fellow and a former faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Education, Shields is co-founder and senior director of education and innovation at the Cambio Group. Shields dedicates his life to inspiring adults and youth alike to pursue a higher purpose, achieve sustainable value for long-term success, and cope with adversity in order to create opportunities in their personal, professional and spiritual lives.\nFurther inspiration was provided through the music and dance of Barr, aka NoPuffDaddy, delivering a high-energy performance using facts, humor, personal experience, teamwork exercises and audience participation. Rapping About Prevention teaches the importance of maintaining a positive, drug-free, safe, healthy and active lifestyle all while having an amazing and memorable experience.\nBarr's own journey began in Philly over 30 years ago when he lost his grandmother to lung cancer. He began writing and rapping as a way to work through his grief, and hopes to help prevent other families from feeling the same pain. A lifetime athlete and former boxer, Barr's presentation style is high energy on purpose \u2014 and it too draws the students to the message.\nPresented to students in middle and high schools across the country, he reaches thousands each year with his work. He says, \" Kids don't care about how much you know until they know how much you care.\"\nShields shared, \"We are addicted almost at birth to sugar and salt \u2014 it's one of the reasons kids say they vape \u2014 because it tastes good.\" Shields has spent a lifetime understanding the reasons people and especially our kids get hooked on these substances so easily. These summits are one of the ways he says we can combat it \u2014 through understanding and providing a message that reaches the kids. Watching the response as he walked his audience through his presentation made it clear the message was hitting the mark.\nHigh school student Wyatt Tolker attending the session with his mom Kerieanne Hinerman, Dorchester County's Tobacco Program Coordinator, was inspired to write verse in response to one of the exercises.\nSpeaking after the session with Tolker, he relayed the thought process behind his inspiration, \"I've always written stuff \u2014 I have a notebook full of things I've written. When Dr. Shields asked us to write down our responses, I knew I wanted to present a message that would appeal and speak to the other kids in the room, regardless of their age.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Learning things never has to be boring,\" 10th grade ambassador Samuel Mora of Queen Anne's County High said.\nAfter completing the escape room, groups were invited to have a snack and share their experiences.\nThe QAC Drug Free student ambassadors had utilized the escape room idea to enter a national competition with Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Kille said. The goal of the competition was to enter an idea of how to share the dangers of pills with their peers, she said.\nThe students' escape room was selected as one of the top six winners of the competition's 200 entries, earning them $5,000, she said.\nOfficials with Save the Day Escape Rooms lent expertise and mentorship to help the ambassadors craft the perfect puzzle space, Kille said.\nA collaborative effort with the whole community, the ambassadors partnered with local businesses and drug-free organizations to offer the event including: the QAC Drug Free Coalition, Opioid Operational Command Center, Chesapeake YMCA, Save the Day Escape Rooms and the Mattress Store in Annapolis and Chester.\nInformation about QAC Goes Purple is available at qacgoespurple.org/home. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Shortly after, he founded the nonprofit to educate people about the disease.\nSince 2000, he has been devoted full time to the foundation. Prior to the pandemic, over 1,700 schools were using the lessons. As a member of the Rotary Club of Peabody, Massachusetts, in 2022, Fine expanded outreach to U.S. and Canadian Rotary Clubs in the Eastern and Atlantic time zones.\nHe uses the technology of virtual lessons to reach those who he would not otherwise be able to meet.\nFine received his doctorate in chemistry from Northeastern University, continuing his postdoctoral research at Lehigh University. After serving as assistant professor of organic chemistry at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, he moved to New England, where worked as technical and manager in high tech chemical companies. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's a leading cause of longterm disability that affects 80% families.\nPrice further read that professionals like Sukhdeo-Singh's team, are reaching out to the public and private schools here to spread that awareness as well as to Emergency services and the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Chestertown.\nSukhdeo-Singh showed the commissioners some materials of their organization as well as how to spot stroke symptoms in an easy-to-remember acronym:\nB-E-F-A-S-T\n\"B\" stands for balance. Often the first sign of a stroke, followed by \"E\" for eyes, distorting of vision. Then \"F\" for facial abnormalities, like freezing or tics. Then there could be tingling or numbness in the arms or legs, which is \"A\". \"S\" stands for \"speech,\" which if muddled, confused or slurred, it's then \"T\", Time to call 911.\nThe commissioners could relate, sharing experiences of their loved ones.\nPrice shared his father suffered a stroke at age 65, and although he lived to be 86, he said his recovery was never fully complete.\nCommission member Albert Nickerson recalled an incident when his niece insisted somebody check on her grandmother when she didn't show up for her soccer game. Her insistence and instincts were good. When someone checked on her, they discovered her grandmother was in the beginning stages of a stroke.\nCounty Attorney Tom Yeager shared also that his father suffered a stroke, but he was unsure of what it was at the time. He didn't seek help for it until a week later.\n\"That's why awareness is so important,\" Yeager said.\nSukhdeo-Singh called it, \"Spot a Stroke, Stop a Stroke, and Save a Life\".\nAnd using advanced procedures such as improved imaging technology, they can spot where the source of the stroke happens, the clot in the brain, and prescribe clot-busting medication before it's too late.\nOr surgery if needed.\n\"We work closely to reverse strokes or do surgical procedures to remove the clot from the brain,\" Sukhdeo-Singh said.\nLeonard thanked the commissioners for making July 27, Kent County Stroke Smart.\n\"This will help with the partnership with the County to get education and support our partnerships.\" \n\n (c) Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's a leading cause of longterm disability that affects 80% families.Price further read that professionals like Sukhdeo-Singh's team, are reaching out to the public and private schools here to spread that awareness as well as to Emergency services and the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Chestertown.\nSukhdeo-Singh showed the commissioners some materials of their organization as well as how to spot stroke symptoms in an easy-to-remember acronym:\nB-E-F-A-S-T\n\"B\" stands for balance. Often the first sign of a stroke, followed by \"E\" for eyes, distorting of vision. Then \"F\" for facial abnormalities, like freezing or tics. Then there could be tingling or numbness in the arms or legs, which is \"A\". \"S\" stands for \"speech,\" which if muddled, confused or slurred, it's then \"T\", Time to call 911.\nThe commissioners could relate, sharing experiences of their loved ones.\nPrice shared his father suffered a stroke at age 65, and although he lived to be 86, he said his recovery was never fully complete.\nCommission member Albert Nickerson recalled an incident when his niece insisted somebody check on her grandmother when she didn't show up for her soccer game. Her insistence and instincts were good. When someone checked on her, they discovered her grandmother was in the beginning stages of a stroke.\nCounty Attorney Tom Yeager shared also that his father suffered a stroke, but he was unsure of what it was at the time. He didn't seek help for it until a week later.\n\"That's why awareness is so important,\" Yeager said.\nSukhdeo-Singh called it, \"Spot a Stroke, Stop a Stroke, and Save a Life\".\nAnd using advanced procedures such as improved imaging technology, they can spot where the source of the stroke happens, the clot in the brain, and prescribe clot-busting medication before it's too late.\n\"We work closely to reverse strokes or do surgical procedures to remove the clot from the brain,\" Sukhdeo-Singh said.\nLeonard thanked the commissioners for making July 27, Kent County Stroke Smart.\n\"This will help with the partnership with the County to get education and support our partnerships.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Controlling the connection between the human brain and the brain of the computer has helped researchers in their studies.\nTransmitting information between the two brains has helped expose conscious and unconscious mental activity. Fields explained how cognitive performance can be improved by manipulating brainwaves.\nFields has authored his latest book, \"Electric Brain,\" which discusses the history, current research and future of brainwaves in monitoring and manipulating brain function. As a neuroscientist, he has written over 150 papers on scientific research as well as numerous books and magazine articles.\nA fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, he has received the Mensa Foundation Award for outstanding research in intelligence and creativity. Fields joined the National Institutes of Health in 1987, retiring as chief of the Nervous System Development and Plasticity Section in 2023.\nA resident of Taylor's Island in Dorchester County, Doug has such hobbies as wine making, guitar building and mountain climbing.\nFollowing his talk with the rotarians, he was inducted into the Rotary Club of Cambridge by past President Amanda Hailey with his sponsor, Pat Neild, by his side. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Around 40 people started at the James Wright Memorial Park and either ran or walked the course.Catherine Bowrey is the chair of the Caroline Goes Purple Color Run.\n\"I am glad to see everyone out here having a good time. We have to get aware of the drug epidemic, which is a big thing. The stigma is terrible. So this way they can come out and get aware of what is going on in their communities,\" Bowrey said.\nCaroline Goes Purple is organized by the Denton nonprofit Drug Free Caroline, a substance abuse disorder prevention and awareness program. Caroline Goes Purple is a community effort during the month of September to prevent drug use, heighten awareness and reduce the stigma around substance abuse disorder.\nJessica Tuel is the director of behavioral health for the Caroline County Health Department as well as the local addiction authority for Caroline County. She stood in front of a public health table filled with information, stress balls and pens.\n\"We do a lot of services in the schools both for substance use and mental health. We have full time clinicians in the north county schools and we have the Mobile Treatment Unit,\" Tuel said.\nHer work is data-led.\n\"The statistics say that the earlier people start using, the longer and higher risk their use is later. Today we are bringing awareness to substance abuse in our county. We have a lot of vendors that are going to give education and services for those who need them. It is important to all these peers here, who are in a state of recovery. That is what all of the Caroline Goes Purple events are for,\" she said.\nAs a public health expert she wants both education and anti stigma to get across.\n\"Stigma is multifaceted. So it is stigma of the community against those who use. It is stigma of those that don't want treatment because they fear they will be judged. It is 'We don't have this problem in Caroline County,'\" Tuel said.\nThe remedy to stigma is education and bringing statistics to the community, she said.\nAngel Perez, the former Caroline Goes Purple Chair, was at this year's event as a volunteer.\n\"This event is important because we can raise awareness about substance abuse prevention and what is going on in our communities. We created this event last year to raise awareness in a fun way. Everybody can enjoy, but also get the information. We want to make them aware of what is going on in our community with substance abuse,\" Perez said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Students like Riaz are taking initiative to address these disparities and help close the medical disparity through the Rural Health Equity and Access Longitudinal Elective.\nThe students will be provided didactic and mentoring sessions as well as research and clinical experiences on the Eastern Shore.\nLeah Millstein, the program director and associate professor of medicine, said there's a real challenge for the population of the Eastern Shore in finding and accessing exemplary healthcare.\n\"There's a shortage in primary care doctors as well as specialties, and we often have students who are interested in rural medical care in their futures, but their exposure to it during medical school is limited,\" Millstein said. \"So this program seeks to fill those gaps, to really give the students an in depth exposure to rural health care, and give them the building blocks that allow them to feel like they'll be successful serving as physicians in those communities when they're done with their training.\"\nRiaz said her initial circumstances in Punjab made her realize the importance of one-to-one connection with patients and their medical providers.\n\"I personally faced the challenges of not discussing quality healthcare due (to a) shortage of physicians,\" Riaz said. \"Individuals of my village have to go to far off places to get necessary healthcare.\"\nThe program is designed to train and place incoming medical students in Eastern Shore healthcare practices. About $1.4 million has been secured in state funding and from the University of Maryland, Baltimore; University of Maryland Eastern Shore; the Rural Maryland Council and many donors.\nMillstein said three of the six students accepted into the program were awarded full-tuition scholarships with a commitment to working on the Eastern Shore for four years after completing residency training. The long-term goal is to support 10 students interested in rural health in this elective program each year.\nKen Kozel, president and CEO of University of Maryland Shore Regional Health, said this program will help draw new providers to the Eastern Shore.\n\"Strengthening our provider workforce is a top priority at UM SRH, and programs like R-HEALE will help us attract providers who want to practice in rural communities,\" Kozel said. \"We greatly appreciate our partnership with the School of Medicine toward enhancing access across the Shore.\"\nFor Riaz, she is happy for the opportunity to focus on improving rural areas and assisting caring for the people in rural areas.\n\"With this program, I'll be able to be involved in research projects that are deeply focused on improving population and community health, and also to deeply understand the social, economic or cultural factors that are rooted in the disparities of such communities,\" she said. \"I think this comprehensive training through our field will allow me to deliver more compassionate and patient centered care in the future.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Four out of every five of Maryland public schools received aid for mental health services under the state's effort.But as the General Assembly moved to balance Maryland's fiscal 2025 budget last spring, lawmakers cut funding for the state's fledgling youth mental health program from Gov. Wes Moore's recommended $110 million to $40 million.\nWith the state's fiscal problems deepening, Moore is recommending the state allocate $40 million annually through 2030 to a program he once suggested should get $130 million a year starting in fiscal 2026.\nMeagan Pantelis, a clinical social worker at Thrive Behavioral Health, said the proposed cuts would decimate services for students that, in many cases, are just getting off the ground.\n\"Whenever I found out about that proposed cut, the very first thing that came to mind is that Gov. Moore is wanting to balance a budget on the backs of our children,\" Pantelis said. \"I just find that to be just egregious. I mean, why are our children the population that we are targeting? Why are they not the population that we want to build up and support?\"\nMoore, however, has stressed the state must act to close a structural $3 billion budget gap driven in part by the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the 10-year, multibillion-dollar education reform plan that created the youth mental health program.\n\"We only have difficult decisions ahead,\" Moore said in his State of the State address in early February. \"We must close this $3 billion budget gap.\"\nThe mental health crisisDuring the 2022-23 school year, over a quarter of Maryland high school students reported their mental health was not good at most or all times, according to a Maryland Department of Health survey.\nThe percentage was only slightly lower for middle school students, with 22% reporting their mental health was not good at most or all times.\n\"We all know generally that there's a mental health crisis,\" said Lorianne Moss, the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission program manager. \"So as sort of the preamble to our first call for proposals, we laid out some data.\"\nThat data, from the Centers for Disease Control, showed 40% of high school students experience persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Citing such statistics, the consortium urged mental health programs and nonprofits across the state to apply for funds.\nApplicants requested a total of $380 million in grants, said Mark Luckner, executive director of the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission, which oversees the consortium. That's more than three times what the consortium had to allocate.\nNevertheless, the state funded mental health service providers in every county.\nPreventing youth suicide is one of the consortium's key goals, said Dr. John Campo, director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Sixteen of the consortium's 129 grants so far focus on suicide prevention.\nSuicide is the second-leading cause of death for people ages 10-14 and third for people ages 15-24, according to the most recent CDC data.\n\"Suicide kills more young people in that age group than cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, infections of all kinds, meningitis, pneumonia, HIV, COVID \u2014 the whole nine yards,\" Campo said. \"Add them all together, suicide kills more people than all those things combined.\"\nIn Maryland, the teen suicide rate increased by more than a third from 2014 to 2022. Campo said the state's health care system has been ill-equipped to deal with that increase.\n\"Mental health crisis isn't a priority in most emergency departments,\" Campo said.\nCampo is one of the co-chairs of the consortium's best practices subcommittee, a group that developed a list of evidence-based mental health practices for grantees to implement.\nEach program targets a different facet of the mental health crisis. The responses are also tailored to the varying levels of severity of the mental health conditions different age groups experience.\nThe consortium found through surveys targeted at both students and parents that 90% of students and families were satisfied with the services.\n\"A lot of these practices have been tested,\" Campo said. \"If regional organizations adopt them and implement them with fidelity, we really do want to believe that there will be positive outcomes associated with it.\"\nFrom the city to the ShoreThe youth mental health crisis touches all of Maryland, and so does the state's response \u2014 but grants are tailored to the vast differences among Maryland's urban, suburban and rural communities.\nIn Baltimore City, the 11 grants the consortium issued take into account a stigma surrounding mental health services, said Jennifer Cox, director of the University of Maryland School Mental Health Program, which received a $970,000 grant to run a number of programs.\n\"We think in Baltimore City, we have to be a little bit more creative than just saying, 'Come get help,' \" Cox said. \"We know we have good things to offer, we just need to find a good way to offer it.\"\nWorking with trusted community organizations such as churches and youth centers, the program has been able to reach people who would otherwise not seek out mental health treatment, Cox said.\nServices range from in-school counseling from certified clinicians to parent and caregiver education programs.\nMeanwhile, the state's efforts on the largely rural Eastern Shore stress increasing access to treatment in a region that's short of professionals to respond to the youth mental health crisis.\nAccording to the October 2024 report, \"Investing in Maryland's Behavioral Health Talent,\" Maryland is nearly 50% short of the mental health workers it needs.\n\"There's a resounding message of 'we just need more,'\" said Beth Anne Dorman, CEO of For All Seasons, a behavioral health and rape crisis center that received a grant to expand its services in Kent County. \"We need more.\"\nCaroline County, where two organizations won grants to expand their mental health services, faces the same situation, said Derek Simmons, the county's superintendent of schools.\n\"We are a rural county that is less wealthy than a lot of parts of the state,\" said Simmons, co-chair of the consortium's best practices committee. \"So access to behavioral health is near and dear, and a real challenge where I'm at.\"\nAn uncertain future\nIf the General Assembly agrees with the funding levels suggested in the governor's budget, programs that just started last year may have to be eliminated, said Del. Eric Ebersole (D-Baltimore County, Howard).\n\"That group worked in good faith to bring providers online,\" said Ebersole, a consortium member. \"If the government loses them, can you get them back?\"\nDan Martin, senior director of public policy at the Mental Health Association of Maryland, said the proposed cut in planned funding comes at a time when youth mental health care is more important than ever.\n\"At a time when 18% of high school students and 24% of middle school students have seriously considered suicide in the past year, a reduction of this size in school mental health funding could prove disastrous,\" Martin said.\nIf the General Assembly approves Moore's budget proposal, the grants distributed by the program in fiscal years 2025 and 2026 combined will be cut 28% from the total amount distributed the prior two years.\nAsked for comment, Moore's office stressed the governor's proposed allocation for fiscal year 2026 and beyond is exactly what the General Assembly approved for 2025.\n\"Gov. Moore is maintaining the current level of funding for the Maryland Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports,\" wrote a spokesperson from the governor's office. \"The Governor strongly supports behavioral health treatment for Maryland's children, and maintaining current levels of funding during the state's budget crisis reflects that commitment.\"\nThe Mental Health Association of Maryland is urging action to try to persuade the General Assembly to restore funding to a higher level. The organization is circulating a fact sheet with information on the consortium, the work it's done and what a permanent cut in funding would do to students and schools.\n\"Use the above information and write an email to your legislators asking them to restore funding to the Community Supports Partnership Fund,\" the fact sheet said. \"Provide testimony (either written or oral or both) opposing the cut\" at General Assembly hearings.\nAnd under the \"why is funding needed\" section, the Mental Health Association fact sheet reads: \"Dramatic worsening of the behavioral health of children and youth over the last decade.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From crisis to change: COVID-19\u2019s enduring mark on the Eastern Shore\n\n March 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STAFF REPORT | Section: Local News \n \n 642\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic reached the Eastern Shore, its impact lingers in ways both visible and unseen. The empty streets, masked faces, and social distancing markers have faded, but the profound shifts in health care, worship, business and daily life remain.Emma Zonetti never expected the pandemic to reach her tight-knit community.\n\"I remember being in church, actually. My husband's mom told me that this was happening,\" said Zonetti, now a senior clinical nurse with University of Maryland Shore Regional Health. \"And I went, 'Oh, it's nothing to worry about. It's just another virus.' And then quickly did we learn that it was way more than that.\"\nZonetti, who was a clinical coordinator in the telemetry unit at the Shore Medical Center at Easton during the height of the crisis, recalled the stark reality that unfolded as cases surged.\n\"It certainly impacted us far larger than I could ever anticipate,\" she said.\nLate in January 2020, hospitals began screening for the virus as patients arrived in emergency rooms.\nBy March, State Superintendent of Schools Dr. Karen Salmon ordered a closure of schools \u2014 a temporary order that extended well into 2021, much longer than anyone anticipated.\nBeaches and boardwalks closed. And by April, the number of positive cases surged and mask orders ensued.\nCOMMUNITY BLINDSIDEDThe first confirmed case of COVID-19 on the Eastern Shore was reported in Talbot County on March 16, 2020. Since then, there have been 8,056 confirmed cases in the county and more than 40,000 across the Mid-Shore. The virus claimed the lives of 592 Mid-Shore residents.\nFor religious communities, the impact was swift and disruptive. Pastor Doug Morley of Greater Impact Church in Greensboro said the closure of worship spaces came at a critical time for his newly merged congregation.\n\"Building on the momentum of coming together for greater Kingdom impact in 2019 and gearing up for what would potentially be one of our highest attended worship experiences on Easter Sunday (April 12, 2020), we were definitely blindsided by the mandated closure of all religious gatherings,\" Morley said.\nChurch leaders scrambled to adapt, turning to Facebook Live for virtual worship and launching a \"drive-in\" service using a tractor-trailer bed as a stage and an FM transmitter to broadcast services to parked cars.\n\"It forced us to think outside the four walls of the church,\" Morley said. \"That shift in approach has remained with us.\"\nEven after indoor services resumed, Morley noted, worship attendance has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. While some members embraced online services, others simply fell out of the habit.\nLASTING LEGACYWhen Maryland lifted its COVID-19 state of emergency on July 1, 2021, many expected a swift return to normalcy. In some ways, that happened \u2014 travel resumed, restaurants filled and hugs replaced distanced greetings. But the pandemic left lasting imprints on the Eastern Shore.\nTelehealth became commonplace. Remote work grew. Businesses closed, moved or downsized. Schools and universities permanently integrated virtual options. Many delayed retirement. Awareness of mental health surged as loneliness and isolation persisted.\nThe pandemic reshaped our priorities, forcing people to rethink work, education and social connection. Some changes were temporary, but others \u2014 like digital access and hybrid work models \u2014 are likely here to stay.\nWhile it has taken a few years to get back to some semblance of normalcy, the impact of COVID-19 upon regular worship attendance is still evident.\n\"We have not returned to pre-pandemic numbers, and we still have individuals and families who choose to worship online rather than in-person,\" Morely said. \"A few who once attended regularly have gotten out of the habit and find it difficult to return on a consistent basis.\"\nAs the Eastern Shore reflects on the past five years, the region has found resilience in adversity. Communities innovated, businesses adapted and individuals discovered new ways to connect. The pandemic may have left its mark, but so, too, did the spirit of perseverance that defines the Shore. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

While the virus disrupted lives, it also accelerated innovations and exposed critical gaps in infrastructure, healthcare and social support systems.\nThe digital divide, long a silent challenge for rural communities, suddenly became a lifeline during lockdowns. Broadband expansion, once a slow-moving initiative, gained momentum as remote work, telehealth and online education became necessities rather than conveniences.\nMental health emerged as another critical frontier. The isolation, uncertainty and collective trauma of the pandemic laid bare the state of community mental wellness.\nThe federal government's response came in the form of the American Rescue Plan Act, a massive injection of funds designed to support communities struggling in the pandemic's wake. These funds became a lifeline for local governments, schools and healthcare systems, offering a temporary reprieve and an opportunity for strategic reinvestment.\nThe pandemic forced communities to reimagine infrastructure, healthcare delivery, education and social connectivity. Each challenge became an opportunity for innovation, each obstacle a chance to rebuild more resiliently.\nIn this section, we'll explore these lasting impacts \u2014 how broadband expansion bridged critical access gaps, how mental health challenges surfaced and began to be addressed, and how ARPA funds were deployed to support communities during their most vulnerable moment. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

COVID helped bring more awareness to a topic that needed to be more focused on, experts say.\"So I think what COVID did was it brought to light that we all experience mental health symptoms,\" said For All Seasons President and CEO Beth Anne Dorman.\nOn March 13, 2020, the first Trump Administration declared a nationwide emergency. The world stopped for what many thought would only be two weeks. It turned out to be much longer.\nAt schools, some seniors didn't get the chance to walk the stage or have their senior prom, which caused mental health officials in schools to be proactive on making sure students were in good spirits.\n\"In that first early wave, we did not have behavioral health providers working for us at Choptank,\" said Chrissy Bartz, PA-C director of Community Based Programs at Choptank Community Health System.\n\"The therapists that were already working in the schools, they connected with those students at home as soon as they could. Fortunately with COVID came virtual and telehealth opportunities that we had never seen before in care.\"\nStudents experienced many different mental health problems. Some students were forced to be at home every day in situations that were unhealthy. Some lost the fresh meals they received at school.\nMental health officials were forced to be proactive in student care outside of school.\n\"We made really conscious efforts to reach out to students that we had been seeing in the schools because for a lot of them, we're the only resource that they have,\" Bartz said.\nWhen students started to return to school, mental health officials discovered students were having a hard time getting reacquainted with daily routines and interacting with other students.\n\"I think one of the things that happened right away when we got back into schools, we started to identify some of the behaviors that came with them feeling socially isolated or not having normal routines,\" Bartz said. \"We had a lot of kids come back really anxious because they hadn't been in a setting like this before. They had been out of it and now needed to reacclimatized themselves.\"\nFor adults, the shutdown meant multiple different things. According to Dorman, some patients experienced different trauma and needed more care than others. That's why staying open was a priority for For All Seasons, she said.\n\"We knew that mental health was not an option to shut down,\" Dorman said. \"We are very much a part of the first responder healthcare line. Our major pieces were how do we keep things like the rape crisis center still moving? How do we make sure that we never closed fully? We had 25-30% of our staff in person all the time.\"\n\"... Loneliness, grief, anxiety, depression, were all up,\" Doorman said. \"I think the impact was heavy on families when the time started ticking. Our brains are not programmed for unknowns. Our brains are programmed for beginnings and ends. COVID brought a lot of uncertainty.\"\nAccording to Dorman, adults struggled adapting to regular daily routines as restrictions began to lift.\nThe numbers for adults seeking mental health services continued to rise because now people were aware of some mental health issues they had not been before, Dorman said.\n\"What we saw was that there were for the first time maybe folks were starting to recognize that they were struggling,\" she said. \"That as they're starting to put one foot back in front of the other, maybe they were feeling more anxiety than they'd ever felt before because now they had to step out of their home which had been comfortable in this time.\"\nAccording to Dorman, COVID showed that people all experience mental health in a different way.\n\"What I think COVID did was it helped us view connection differently,\" she said. \"It helped us to be able to bring language to some of the things that we were all experiencing. I think in some terms it talks about like leveling the playing field for mental health. Leveling the playing field in a way that we had language to put to what people were feeling.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Youth mental health initiatives see minimal cuts\n\n April 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SASHA ALLEN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 771\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Maryland mental health advocates and providers are relieved coming out of this year's legislative session, where state lawmakers decided against a drastic cut in funding to the state's year-old, big-money program aimed at improving the mental health of its young people.The Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports, created under the state's ambitious and expensive education reform plan called the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, will receive $70 million from the state's fiscal year 2026 budget to award mental health providers in its second round of grants. That's up from the $40 million Gov. Wes Moore originally suggested spending.\nBut with some money left over from funding this past fiscal year, the consortium plans to allocate closer to $98 million in grants. Legislators previously allocated $119.7 million over two years to set up the consortium and issued its first $111 million of grants in February 2024.\nPartly as a result of those grants, more than 80% of Maryland public schools now have some sort of mental health service available for students. And mental health advocates said the additional funding means the state's effort will continue to reach a large percentage of the state's children.\n\"This is a critical investment that's ensuring students in every corner of our state have the resources and support necessary to learn and thrive,\" said Dan Martin, senior director of public policy at the Mental Health Association of Maryland. \"We couldn't be happier.\"\nThe consortium provides mental health funding for dozens of services, including in-school counseling, substance abuse treatment and peer support groups for families and students.\nBut at the beginning of this year's difficult legislative session where the General Assembly would have to fill a $3 billion budget hole, Moore proposed a spending plan that allocated only $40 million to the youth mental health effort \u2014 even though he once proposed the program should receive $130 million for fiscal year 2026.\nThe General Assembly, however, passed a bill on the last day of the legislative session that added $30 million to the youth mental health budget on top of what Moore had proposed, leaving many relieved for the future of the program.\nSen. Katie Fry Hester, a Democrat representing Montgomery and Howard counties, said this decision was crucial for the future of the consortium and the youth mental health programs it funds.\n\"I think when you're trying to address the mental health needs of the entire state, you can't really do it piecemeal,\" Hester said.\nIf funding for the consortium had been limited to the amount suggested in Moore's budget, \"you would have to redo the entire program,\" Hester added.\nThe consortium's grant allocations are designed around a \"hub and spoke\" model that aims to include community organizations in the program. The hubs, or organizations already established in Maryland's counties, including churches and community centers, help promote and run the services of the spokes, or mental health programs. Both are funded through consortium grants.\n\"The hub and spoke model would not have worked at $40 million,\" Hester said.\nWhile the community organizations are in different stages of operation in each county, Mark Luckner, executive director of the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission, said the funding provided will allow for the program to move closer to full implementation this upcoming year.\nLuckner said a good number of active service providers have applied for the second round of funding, which the consortium is expected to issue by June 30.\nThe initial 127 grants were projected to serve about 150,000 people, \"and they're well on their way to do that globally,\" Luckner said at Thursday's consortium meeting.\nLuckner said he believes within two years, as many as 22 of the state's 24 jurisdictions will either have a fully operational or almost fully operational youth mental health hub.\n\"We should just take a moment and celebrate that accomplishment that the consortium is achieving,\" Luckner said.\nService providers agree. Jan Guszynski is the project manager for Prosper, an app that, under Uneo Health, provides mental health check ins-for adolescents. The app received $1.4 million grants to provide services in Prince George's, Frederick and Calvert counties.\nBefore the legislation was passed confirming $70 million in consortium funding for fiscal year 2026, Guszynski said she was worried for the future of not only mental health services but for the students using them.\n\"I really, really hope that we do not see these resources shuttered or too heavily impacted as time goes on,\" Guszynski said. \"Because it's hugely important.\"\nThose resources won't likely get shuttered or too heavily impacted if the General Assembly sticks with the outline it set in the budget it just passed, which projects $100 million in youth mental health funding in fiscal year 2027 and $100 million annually after that. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "As young Americans struggle with mental health, online support surges\n\n June 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAX SCHAEFFER Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1705\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Adolescents across the country have increasingly suffered from anxiety and depression over the last 10 years, and school officials in Prince George's County noticed the same trend locally.So when the county's public school system needed to support its struggling students, it did what schools and young people across the nation are doing \u2014 it turned to an online service.\nFunded by the statewide effort to bolster youth mental health, the county partnered with Hazel Health, which specializes in providing online counseling to school-age children.\n\"I think accessibility is huge,\" Emily Pasco, the school district's mental health coordinator, said of the partnership. \"That's historically been a barrier for mental health services \u2014 transportation is an issue.\"\nSupporters of online mental health services argue that they offer a convenient option in an era when providers are in short supply. According to a 2024 federal study, more than a third of the nation's residents live in an area where there aren't enough mental health professionals.\nEnter online services such as Hazel, Gaggle, Counslr and Cope Notes.\n\"We are not a silver bullet; we are not going to solve everyone's problems, but we can be a great gap-fill,\" said Andrew Post, Hazel's president.\nOnline mental health services surged in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic when most in-person options were shut down, and it has remained popular in the years since.\nWith the online medium evolving every day, there is no consensus about it among psychological researchers, but various studies have shown online interventions can do some good.\nFor example, a 2024 study from the National Institutes of Health found there were \"promising results regarding the effectiveness of online interventions in young people, especially for symptoms of anxiety and depression and for training of social functioning.\"\nMegan Taylor, an independent licensed clinical psychologist from Northern Virginia with online and in-person therapy experience, said online therapy can sometimes feel safer to patients than seeing a therapist in person.\nYet the online medium makes it easier for unlicensed or unreliable providers to provide services they aren't qualified to provide, said Taylor, who has extensive experience with youngsters with autism.\n\"I feel really passionate about the fact that there are many therapists, who advertise themselves as being neurodiversity affirming or specializing in autism, but really haven't had that training,\" Taylor said.\nDespite such concerns, online therapy is expected to grow as an option for troubled young people nationwide. Zion Market Research projects the global market for online therapy for teens to more than triple from 2023 through 2032.\nThat being the case, here's a closer look at several online mental health care options available to young people today:\nHazel\nHazel was one of the big winners in the state's first round of grants from its new youth mental health program, receiving $2.75 million in Prince George's County, $1.5 million in Baltimore City and smaller grants in Charles and St. Mary's counties.\nStudents in Prince George's County and elsewhere access Hazel's counselors through video conference, either at school or home. Post said the medium offers limitations as well as benefits for the students who access it.\n\"We are raising a generation of children who are very comfortable, for better or worse, with technology,\" Post said. \"This construct of, 'I'm going to drop you off at this office and I'll pick you up in an hour,' is a little jarring, compared to, 'I'm going to hand you this iPad and you're going to see this person and talk to them.'\"\nDespite being a proponent of telehealth therapy, Post acknowledged for severe cases, in-person treatment always has to be an option for young people.\nPrince George's County \u2014 like Miami-Dade County, Florida, where Post taught and served as an administrator \u2014 is a majority-minority community where over half of the student population qualifies for free and reduced lunch. This comes with additional mental health challenges for students to navigate.\nIn 2024, Prince George's County saw 113 homicides.\n\"Gun violence is a significant issue,\" Pasco said. \"Students being affected by either witnessing gun violence, or being affected by someone that they know being a victim of gun violence.\"\nThe top two most common reasons for referral, according to Pasco, are depression and anxiety, consistent with national trends.\nOne way Hazel looks to serve the unique needs of communities like Prince George's County is to only use providers who are licensed in the state.\n\"Number two is making sure that our population group truly reflects the population that we serve,\" Post said.\nTwo out of every five Hazel therapists fluently speak a language other than English, according to Post.\nGaggle\nLike Hazel, Gaggle \u2014 which began in 1999 as an early email communication system between teachers and students in schools \u2014 provides online therapy. The company has evolved over the last 25 years, first into an online safety management platform and now a provider of teletherapy.\nGaggle's safety management operation is still the primary service it provides to school districts, with over 1,500 districts using it. Just over 100 school districts use its telehealth service, although no Maryland school district uses it.\nGrowing the company's telehealth operation is a company priority, said Heather Durkac, Gaggle's chief innovation officer.\n\"Gaggle started and is involved with protecting those 'digital hallways' \u2014 what kids were emailing, sending, sharing, uploading, everything that was on district-provided devices or accounts,\" she said.\nIncreasing concerns about mental health and self-harm \u2014 which company officials noted through its safety monitoring service \u2014 inspired the company to offer teletherapy as well.\n\"I used to talk about [during training with school districts] if students would send something like a suicide note or share suicidal thoughts,\" Durkac said. \"Now I talk about it in a position of when students are sharing those suicidal thoughts or a suicide note. That really just compelled us to do something more.\"\nThe company made 20,000 phone calls to school districts for situations their safety analysts deemed an imminent threat for a student, and over 400,000 emails to school districts for concerns of a lower level, according to Durkac.\nDurkac shared a story of Gaggle's intervention when a student wrote a suicide note on a Google Doc on his school-issued Gmail account, which school officials saw because Gaggle's safety management system gave them access to it. Gaggle contacted the school, and officials there got the student's family and police involved. The student was found at the local train tracks and taken to a hospital.\nWith a combination of Gaggle's services, a school district could continue to work with the student to help prevent a similar situation.\n\"If it is one of those districts that has both services, they can choose to move them right into our Gaggle therapy services. If not, they have other resources,\" Durkac said.\nIf one decides to access Gaggle's therapy services, the company employs a team of licensed therapists that mostly do part-time work online while working with their own practice or serving as a supervisor somewhere else.\nCounslr\nAnother of the most widespread online counseling providers is Counslr, a service that partners with large companies, schools and communities. Counslr is partnered with school districts across 11 states but not Maryland \u2014 although it works with Child Trends, a Rockville-based nonprofit that researches child well-being.\nCounslr offers text-based mental health support with a licensed mental health professional at any hour of the day. Students complete a basic intake form and are matched with a professional who is supposed to best fit their needs.\n\"We are particularly effective at what we call 'reaching the traditionally unreachable,'\" Counslr co-founder and CEO Josh Liss said.\nHe said Counslr's text-based method helps people avoid typical hurdles like cost, inconvenience or negative stigma around getting help.\n\"The majority of the sessions on our platform deal with relationship issues,\" Liss said. \"Very challenging to have a video session, when the person you want to talk about is lying in the bed next to you.\"\nCounslr is free for the students or members of its partner school districts or organizations. That entity pays Counslr for its services to be accessible to its students or members.\nLiss said he is confident in Counslr's ability to help its users, but recognizes its limits.\n\"We very intentionally do not provide therapy,\" Liss said. \"Our counselors don't diagnose, they don't treat and they don't prescribe medication.\"\nWhen someone requires a more intensive form of care, like therapy, the company works with the school counseling office to facilitate that, Liss said.\nCope Notes\nCope Notes founder Johnny Crowder said he grew up with \"severe mental illness\" and had always resisted seeking treatment.\nOnce he got older and began to study psychology and neuroscience, that aversion turned to a curiosity and passion for helping people.\n\"I started texting people health education content from my phone,\" Crowder said, \"and eventually started building it into something more nuanced.\"\nThis is how Crowder developed Cope Notes, a subscription-based service that sends users a text at a random point in the day.\nThe texts are written by a peer, or someone with experience with whatever challenge their text references, then reviewed by Cope Notes' clinical oversight panel of mental health professionals before being sent out.\nOne of the biggest challenges is finding a text that will be general enough to apply to a range of subscribers but specific enough to help. The service is anonymous, so the providers aren't aware of who they're texting.\n\"We're serving people, let's say one of them is a rural teenager with bipolar and one person is like an urban senior with no mental health conditions,\" Crowder said. \"How the heck do you craft a content library that is applicable across all of those demographics, if you don't have that information?\"\nAnswering this question has become a big part of the company's content review process.\nNo two people ever get the same text at once, and the text comes through at a random time, although the company is working on features that will allow people to personalize their experience, according to Crowder.\nThe current Cope Notes pricing model allows someone to purchase an individual subscription for an annual cost of just over $100. Cope Notes also offers group subscriptions for companies or schools.\nCrowder recognizes Cope Notes is not a replacement for therapy. He said he feels Cope Notes is a resource that can be used to get someone ready for treatment in therapy, or help someone who has finished their therapy have some consistent support.\n\"I would say it's a great step up or step down [from therapy],\" Crowder said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As I said Tuesday, this is about Meals til Monday as a whole, but it really felt good to be honored.\"\nAllen began working volunteering for Meals til Monday during the pandemic. She then obtained her community health worker certificate to help people access services like Medicare and Medicaid. Allen said this naturally aligned with her work at Meals til Monday.\nHer recognition comes after a yearlong process of filing for grants, receiving donations and working with community organization partners to buy a refrigerated van, which allows Meals til Monday's summer program to reach more children in Dorchester County and expands the program's capabilities.\n\"It's not necessarily about how many more kids that we're reaching as much as it's about what else we can give the kids,\" Allen said. With the van, Allen said they are able to pick up large bins, also known as gaylords, of produce and frozen foods that would otherwise go bad.\nSummer is identified by Food Action and Research Center as the hungriest time for kids because they lose access to free school meals. In Dorchester County, students are provided free daily breakfast and lunch through a federally funded program called the Community Eligibility Provision.\nThis provision is available if 25% or more of the student population participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations or Medicaid, according to the United States Department of Agriculture's website.\n\"We have partnered with Dorchester County Public Schools and we are delivering two meals for seven days to anyone that registers for children 18 and under,\" Allen said.\nAllen said Meals til Monday is still providing regular weekend meal bags for anyone who needs them, and emergency food services are available with options for pick-up or delivery by appointment.\nAllen encourages anyone who wants to volunteer to sign up on the website. \"One of the things that we're trying to do as we continue to grow as an organization is to have the appropriate policies and waivers and things like that for our volunteers.\" Those can be found at midshoremealstilmonday.org.\n\"It feels absolutely wonderful. I am just so honored,\" Allen said about receiving recognition from No Kid Hungry. \"Our primary mission is to feed children.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This was about learning how to do what we do better.\"\nThe program included one-on-one mentorship, monthly virtual leadership meetings and three in-person sessions, including a two-day intensive leadership training. Participants also completed a collaborative project addressing a specific health care issue or topic.\nDanielle Wilson, senior vice president and chief nursing officer of Shore Regional Health, championed the program internally and encouraged her managers to apply.\n\"Investing in nursing leadership is investing in patient care,\" Wilson said. \"Nurse leaders have the opportunity and responsibility to continue to innovate and advance standards of care. We are grateful that three of our nurse managers had the opportunity to engage in this transformative initiative.\"\nFor more information on the Nurse Leadership Institute, visit umshoreregional.org/nli. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Working with Cecil College, Union Hospital has been offering Camp Scrubs since 2014 (pandemic notwithstanding). Hunter said the program has gained popularity with a waiting list for next year. Middle school aged students attend Camp Scrubs in June, with the high school cohort in August.\n\"We had two camps last year and this year,\" Hunter said. \"There will be three next year.\"\nTuition is $315 and eight scholarships are made available each year.\nOn Friday, Camp Scrubs was learning CPR and how to use a mechanized and an inflatable lift \u2014 a hover jack and a hover bed respectively \u2014 for easier and safer patient transfer. As one group took turns learning the different transfer methods, another was run through the paces of treating a patient in cardiac arrest.\nFor Brionna Iraca-Reeves and Simone Akehurst, Camp Scrubs is an introduction into what each hopes will be a career in medicine.\n\"I've wanted to be a trauma surgeon for as long as I can remember,\" Iraca-Reeves, 16, from Oxford, Pa. said. \"I didn't have a Plan B.\"\nAkehurst, 16, from Bear, Del. also plans to be a trauma surgeon.\n\"We learned a lot in the OR,\" Akehurst said of their visit to an operating room at the hospital on Bow Street in Elkton. \"We saw a total hip replacement and a tonsillectomy.\n\"I also got to hold a gall bladder in the (pathology) lab,\" Akehurst said.\nAlong with getting introduced to the many aspects of a hospital the teens also got to talk with some of its professionals, which Akehurst called valuable.\n\"This morning I got to talk to a general surgeon,\" said the trauma surgeon hopeful. \"He told me trauma surgeon is more medical than surgical. I want the opportunity to do more surgery. General surgery is a very broad skillset.\"\n\"A lot of it is mentoring in the field you want to pursue,\" Iraca-Reeves said.\nIraca-Reeves said any student with health care aspirations should consider attending Camp Scrubs. She credits Hunter with making the program valuable, informative but also engaging.\n\"She's all wrapped up in giving people the best experience,\" Iraca-Reeves said. \"I think it's really important to recognize Katie and all she's done.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The county only has about $677,000 available in funding, and all the projects outlined total over $1 million, according to County Administrator Todd Mohn.\nQueen Anne's County Public Schools Opioid Education Partnership will utilize $209,025 of the opioid restitution funds in preventing youth opioid misuse through a school-based program and student-led awareness campaigns. It also aims to educate the broader community through public events, and distributing data-rich materials.\nQueen Anne's County Department of Health Educational Support programs will be provided $89,251 to strengthen overdose education, prevention, and response.\nThis project also includes a re-entry program for individuals released from the detention center and an expansion to the court-assisted recovery program to provide alternatives to incarceration.\nThe commissioners reached a consensus to reconsider other programs at a future time as additional resources and partnerships become available.\nCounties were awarded Maryland's opioid restitution funds to have autonomy to create plans on how to address avoiding addiction in communities, according to County Health Officer Brice Strang.\nPrograms that were traditionally funded have been denied funding this year, including the public school program, he said.\nStrang is now recommending the Board of Health create a county evidence-based mechanism to support current programming and showcase how it is working in the community, such as the school based programing. Strang recommended using the funding to backfill the programs, and \"wait and see\" on federal and state funding.\nA constant messaging to youth in particular is important, he said, and the commissioners praised the works of the Drug Free Coalition, the Student Ambassadors, and county partnerships.\n\"One of the things we already know is prevention is cheaper than treatment,\" Strang said.\nRemembering when programs initially began, Commission President Chris Corchiarino noted just how far the community has come in regard to opioid awareness and preventing overdoses.\nTo continually keep overdose numbers down, Corchiarino said, new initiatives are always needed to keep awareness moving forward and make sure preventive programs stay at the forefront.\n\"And that forefront is in our schools, for sure,\" Commissioner Phil Dumenil said.\nMore information about Queen Anne's County Drug Free Coalition can be found at qacgoespurple.org.\nIn other business it was noted, phase three of the South Island Trail extension project took one step closer as a construction and paving bid was awarded to David A. Bramble Inc. in the amount of $593,030.\nThis approximately 3,500 feet portion of the project faced time constraints due to its wooded and wildlife areas and is set to begin Sept. 1.\nWith a grant through the Maryland Office of Tourism Development, Queen Anne's County Economic and Tourism Development will be taking the show on the road with a mobile visitors center trailer to be purchased from Advantage Trailers for $91,778.\nThe trailer will serve to elevate tourism throughout the county by strategically placing it in high traffic areas and events. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025",

Gamble said the program has since changed to reflect the evolving drug trends in the county.\nGamble said he created Talbot Goes Purple to start a conversation the county wasn't having. He said he was speaking at a fundraiser when he had this realization.\n\"I stood up and I said, 'raise your hand if you talk to your kids about drinking and driving,' and all 400 hands went up. And I said, 'raise your hands if you talk to your kids, your grandkids, about seatbelt use,' and 400 hands went up. And then I said, 'Raise your hand if you talk to your kids about prescription painkillers,' and only 11 hands went up,\" Gamble said.\nFor Gamble, these were conversations that parents, guardians and community members needed to be having with their children to give them the proper tools to handle situations involving drugs.\n\"In my world of policing, 80% of what we deal with is connected to some form of substance abuse,\" Gamble said.\nMaryland has tracked much fewer overdose deaths for the past two years. According to Gamble, there has only been one overdose in Talbot County this year.\nHowever, fentanyl is still a major concern, he said. \"We're not seeing any heroin in Talbot County, Maryland that doesn't have fentanyl in it,\" Gamble said. \"We're seeing a lot of cocaine in Talbot County, Maryland that has fentanyl in it.\"\nEducational efforts through September will be extensive, Goes Purple organizers said, and they will address fentanyl along with other substances.\nTalbot Goes Purple Coordinator Kelley Callaghan said the broadening of the program's focus to include education on marijuana is more important than ever with a potential dispensary coming to Easton, and Gamble agrees.\n\"Youth are being hospitalized for marijuana use,\" Gamble said. \"I want parents to understand, you know, the weed they smoked when they were in college 30 years ago is not the same weed today.\"\nCallaghan highlighted alcohol as one of the commonly abused drugs by youth.\nThere will be posters around Talbot County schools of a real prescription pill next to a fake one, showing how difficult it is to tell the difference.\nTeaching the youth about the Good Samaritan Law, which protects individuals from prosecution for minor drug or alcohol offenses when calling 911 for a medical emergency, is a critical part of the prevention tactics, Goes Purple organizers said.\nIn addition, Talbot Goes Purple provides Narcan trainings and has installed Narcan boxes at several business and trained the employees how to use them. Narcan, or Naloxone, is a medication used during opioid overdoses to reverse or reduce the effects of the drug.\nThere is also a comprehensive toolkit on the Goes Purple website to help families navigate recovery services and find help regardless of insurance status.\nFor resources regarding substance use, visit talbotgoespurple.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "QAC Goes Purple 2025: standing stronger than ever\n\n September 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 709\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n QUEEN ANNE'S COUNTY \u2014 QAC Goes Purple is once again rallying the community this season to stand against substance abuse, as county leaders note progress but stress that education must continue.The countywide initiative, launched in 2017, is a collaboration of the Queen Anne's County Office of the Sheriff and the Queen Anne's County Drug-Free Coalition, in partnership with the Opioid Intervention Team and Health Department, Queen Anne's County Public Schools, the county commissioners, the Mid-Shore Community Foundation and other agencies. Its mission is to raise awareness of substance abuse and opioid overdose prevention.\nOne of the program's first actions was to place six opioid signs across the county, updated weekly to show overdose data. At the time, opioid misuse was on the rise.\nIn 2018, Queen Anne's County reported 122 overdoses and 16 overdose-related deaths. By 2024, those numbers had dropped to 18 overdoses and four deaths.\nSo far in 2025, the county has recorded eight overdoses \u2014 and no overdose deaths \u2014 an encouraging sign, officials said. But they stressed that continued education and prevention efforts are needed to keep the numbers low.\n\"Even one death due to opioids is too many, and work must continue,\" coalition members said.\nEducation, Prevention and Treatment\nThrough awareness campaigns, free Narcan distribution by the county Health Department, a standard reporting system developed by Queen Anne's County Emergency Services, and the QAC Data Dashboard, local leaders say the effort is showing results.\nIn 2025, the initiative expanded its banners across the county to more than 100, all carrying the slogan: \"Taking a stand against substance abuse.\"\nProgress is being seen \"across the board,\" said Warren Wright of QAC Goes Purple. He credited strict penalties for drug sellers, enforcement against tobacco and liquor outlets that sell to minors, and the strong work of the county's Drug Court.\nAlso contributing are Prevention Services, Peer Support Workers and the Local Management Board, which is conducting an asset-mapping project. The county Board of Education has added Bodkin life skills programs for younger students. The commissioners are working with neighboring counties to expand treatment services for residents at the Whitsitt Center.\nYouth Involvement\nRecognizing that most young people make choices about alcohol, tobacco and drug use during middle school, QAC Goes Purple has focused on youth outreach.\nA Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that more than 13% of Queen Anne's County high school students reported taking a prescription drug not prescribed to them \u2014 a troubling trend that highlights the need for early conversations at home and in schools, officials said.\nTo reach peers directly, the QAC Drug-Free Student Ambassador Program includes students from public and private schools who design posters, lead team-building events and stage award-winning activities.\n\"We believe that involvement is key to prevention for our students,\" Wright said. \"Join a team, try a club, and discover your passion. After-school programs and activities are offered through schools, the YMCA and the Giving the Edge Foundation.\"\nChanging Perceptions\nQAC Goes Purple emphasizes that substance use disorder is not a choice but a disease that affects the brain. Understanding the science of addiction, officials say, can reduce stigma and encourage compassion.\nSeptember is recognized as National Recovery Month, followed by Substance Use Prevention Month in October. International Overdose Awareness Day is marked every year on Aug. 31 to honor those lost and support families affected by substance use disorders.\n\"We can all make a difference,\" said Emily Keller, Maryland's special secretary of overdose response. \"Hundreds of lives are saved every year from bystanders who had naloxone and knew what to do in the event of an overdose. We have to make sure that anyone who wants naloxone can access it wherever they are and whenever they need it.\"\nFree naloxone is available at the Nielsen Center, 205 N. Liberty St., Centreville.\nUpcoming Event\nThe sixth annual Going Purple Together event will be held Sept. 27 at Church Hill Park from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The family-friendly gathering will feature live music, food trucks, face painting, dunk tanks and raffle prizes, while celebrating recovery and raising awareness.\nThe community is also invited to complete the QAC Goes Purple Marijuana Survey, available at the county Health Department website under the Behavioral Health tab.\n\"Everyone in Queen Anne's County can keep fighting by knowing the facts, discussing them with loved ones, colleagues and friends,\" Wright said.\nMore information is available at qacgoespurple.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Local testicular cancer survivor shoots for a hole in one\n\n September 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Amelia Blades Steward | Section: Events \n \n 867\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n According to Johns Hopkins Brady Urological Institute, testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in young men, with nearly 10,000 new diagnoses each year in the United States. It is highly curable when it first develops but can quickly spread if not treated promptly.Andrew Dorbin of Preston is a husband, father and testicular cancer survivor who hopes to educate men about the risks and symptoms of testicular cancer at the \"Putts Fore! Nuts\" miniature golf tournament on Oct. 18 from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Embers Island Mini-Golf in Ocean City. The rain date will be Oct. 25.\nDorbin was diagnosed with late-stage testicular cancer (Choriocarcinoma) in the spring of 2023. It then metastasized to his lungs and abdomen.\nWhile undergoing multiple rounds of chemotherapy, he was overwhelmed by the generosity of his family, friends and community, who rallied to support him and his family through his diagnosis and treatment. That experience of compassion and care lit a fire in him.\n\"During my longest inpatient stay at Johns Hopkins Hospital, I witnessed other patients facing their battle alone without the same support system I had. That was hard for me to stomach. It made me realize that I wanted to give back when I was able and build something that could offer strength, resources and connection to others navigating their fight against testicular cancer,\" Dorbin said.\n\"Honestly, I'm not particularly good at regular golf \u2014 I'm only there for my friend's comic relief \u2014 but I've always enjoyed miniature golf and came up with this funny tournament name on one of the sickest days of my treatment,\" he said.\nThe idea eventually grew, and Dorbin founded the Wayfinders Testicular Health Fund, a component fund of Chesapeake Charities Inc., a Maryland-based nonprofit. The fund is focused on raising awareness, providing education and building a supportive community fighting this disease.\nHe is committed to making testicular health a topic that young men are not afraid to talk about and ensuring that no one faces cancer without a community standing beside them. The tournament is the first step to accomplishing that.\n\"I chose an amazing partner in Chesapeake Charities to help make my dream a reality. The money that was used to found this venture came from what was left over from my personal GoFundMe campaign, making this essentially a 100% community-funded initiative,\" Dorbin said.\nThe fund's fundraising efforts will go toward community networking opportunities and mental health and wellness programs to ensure no one feels like they are facing the testicular cancer fight alone. Dorbin hopes his educational outreach will encourage young men to challenge the stigmas and pay attention to their health.\n\"We are encouraging our communities of young men, ages 14 to 35, to be aware of their bodies and to take action when something doesn't feel right,\" he said.\nDorbin reflects on his journey, sharing, \"My journey almost ended before it started. When I found the lump, I almost didn't act. It seems petty now, but I was worried about the cost of my health insurance deductible and thought it was nothing serious. Through the encouragement of a friend who was a nurse, I decided to get it checked out. If I had not acted as quickly as I did, I'm not sure I would be sitting here today.\"\nHe said that, like him, men in their early 20s and 30s feel they are invincible and that they will not develop any major medical issues.\n\"No one wants to go to the doctor when they are young. Also, I had never been shown how to correctly check myself for abnormalities in my testicles. Self-examination is key to early detection,\" he said.\nDorbin hopes that teens and adults will participate in the tournament while learning more about the disease and how to protect themselves and their loved ones. He shares that the event will also create community connection \u2014 helping people learn who the disease is affecting, what support people need and connecting people to resources in the community.\n\"This event is going to be a blast. Participants can expect to play two rounds of mini-golf, all while challenging their knowledge, luck, and putting skills. Hole Hecklers \u2014 professional comedians will set up a mock sports casting both at one of the miniature golf holes and roast participants as they putt. We also have a variety of prizes and awards that will make the event enjoyable for everyone. For me, the best part is that you don't have to be standing on the podium to walk away a winner,\" Dorbin said.\nIn the future, Dorbin hopes that the Wayfinders Testicular Health Fund can support outings for survivors of testicular cancer and help build a community of survivors, since many men still suffer in silence with the stigma attached to the disease.\n\"This launch would not be possible without the incredible generosity of my friends, family, and neighbors here on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Their belief in this mission, and in me, has carried me through the toughest years of my life,\" he adds.\nSponsorships are still available for the event. Registration information and sponsorship opportunities are available at wayfindersthf.org. Participants are limited, and registration will be available online on Sept. 18. Registration is non-refundable.\nFor further information, contact Andrew Dorbin at wayfindersthf@gmail.com. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Wellness center offers support for mothers on the Shore\n\n October 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 661\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The Village Maternal Holistic Wellness Center opened its doors last October to provide women on the Eastern Shore with a single, trusted source for various services.Samantha Basham Loza was inspired to create a space like this after having her first child in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. She was astounded by the lack of resources, education and community she had during this time.\n\"I was so blindsided by the entire experience, and it was really frustrating because I consider myself a highly educated person that works hard to find the right resources,\" Loza said. \"And the fact that I couldn't even find what I needed to help me at each stage of this process was just completely shocking.\"\nThe entire process of giving birth was scary for Loza. She was at a hospital in Anne Arundel County and was given an epidural that made her completely numb from her neck down, which she said caused her to have a panic attack.\nLoza said her daughter was immediately transferred to the NICU after delivery.\nBecause she was was numb from the epidural, the baby was crowning without Loza realizing or feeling it, and none of the doctors or nurses noticed. This caused Loza's daughter to have meconium aspiration syndrome. According to John's Hopkins Medicine, meconium aspiration syndrome occurs in 5 to 10% of births.\n\"I was reflecting on that entire experience thinking like, 'How is this the standard?'\" Loza said.\nWith her first child, Loza said she didn't have the knowledge base on the process of giving birth, breastfeeding or managing hormonal changes. She described the experience as isolating.\n\"We don't talk about pregnancy often enough, and how isolating it can be, and all the changes and all the sacrifices. We don't talk about fertility issues often enough. We don't talk about miscarriages enough. We don't teach any of it,\" Loza said.\nShe said her goal with the wellness center is to start these conversations and create community while doing so.\nThe center offers an array of classes and playgroups for children. There are courses for pregnant women and new moms, and the University of Maryland's obstetrics practice comes in to talk about fertility and prenatal care quarterly.\nIn addition, the wellness center has birth doulas, massage therapists, lactation consultants, a speech language pathologist, a pediatric nurse practitioner and a craniosacral therapist, who will be starting in November.\n\"A really big misconception about the name of the business, The Village Maternal Holistic Wellness Center, is that holistic means crunchy and it doesn't,\" Loza said. \"It just means we're considering you as a whole person.\"\nLoza defined a doula as a non-medical support person who provides educational, physical and emotional support during pregnancy, birth and postpartum and also helps connect clients with resources.\nThe center recently received a grant from the Talbot County Health Department to fund the training of 18 new doulas, four of whom are bilingual and two of which whom exclusively speak Spanish. The grant is also assisting the doulas with Medicaid credentialing.\nWhen Loza got pregnant with her second child, she decided to have a home birth midwife, one of the first contacts she made when looking into starting her business.\nLoza said her pregnancy and birth with her son was a completely different experience than with her daughter.\n\"It was so personal. She knew exactly where I was coming from. She knew exactly what was happening with my mental state, and what I was eating and all the things. And she always had a recommendation for a book to read, or YouTube videos to watch or things like that,\" Loza said.\n\"Though she planned to deliver at home, she was transferred to the Easton Hospital because her son's heart rate was low. Her midwife stayed by her side and advocated for her throughout the process.\nAfter having two very different birthing experiences, Loza has become passionate about educating pregnant women about the entirety of the process. She hopes to expand the centers services by opening a nonprofit arm in the near future. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She credits her doctor, Audrey Drummey, for saving her life.\nDrummey is a doctor in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Maryland Shore Medical Group in Easton. During the event, Drummey highlighted the importance of proactive genetic evaluation and early detection, especially if the disease runs in the family.\nShe emphasized the importance of access to genetic testing in health care and leveraging available resources.\nDrummy said routine mammograms should start at age 40 unless there is a family history of breast cancer in which earlier screening may be recommended and potentially covered by health insurance.\nIn addition, she said a healthy diet, regular exercise, intaking less than seven alcoholic drinks a week and breastfeeding are good preventative measures.\nFor Townsend who said she doesn't like to be vulnerable, it was important to reframe her vulnerability as a strength. As she told her story, she was nervous and emotional while recounting her experience as a breast cancer survivor.\nShe encouraged attendees to check in on their friends post-treatment saying that community is incredibly important because a diagnoses like this can instill fear and change your perspective entirely.\n\"People think that we go through this experience, and when it's over, that we're OK. And we are OK, we survived, but for your mental health it's still something where every little thing that goes wrong, there's still that fear,\" Townsend said.\nTownsend does not want others to live in fear, which is why she encourages other women \u2014 like her two sisters \u2014 to do self breast exams and early screenings. UM Shore Regional Community Health outreach specialist Catalina Billings encourages self examinations because \"no one knows your body like you do.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No public comments were offered at each of the three readings of the bill.\"Earlier this year it was identified that we have not used the proceeds of the 2019 bond issuance for renovation of the detention center. And as a result, the commissioners have directed us to reallocate the funding of the project,\" County Attorney Stewart Barroll said.In other business, the commissioners heard a proposal about a potential Hobbs Solar Project to be built on the capped landfill.Jack Martell, manager of business development, and Greg Werner, manager of Massachusetts-based Nexamp Solar, Inc. presented a slide show and answered questions from the commissioners about the proposed 5,000-panel solar project.The company proposed to \"finance, build, own and maintain\" solar facilities on 15 acres at the landfill at 26375 Hobbs Road and \"extend the financial benefits of the generated electricity, land lease and tax revenue\" to the county government and public schools.Nexamp Solar projected a total benefit of $121,152 at the end of the first year, and a total benefit at the end of its 20-year lifespan of nearly $2 million.The commissioners took no action on the proposal at this meeting.Also on the agenda was Susan Runnels, director of the Caroline Human Services Council, who discussed transportation needs and how they're currently being to serve two towns in the county.\"In my opinion, mobility on demand doesn't work in Caroline County,\" Runnels said.Few people used the service, which serves Greensboro and Federalsburg residents for in-county rides. Those towns qualify for state grant funding for transportation in lower income areas.For example, Runnels said the service, which uses Delmarva Community Transit, supplied 48 rides from Greensboro and 15 from Federalsburg from March through June. Many of those rides were called by the same persons, she said.\"I don't think this is feasible for us,\" she said. \"But we need some kind of transportation in the county we'd be better off going back to taxi service.\" Runnels said she would prefer to take almost $27,000 in state grants that she has to return to the state and use those funds to help to pay for driver's education classes for teen drivers or vehicle repairs in the target communities.\"We can't have our dollars just sitting in a parking lot waiting for a call,\" she said. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nJack Martell, left, manager of business development, and Greg Werner, manager of Massachusetts-based Nexamp Solar, Inc. present a slide show and answer questions from the Caroline County Commissioners at their Sept. 12 meeting about a proposed solar project at the Hobbs landfill. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore's office, the appointments were made in partnership with tribal leaders and councils.\nThe news release states that Bradshaw has \"lifelong ties to a range of cultural institutions and initiatives committed to supporting and promoting indigenous history.\"\nBorn in Cambridge, Bradshaw has spent his career in the agriculture, seafood and timber industries. He served on the Dorchester County Council, representing District 5, from 2014 through 2018. He served on the Maryland Heritage Areas Authority Board from 2016 to 2018.\nChief Donna Wolf Mother Abbott, of the Nause-Waiwash Band of Indians, said that she, along with other members of the Nause-Waiwash, are excited to have Bradshaw representing them.\n\"He knows what our needs are and what our concerns are,\" Abbott said. \"So we're happy to have him in that position.\"\nWhen Bradshaw got the news of the appointment, Abbott was the first person he told.\n\"I'm a historian and I learned a lot of indigenous history from her predecessor,\" Bradshaw said.\nIn his new role, Bradshaw, along with eight other appointees, will be tasked with helping to obtain state and federal recognition for the state's indigenous tribes and communities, collecting data on the contributions of the Marylands's indigenous communities and promoting awareness of those contributions.\nBradshaw said that he looks forward to working with those in education \"to teach them our history.\" He said he also looks forward to bringing attention to the needs of the tribal community.\n\"He will probably be working with different committees on hopefully getting the curriculum for the public schools system changed to include more of our history,\" Abbott said.\nBradshaw said he is excited to work with the other commissioners.\n\"I think we can accomplish some good things,\" he said.\n\"We've got a diverse representation of the tribal communities across the state.\" \n \n Caption: HEART OF CHESAPEAKE CO UNTRY HERITAGE AREA\n\n Heritage Board Vice Chair Tom Bradshaw (left) and Pat Neild, president emeritus of the South Dorchester Folk Museum, after the Museum's award from the Chesapeake Country Heritage Area was announced in 2022.

    "content": "A spacious and welcoming place - Central branch reopens main floor following a year of renovations\n\n January 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 11 | Section: News \n \n 986\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - Following a year of renovating and redesigning, the central branch of the Caroline County Public Library at 100 Market Street in the county seat reopened its first floor space Dec. 18.The soft reopening is designed to help staff fine tune details as they welcome patrons and visitors. A grand opening celebration is planned when the new elevator is finished in spring 2024.\nNew carpet, neutral walls, fresh shelving and new furniture create welcoming decor in the more open spaces of the library's main floor. The main desk is bigger and moved away from the wall, making it easier for staff members to see most of the library's interior.\nBennett said she wanted people to experience the library as \"bright, open and inviting.\"\n\"This is perfect,\" customer Romont Fletcher of Denton said Dec. 20 as he set up his laptop on the desk attached to an upholstered chair. He had not been in the library for a year and was surprised when he walked in. \"This is a great renovation,\" he said.\n\"This is good space, and it's flexible space,\" Executive Director Debby Bennett said. \"It's a well-built library.\" Bennett, who has been with the library since 1983, will retire in June 2024.\n\"In 1983, people came in, got their books and checked them out and went home,\" Bennett said. \"Now people come to stay, whether it's work on our computer, hang out with their friends in the Teen Zone, a family comes in and spends time looking for materials and just spending time here, small meetings in the study room, research in the Maryland room.\"\nThe $2.1 million renovation project began Jan. 2, 2023. Bennett, the Caroline County Board of Library Trustees and library staff met their goal of reopening the first floor to the public before Christmas.\nThe central branch has experienced many changes in its 62-year history. Card catalogs and hand-stamping due dates have been computerized. Circulating books are still a staple, but today library card holders can check out a Cricut machine, sewing machines and even fishing poles.\nThe central branch has 13,739 card holders who can check out materials, but visitors can obtain guest passes to use the public computers.\nAs if to illustrate the changes, two days after reopening, four teenaged young men checked out software to play games on library Xboxes in the Teen Zone.\nThe renovation was funded mainly by two \"highly competitive\" State Library Capital Grants, Bennett said.\nIn addition to replacing the roof slates on the library's 1995 addition, the building underwent extensive first floor renovations.\nPhase 2 includes improving the elevator in 2024.\nThe Phase 1 grant in fiscal year 2023 financed 79%, or $917,000 of the project.\nThe library board provided the local match of $244,000 from their John Hargreaves fund.\nThis phase included replacing three HVAC units at the end of their useful life, improving lighting, upgrading the emergency fire alarm system and phone system, enhancing electrical capacity for increased technology, removing the wall dividing the two children's rooms, providing a family bathroom adjacent to the children's areas, increasing seating capacity, improving sight lines and creating quiet areas. The improvements brought the library into compliance with ADA requirements.\nThe cost didn't include shelving, furniture and other additional costs that were incurred throughout the renovation, about $335,236. The library paid for those costs, except for $78,000 raised by the Friends of the Library for shelving for the adult, young adult and Maryland Room collections.\nPhase 2 is being funded by a fiscal year 2024 State Library Capital Grant that pays for 78%, or $467,000, of the project, with the remaining $132,000 provided by the Caroline County Commissioners.\nThis phase includes replacing the elevator, which is \"at the end of its useful life,\" Bennett said.\nThe new elevator will comply with ADA requirements and current codes.\nThe phase also includes replacing the addition's 4,000 square foot roof with artificial slate, which had deteriorated and become a \"serious safety hazard,\" Bennett said.\nThe elevator provides access to public space, administrative offices and the third floor attic storage area.\n\"The (two-sided) main service desk is going to work a lot better for staff to both answer basic questions and check out items, and also to be able to work with people with more complex reference questions,\" Bennett said. \"And also we have so much better visibility of the other desks and more areas of library to see who might need help (and) for security.\"\n\"Back in 1995 when we renovated and added on, we didn't have cell phones and laptops and iPads,\" Bennett said, adding that the internet was fairly new then.\n\"The MakerSpace used to be our reference area in 1995 with 7-foot shelves of reference books. Now, all the reference materials are online.\"\nMore square footage not taken up by books \"frees up more people space,\" she said.\nThere's a lot to figure out,\" Bennett said. \"Half our staff are new and didn't work down here. And for all the staff, it's a new layout. So it's a matter of figuring out procedures and ironing out all the little extra things. So opening like this without a big fanfare - and this is a quiet time of the year anyway - is giving us time to figure a lot so that things go smoothly for staff and customers.\"\n\"I've seen a lot of changes, but this library has always been innovative,\" Bennett said. \"It's always been forward-thinking and thinking: What does the community need? What does community need that they don't even know they need?\" \n \n Caption: From left are Caroline County Public Library central branch staff members Kelly Emory, Mitchell Downes, Executive Director Debby Bennett and Emerging Services Manager Vicki Burchfield.\n\n \"This is perfect,\" says Romont Fletcher of Denton regarding the newly renovated central branch of Caroline County Public Library.\n\n The Market Street entrance of Caroline County Public Library's central branch in Denton faces the courthouse.\n\n New carpet, shelving and furniture add to the fresh look of the central branch.\n\n The Teen Zone is an inviting space for gaming and online work and research. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That can also help bring more transparency to city halls, local law enforcement and school districts.\n\"The more information that we share with the public about what's happening in town, the better. We also have a live feed for all of our council, board and commission meetings. If residents aren't able to make it, they can always watch the recordings from our website,\" said Cook, mayor of Easton.\nBut social media also magnifies broader contemporary distrust of the media, government, politicians and other institutions. It can also bring rumor mills and coarse discourse.\n\"From a city perspective, we just wish people would pick up the phone and call us. We are constantly fighting the rumor mill,\" said Groves Lloyd, mayor of Lodi, Wisconsin (a small town near Madison).\nGroves Lloyd identifies herself as a \"progressive feminist\" and \"small town mayor\" on her X/Twitter account where she is no fan of former president Donald Trump. But the Wisconsin mayor said she's pulled back on her progressive posts, especially on Facebook, because of the atmosphere of social media.\nIn Montana, Nelson, the mayor of Belgrade (which has a population approaching 13,000 people), worries all the political tensions at the local level discourages candidates for office and shortens tenures for staff and officeholders. He avoids social media altogether.\n\"I'm not on Facebook. I'm not on social media,\" said Nelson. \"You can call me, or if you need me, you can text me. That's my technology.\"\nFor a more expansive look at the issue check out our story online and in our national e-edition on Monday, March 11. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Council introduces 2025 budget\n\n April 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 511\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 On Tuesday evening, the Talbot County Council voted unanimously to introduce the proposed fiscal year 2025 general fund budget of $163,970,000.The budget will include an education increase of $3.65 million from the 2024 budget.\nTalbot County Public Schools will receive $54.6 million in total funding, according to the proposed budget. This increase will go toward the capital project request for planned Chapel District Elementary School renovations and other capital projects.\nThe increase in the education budget is due, in part, to the implications of the Maryland Blueprint for Education plan. Blueprint is a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state by increasing education funding by $3.8 billion each year over the next 10 years.\n\"Maryland Blueprint required local share funding to increase by $1.053 million for FY2025 budget,\" Martha Sparks, finance director for Talbot County, said at the Tuesday meeting. \"In addition to the mandated funding, the county has included an additional appropriation of $2.6 million. Funding to support Talbot County Schools increased overall by $3.65 million above FY24 levels.\"\nEducation spending represents 37.7% of the county's total proposed budget. These numbers include Talbot County Public Schools, Chesapeake College and the Talbot County Free Library expenses.\nThe budget also allocates an additional $1.5 million in capital improvement project funding for Talbot County Public Schools to prioritize other projects.\nThe budget discussion included the option to expand the amendment of the 1-cent increase in property tax rates for public safety.\nIn November 2020, Talbot County voters approved an amendment allowing a 1-cent increase to the property tax rate to support public safety spending. This increase began in the FY2022 budget and will continue until the FY2026 budget.\nRevenues from the 1-cent increase have been used to fund 26 new public safety positions across departments, such as deputies, paramedics, emergency medical technicians and 911 operators. The funds from the amendment have allowed for inclusion of sheriff's office, paramedics/EMTs and correctional officers in enhanced retirement programs for public safety employees.\nSparks noted that the county has used more than the funds provided by the 1-cent increase to public safety.\n\"The county has used more than the revenues generated from the 1 cent to enhance public safety personnel serving the citizens and visitors of Talbot County,\" she said.\nThe council has the option to allow county residents to extend the 1-cent increase beyond FY2026 through a ballot initiative for voters in the November 2024 general election.\nClay Stamp, county manager for Talbot County, expressed his admiration for the county's finance team for their work on the budget.\n\"There's a lot of hard work that went into drafting the FY 25 proposed balanced budget,\" Stamp said. \"While we're here tonight, I want to thank the council for your cooperation and support over the last number of months.\"\nTwo public hearings will be held to gather community input before final approval.\nA public hearing will be held on May 7 at 2 p.m. in the Talbot County Courthouse and at 7 p.m. in the Easton Elementary School cafeteria, located at 307 Glenwood Avenue. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County commissioners discuss FY 2025 budget, years ahead\n\n May 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 878\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 On May 7 the Caroline County Commissioners convened to present the fiscal year 2025 budget, but the budget discussion looked at what's to come in years ahead.Discussions featured two prominent, long-term issues \u2014 the county's revenue-generating landfill and the state-mandated Blueprint for Education program.\nThe budget overview also covered the operating budget, capital budgets, proposed tax rates and municipal real property tax differential rates.\nLooking forward, Commissioner Larry Porter said The Mid-Shore II Regional Landfill will generate $420,000 a year in revenue if it stays in Caroline County.\nIn the late 1980s, due to new federal regulations, the counties had to close their landfills and replace them with new landfills. In response to this new regulation, Talbot, Caroline and Queen Anne's counties engaged with MES to form a partnership where each county would take turns hosting a landfill for a 20-year term. Kent County later joined that partnership.\nCaroline County is hosting the current landfill and, under the original arrangement, would be off the hook at the end of 2030 when Queen Anne's County would take over the responsibility of host. However, the partnering counties have agreed to allow the landfill to stay in Caroline County for 12 years longer than initially planned.\nDan Fox, deputy administrator, said the county will receive a revenue increase of around $12.3 million over the duration of the extended agreement at a meeting held earlier on May 7. The counties agreed on a $3 per ton post fee until 2030. In 2031 it will rise to $6.\n\"Landfill is a revenue benefit to the county. Down the road, we will need this money,\" Porter said.\nThe other topic discussed by commissioners was the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a massive educational program that includes salary increases for teachers and more funding for early education.\nThe commissioners are concerned about its expense to the county.\nWhile dramatically boosting state funding for public education over a decade, the Blueprint also asks local school districts \u2014 and taxpayers \u2014 to do their part.\nIn a letter to Gov. Wes Moore, the Maryland Association of Counties last November listed a litany of concerns. They said the Blueprint's cost estimates don't take into account the bottom-line local impact of several major spending items, including construction costs for additional classrooms needed under the plan's expansion of pre-K and the new minimum $60,000 teacher salary starting in 2026.\n\"It is a bad program and we have to figure out a way to pay for this,\" Porter said.\nEducation-related expenses made up the top expenditure for Caroline County in FY 2025. The Board of Education will receive about $17.1 million if the proposed budget is approved, about $2.3 million more than last year.\nRounding out the top four expenditures are the sheriff ($5,534,994), corrections ($5,889,769) and emergency medical services ($5,563,069).\nThe top three revenue generators for fiscal year 2025 are property taxes ($28,704,000), income taxes ($20,200,000) and a disparity grant from the state ($4,686,791).\nThough commissioners voted to maintain the same tax rates as last year, the county will bring in more revenue from property taxes in FY 2025 due to an increase in the assessed value of properties in Caroline County.\nBecause of this increase, the state will provide less funding to the county in its annual disparity grant.\nAccording to the Maryland Department of Legislative Services, the disparity grant is \"where the local income tax is below 75% of the statewide average. Under the program each eligible jurisdiction receives a grant that enables the per capita local income tax revenues to reach 75% of the statewide average.\"\nDeputy Administrator Dan Fox said that our state disparity grant is being funded at $615,525 less than last year.\n\"That is a state-driven formula that is based off of wealth. We changed in percentage there, which means we receive less money this year,\" Fox said.\nThe tax differential rate was discussed for various municipalities.\nPorter described the tax differential as \"revenue that the county does not collect. It is not money being taken from the towns or given to the towns. It does not affect town budgets in any way. It is money that the town does not collect.\"\nFox said, \"The county is looking to maintain the property tax rate at 98 cents per 100 of all unincorporated areas as well as the towns that do not receive a differential,\" he said.\n\"This year we are looking provide Denton with the same tax rate as the prior year with 92 cents- a six cents differential to get you to 92 cent county tax rate. Federalsburg will have a county tax rate of 90 cents. Greensboro will remain at 92 cents. Preston would receive and remain at 97 cents and Ridgely would be at 93 cents,\" said Fox.\nCommissioner Frank Bartz said they go through the budget line by line. And although there were some conversations, by and large they agreed on each item.\nTwo people Sue Simmons, interim director of Caroline County Arts Council and Dr. Cliff Coppersmith, President of Chesapeake College, both came up and stated how grateful they were for the county's support.\nThey had scheduled an hour and a half for this meeting, but it only took around 45 minutes. One commissioner, Travis Breeding, was \"under the weather\" and did not attend live.\nThe FY 2025 budget is scheduled for potential adoption during the Commissioners of Caroline County meeting on May 28. \n\n (c) Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS \u2014 On Monday morning, many community members gathered for the ribbon cutting ceremony for an approximately $4.5 million renovation project to help serve the community of St. Michaels.The St. Michaels Community Center has been operating for over 30 years and has provided various supports through community pantries, events, senior and adult programs, youth programs and community gardens.\nLori Morris, the center's board chair, said she is excited to continue serving the community 2,500 meals a week and distributing groceries to neighbors in need.\n\"The outstanding center staff, both past and current, many of whom are here, not only provided ongoing input to the design and construction process but kept as many of our programs running as possible while we were out of the building,\" Morris said.\nThe approximately 5,700-square-foot building now houses a modern commercial kitchen, two classrooms, a technology center, a gallery and upstairs offices for staff. The main level of the building will serve multiple uses, including cafe seating, a space for speakers or performances and a place where people can pick up items from the center's community pantry.\nThe 800-square-foot commercial kitchen will serve the new Culinary Arts & Hospitality Workforce Development Program and the center's Community Cafe, which serves chef-made meals free of charge to anyone experiencing food insecurity.\nThe two classrooms on the other side of the gallery will be used primarily for children's programming but also for adult programs.\nA technology center will have desks and computers for different organizations and nonprofits.\nDuring the ribbon cutting ceremony, Morris praised her predecessor Langley Shook, former chair of the board of directors.\nMorris said that Shook's leadership was the foundation of the project. The renovation was his vision, and he and his wife, Karen Shook, threw themselves into the fundraising, representing the committee before the town commissioners and the Historic District Committee.\nShook spoke about the work that many put into the project and thanked everyone involved in making the community center what it is today.\n\"The programs have been expanded, the staff has been strengthened,\" Shook said. \"Our fundraising has made this platform possible and successful, and I think our greatest days are yet to come.\"\nOne of the speakers, State Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), requested that all people who had attended St. Michaels Middle or High School come to stand with him as he presented the St. Michaels Community Center board of directors a citation in recognition for the work that was put into the community project.\n\"Because we do citations and we do projects, and it's part of the government doing something, but this is the will of the people,\" Mautz said. \"This is what the town needed. This is what the town wanted, and by golly, this is what the town was going to get. So it's a great day for everybody.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This center offers year-round comprehensive early care, education and family support to children from birth to 3 years of age, as well as their families.\nMary Kay Verdery, grants administrator for Talbot County, gave opening remarks outside of the center.\nVerdery told community members the renovated space, including classrooms for up to 65 infants and toddlers, office space, kitchen and laundry facilities for the program, was possible due to the grant the center received.\nMaria Maguire, health officer for the Talbot County Health Department, gave a speech noting the significance of Head Start programs for the community, including research showing that children enrolled in Early Head Start programs have better social-emotional language and cognitive development.\n\"All babies and toddlers need positive early learning experiences to foster their intellectual, social and emotional development and to lay the foundation for later school success,\" Maguire said. \"Talbot County Health Department's Early Head Start program offers daily, year-round services to families and young children in Talbot County. It provides a comprehensive array of services, including mental health, education, housing, referrals and linkages to health services.\"\nCommunity partners and members were given a tour of the center, where they were greeted by staff and children enjoying the care and benefits of the program.\nAfterward, people enjoyed refreshments and baked goods before heading to the next stop on the grant project tour, the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center Kitchen and Community Space.\nThis full restoration of a brick warehouse provides the resource center with a much-needed space for small groups, class opportunities and community gatherings.\nAdding a full commercial kitchen will allow small food businesses to expand their economic impact on the community and provide an appropriate space to create meals and food options for the community.\nTalbot County Councilmember Pete Lesher, vice president of the council, shared the council's enthusiasm and gratitude for the community space and renovations made by the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center.\n\"This is an organization that has an important mission to a growing part of our population in this community,\" Lesher said. \"Thanks to all of you who are already doing that. Thanks to the rest of you who have helped to make this project possible.\"\nAttendees were welcomed to a feast of Pakistani food created by Veronica Guevara, who used the kitchen to help launch her catering business. People enjoyed a delicious array of lentils, fresh strawberry salad, seasoned chicken and fluffy naan. Guevara explained each dish and showed the best way for attendees to eat it.\nMatthew Peters, director of Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, described this project as a \"labor of love.\"\n\"So we've got that whole new growth take, and all really thanks to having a little bit more space to breathe and to get people together like this provided to the community,\" Peters said. \"And hopefully, we keep finding more and more of our clients that are those secret gems so that I can create an amazing mission to share. So thank you all.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Local agencies need money from ENOUGH Act now\n\n July 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPHEN RIDEOUT | Section: Columns \n \n 607\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Governor's Office on Children recently released information about the ENOUGH Act that was passed in this most recent legislative session. The goals of this legislation are right in line with what communities need eventually to address child poverty and program needs in significant ways but place the achievement of those goals a long way off for many jurisdictions and in particular the jurisdictions that are in the greatest need.The implementation plans for communities and nonprofit organizations expect that there are organizations in our communities that have strong leadership, possibly an executive director, an engaged board of directors, strong community support with volunteers and funding. There is an expectation that they are ready to take on a new initiative even while they are stretched to support their existing programs and goals.\nAs I have been on the grants committee for the Mid Shore Community Foundation and on the board of another foundation that gives out over $250,000 a year to programs supporting women and children, I understand that there are some programs that are not funded for a variety of reasons or receive minimal support. We need to find a way to support these start up organizations now rather than have them wait, possibly for years, if ever, before they can make the grade to be funded by the ENOUGH Act.\nWhat the ENOUGH Act expects is that the money will go to those nonprofits that have their act together and meet all of the requirements that the Office on Children places on them. They are willing to help them develop and grow that capacity, but many of the groups doing great work in a community are small, understaffed and underfunded. As a result, they will take years, if ever, to become organized to be able to begin making a larger difference in their community for children and families.\nI have encouraged a different manner of funding programs for children and families that would bring a funding stream of smaller amounts to communities that have high poverty rates and need programs for summer and after school or reading for children to help communities right now with the significant needs that exist, especially in rural areas.\nThe funding would come directly to a city, town, or county based on existing data about the needs in that community. The local town or county council or Local Management Board would identify good programs that are underfunded but making a difference in their community and, with the help of the Governor's Office on Children, collect data that will show what the outcomes are from the money that is being spent.\nThe city, town or county or a Local Management Board could be the data collector for reporting purposes to the Governor's Office. Providing the funding, which would not have to be that much, could help to help the community identify and build the kind of nonprofit infrastructure that would be able to apply for and be funded as the larger and better funded programs will be supported by the ENOUGH Act.\nWithout funding to jump start communities that do not now have the resources to successfully apply for ENOUGH Act funding or can apply for funds to develop a collaboration, some communities that desperately need this help will never receive it, and we will see even more children continue down a path that will limit their ability to achieve in school and have successful lives.\nSending the funding to the city, town or county or the LMB based on need and existing data will help now not years in the future, and now is when it is needed.\nStephen Rideout is mayor of Cambridge.

A request from the county's public works department to award funds for that temporary relocation was made to Talbot County Council on Tuesday.The request was to award Bates Moving and Storage Company the moving and storage contract for just over $100,000. Council members voted unanimously in favor of the request.\n\"Bates has a lot of experience with moving library collections. They've done a number of libraries on the Eastern Shore as well as media centers,\" Dana Newman, director of Talbot County Free Library, said. \"And they have a special way of packing up library materials so that it's kept in order, and that it's stored in conditions that are okay for storing books over a long period of time.\"\nNewman said the collections will be moved to a temporary location in St. Michaels as renovations are completed. \"It does sound like a lot of funds needed for this, but it is a specialized process, if you can imagine trying to keep about 20,000-plus library materials in strict duodecimal order,\" Newman told the council.\nThe storage will last for around 15 months, during which they will not be available to be checked out. The move will begin around late October. Council members expressed support for the request.\n\"I'm excited that you're getting to the point that you're moving everything,\" Council Member Keasha Haythe said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In some ways, that fiscal pressure has increased since.Michael Sanderson, the executive director of the Maryland Association of Counties, briefed the Talbot County Council on those financial troubles and more during a special meeting Tuesday.\nHe told council members a budget shortfall of potentially $600 to $800 million could be facing lawmakers in Annapolis. Fixing that is \"not easy, but not impossible,\" he said.\n\"There are a couple of years of that in our forecast, and then it gets really serious,\" Sanderson said.\nWhen fiscal year 2028 arrives, Sanderson warned that the state will run out of money in its trust fund that's been used for The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's expansive and optimistic education initiative.\nMany counties have been under significant financial pressure due to state requirements stemming from Blueprint. Sanderson says the state will be feeling that level of pressure soon.\n\"The counties are feeling it now,\" he said. \"The state doesn't really feel it for a couple years down the road, and that has been a meaningful disconnect.\"\nWithout significant timeline adjustments for Blueprint from the state, MACo feels there will continue to be that disconnect between the fiscal situation of the state versus the situation counties are facing. State funding for transportation, though, is already causing serious impacts, Sanderson said.\n\"The canary in the coal mine that's already chirping is in transportation,\" he told the council members. \" \u2026 The conversation in the summer time is sometimes ambiguous and hazy and that sort of thing. But this year, not so much. They were just saying, 'If there aren't already shovels in the ground, we can't afford the next thing.'\"\nThe Maryland Department of Transportation has been forced to delay many statewide projects amid a significant budget deficit. Earlier this month, the department released a draft plan that showed $1.3 billion in cuts from the state's six-year transportation plan.\nSanderson noted the \"state's transportation challenge is not a function of the Key Bridge\" rebuild, which is set to begin next year.\nAt the county level, council Vice President Pete Lesher said Talbot County is \"finding itself in a slightly different place\" than others.\n\"We are going through a number of capital construction projects, our health department, our sheriff's office, our 911 center,\" Lesher said, emphasizing some of those projects are receiving \"pandemic-era related funds\" from the federal government.\n\"The pinch that a lot of counties are feeling right now, the income tax, is not yet being felt in Talbot County,\" Lesher said. \"We can look around at our neighbors and see what is coming, even though we are not yet in that position now.\"\nLesher thanked Sanderson and MACo President Johnny Olszewski Jr. for their work to represent the counties at the state level year-round.\n\"We know that we are stronger together in Annapolis,\" Lesher said. \"And we see every year what a powerful voice MACo is for all of us jointly.\" \n\n Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge candidates talk local issues at candidate forum\n\n October 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 936\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Cambridge \u2014 Cambridge City Council candidates and the city's residents flowed in and out of the Chesapeake Grove Intergenerational Center Saturday afternoon for a nearly five-hour candidate forum conducted by the League of Women Voters.Ten of the 14 commissioner and mayoral candidates running in the Oct. 19 election were at the forum.\nThe forum was split into three sessions for the different races. Ryan Anthony of the Cambridge Spy, Sharon Smith of the Cambridge Association of Neighborhoods, Jim Johnson of the Dorchester Star and Jim Brady of WHCP moderated the forum.\nWard 2 candidate Jenna LeCompte, Ward 4 candidate Dave Cannon, Ward 3 candidate Frank Stout and Ward 5 candidate Brian Roche \u2014 who is running uncontested \u2014 were not at the event.\nIn an email to WHCP on Friday, LeCompte said she is \"taking a step back\" from her campaign and would not be at the event. She did not respond to requests for clarification from the Star Democrat on what that means.\nMAYORAL FORUM\nSandwiched between two commissioner candidate sessions, the mayoral forum gave candidates Lajan Cephas, Andrew Bradshaw and La-Shon Banks-Foster the opportunity to share their perspectives on an array of Cambridge issues, from the waterfront, to revitalizing the city's downtown, to race relations.\nDuring the session, candidates were asked whether the city should get more involved in Dorchester County Public Schools, which is one of Maryland's lowest ranked school systems.\nBradshaw said he would like to implement a mentorship program, which would reach across racial and socioeconomic lines, and encourage the Board of Education to implement a charter school program. He said charter schools across the state tend to perform at the state average, which is \"significantly better\" than Dorchester schools.\n\"And they are only located in counties and jurisdictions with poor performance,\" he said, \"so there's corollaries where they can succeed in places like Cambridge.\"\nFoster, who attended the forum virtually, said every graduate from Dorchester County high schools is a county resident and could be a Cambridge resident.\n\"We cannot ignore the fact that whoever graduates from either of the schools that I mentioned can and will impact the City of Cambridge, and we must have an active role,\" she said.\nCephas said it is important for the city to be \"extremely supportive\" of the county, but there is no need to \"reinvent the wheel.\" She said there are nonprofits already in place to address education concerns.\n\"So it's extremely important that we understand what's already in place, support those nonprofits that are already in place, and each of us just pick up a book and read to someone,\" she said.\nCOMMISSIONER FORUMS\nThe seven commissioner candidates at the forum were split into two groups. All commissioner candidates were asked the same questions from the moderators.\nKicking off the event were Ward 1 candidates Brett Summers and Laurel Atkiss, as well as Ward 3 candidate Gary Gordy. Ward 2 candidates Jermaine Anderson, Shay Lewis-Sisco and Nancy Jackson, as well as Ward 4 candidate Sputty Cephas, closed out the event.\nWhen asked about code enforcement and overall housing quality in the city, Summers said hiring tenant advocates to promote a tenants bill of rights would be beneficial.\n\"Because if the tenants feel like they can contact the city inspector and have them come out without fear of getting evicted or some other kind of retribution, then the tenants are empowered to improve our housing stock,\" he said.\nAtkiss said the city has implemented a software system to make it easier to enforce things like building code violations. She said Cambridge is doing city-wide building inspections and recently hired a new code enforcement officer.\n\"We've invested money, we've invested time,\" she said, \"and now we're going to invest the manpower, and we're going to start to see some results that I hope everybody's going to be really happy with.\"\nLewis-Sisco said code enforcement should strategically target houses where renters are living in deplorable conditions. She said community engagement should also be a focus.\n\"So that when code enforcement officers go out to a homeowner or a property, they are able to offer those additional supports or let them know what additional resources exist,\" she said.\nThe issue of addressing crime in Cambridge was also brought up during the forum.\nGordy said improved lighting, more cameras and more monitoring of those cameras are needed in the city's \"hot spots\" in order to lower crime rates. When talking about monitoring cameras, he brought up a shooting that occurred over the weekend.\n\"Because last night police got there so fast, but they couldn't see who it was,\" he said about the need for 24-hour camera monitoring.\nJackson said addressing the issue of crime in Cambridge might start with more than detaining people. She said she would work to help resolve those problems if elected.\n\"There is something deep where this person is committing these acts,\" she said. \"It could be the home life or it could be the environment.\"\nCephas said strengthening the police department's community policing division is important. He talked about programming for youth to attract \"local and diverse talent\" as another solution.\n\"Let's do a cadet program to get some of these young people before they get out into the community and do wrong things or bad things,\" he said.\nAnderson said these problems have existed for a long time and won't be a quick fix. He stressed the importance of being proactive and communicating.\nWhen asked about the greatest threat to the city, both Atkiss and Anderson talked about the city standing in its own way.\n\"But the biggest opportunity is imagine if we get out of our own way,\" Anderson said. \"Think about the opportunity that would pose for this city ... how much of a difference that would make.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Many of our grants cross fiscal years, so we must adjust the revenues to match the expenditures that were actually seen at year end,\" Hignutt said.\nThen she shifted the attention to expenditures like driver salaries for transportation. Between fuel costs and bus driver salaries, the school system overspent about $39,000. She also mentioned parking lot repavement projects and classroom renovations.\nThere was a $5,782,498 surplus noted in the total budgeted revenues. According to Daniel Fox, deputy county administrator, the excess of revenue over expenditures is retained by the Board of Education to go to its fund balance.\nThe commissioners approved the amended budget.\nEMPLOYEE ADVISORY BOARDNext up was the Employee Advisory Board, an authority that overlooks the corrections, emergency services, planning and codes, public works, recreation and parks, and administration departments. There is also a non-voting member department, the Department of Human Resources.\nTodd Lord, chairman of the Advisory Board for Caroline County, thanked the commissioners for improving pensions for retirees and achieving competitive pay increases to help with recruitment and retention.\nThe board also wants cost of living adjustments due to the inflation following the pandemic.\nLord proposed an initiative to go forward as he hears from staff about pay and salaries.\n\"We recommend merit pay increases annually for step based off of employee evaluations. We want to get away from the bunching of salaries. Health care plans for retirees, that is another one of our initiatives being discussed heavily in departments,\" Lord said.\nHe said the goal was to increase retention and have attraction for the employees under the board's care.\n\"Right now we want to provide a health care plan that employees can take into retirement,\" Lord said. \"Having their pension in retirement would be a huge benefit in retention for our staff.\"\nCommissioner Frank Bartz responded, \"Health care for retirees, that is a hard undertaking for the county.\"\nAnother commissioner said the same.\nPorter said, \"I don't foresee that we are going to be able to do health care benefits for people who are retiring at 55. The same inflation figures that you are using, we are facing as well.\"\nPresident Travis Breeding said, \"We have to find that balance \u2014 taking care of our employees and taking care of our tax payers and the constituents of the county.\"\nPUBLIC WORKS REORGANIZATIONRobin Eaton, director of the Department of Public Works, asked the commissioners for the authority to reorganize the department to create a project manager position. He spoke of maintaining the 80 miles of dirt roads in the county.\n\"Our original structure had three crew leaders, so doing away with one of those crew leader positions and creating a project inspector slash utility locator,\" Eaton said.\n\"It is actually three crews. Two under crew leaders and one dirt road crew with four employees under the road superintendent,\" Kathleen Freeman, county administrator, said.\nThe commissioners approved the reorganization. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said. \"There needs to be a structural, fundamental change.\"\nMautz and Dels. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico), Chris Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) all spoke at the chamber lunch. They, along with the rest of the state's legislators, will head back to Annapolis in January for the 447th session of the Maryland General Assembly.\nIn talking about the state's budget, Mautz also said there should be incentives in place to try to drive state agencies to save money.\nSample-Hughes said the state should do its fiscal homework and find out what it \"really (has) to work with.\"\n\"But I do believe that we can still address and attack some of these goals that we have, whether it's education, whether it's climate, whether it's criminal justice,\" she said. \"We can do it in a pragmatic way.\"\nAdams said to solve the budget problem, the state has to leverage and grow its private sector.\n\"You do not do what we've done for the past two years,\" he said. He said the state and its leadership need to stop spending so much, own up to the problem and stop blaming it on COVID-19.\nHutchinson expressed his concerns with the transportation budget and the lack of funding for many infrastructure projects across the state.\n\"We've got to pay attention to our transportation budget,\" he said.\nBLUEPRINTThe legislators also talked about the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state through increasing education funding by $3.8 billion over a 10-year period.\nSample-Hughes said although Blueprint's goals are important, the General Assembly's decision to pass the plan has contributed to the state's budget deficit. She later advocated for giving more resources to the nonprofits that already serve 3 and 4 year olds, rather than putting money toward expanding early childhood education in the state's public school systems.\nMautz said he thinks the project needs to be paused so that the plan's strengths and weaknesses can be better evaluated.\nJUVENILE CRIMEThe legislators also talked about the state of juvenile crime in Maryland, with Sample-Hughes calling for the removal of Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi.\nHutchinson said that with recent juvenile justice reforms going into effect Nov. 1, he doesn't think a lot of legislators are going to want to discuss juvenile crime this upcoming session.\n\"Because they'll say, 'We just put that in place. We haven't even been able to see the results,'\" he said.\nAdams said law enforcement is needed now more than ever and officers need to be able to do their jobs.\n\"If you want a society, if you want a City of Cambridge, if you want an Eastern Shore (or) State of Maryland, if you want a United States that is civil, there have to be consequences,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If passed at a future meeting, they will approve a combined $1.5 million in funding for three projects: new auditorium lights at Easton High School ($817,321), light replacements at St. Michaels Middle High School ($556,000) and athletic field improvements across the district ($116,679).\nThe fiscal year 2025 budget already accounted for the capital costs, County Manager Clay Stamp noted. The three bills would simply authorize the usage of funds for those three projects, respectively.\nTalbot County Public Schools Director of Operations Kevin Shafer said Easton High's auditorium lights date back to the school's renovation in 1997.\nTalbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher said he's noticed \"how desperately needed this lighting system is.\"\n\"In order to put on some of the really quality student productions that we've seen at Easton High School, I believe that some of the lighting directors have been bringing equipment in from \u2026 the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and other places to supplement the antiquated equipment that the auditorium itself has,\" Lesher said.\n\"We've moved into an era of LED lighting, which didn't exist back in 1997,\" Lesher added. \"This is going to be a huge leap forward.\"\nShafer said the light replacements and improvements at St. Michaels Middle High School will complete the ongoing LED conversion product across the entire St. Michaels campus. Grant funding allowed for new side lights at St. Michaels Elementary, Shafer said.\nThe $117,000 for athletic field improvements will help the district move forward with its grass field upgrades.\n\"Generally speaking, the athletic field improvements are going to be surrounding the current fields that we have, grass fields,\" Shafer said. \"(We are) doing some longstanding improvements related to some issues or concerns that came up.\"\nA public hearing on the three bills will be held during Talbot County Council's Feb. 11 meeting at 5:30 p.m. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Similar bills have been filed for many years and have not passed, with counties largely complaining about the cost of implementation.\nThis year's bill would mandate that every school bus made, brought or built after 2027 must have a seatbelt installed on every seat.\nThe county commissioners said they would have a conversation with Caroline County Public Schools about the bill, but they expressed concerns about the potential cost of enacting it.\n\"I don't think I'm interested in testifying,\" Larry Porter said about a request he received to oppose the legislation. \"But I think we could probably reach out to the superintendent because there were some concerns from their transportation department about it.\"\nThe concerns for the County Commissioners have been the same every time this measure has been proposed \u2014 the cost of installing seat belts on every school bus, who is liable if the kids don't put seatbelts on and how the school bus drivers will enforce seatbelt wearing.\n\"We have the same concerns that we had before,\" Porter said at the Tuesday meeting.\nIn an interview, Commission President Travis Breeding mentioned but he believes the design of the seats on the bus helps keep students safe without seatbelts.\nEMINENT DOMAINThe county is more receptive to eminent domain bill, but they want to see some revisions before it's passed.\n\"The eminent domain bill was prohibiting the state or county from taking land by eminent domain in areas that were preservation areas,\" Porter said. \"In the ...",

She was one of many vendors who had previously attended the event not to distribute resources, but to receive them.\n\"It's really refreshing to be able to give back,\" Jefferson said. \"Just a couple years ago, I was somebody that was coming through the doors and receiving services myself, so it's good to see that we can help families in need.\"\nThe Caroline Cares Community Resource Day featured around 40 vendors providing information, help and food to the community.\n\"This is what it's all about,\" said Stephanie Johnson, His Hope Ministries' executive director and board member for Resources Day. \"Just getting all the resources in one building so that it can be kind of an easily accessible for those who need them the most. Being able to bring those providers under one roof, on a specific day, to get those services out to everybody who needs them is huge.\"\nOne of the main focuses for Resource Day is providing many different types of help for many different people.\nSome attendees face expenses they can't afford or are just in a bad financial situation, and some people are homeless. Resources Day helped with a variety of situations.\nDirectors expect 100 to 150 county residents experiencing homelessness to attend Resources Day every year, and they have a plan to make sure homeless residents can find shelter.\n\"With this particular event, they have access to walk around, talk to the vendors and see what exactly what their services are that they provide,\" Johnson said. \"However, like when it comes to those who are actually experiencing homelessness, we have a separate room set aside for them to really dig into what their needs are and see how we can connect them with services.\"\nCaroline County Public Schools officials attended, providing information for children on enrollment in school and many different resources for mental and physical health. United4Caroline provided free diapers for families with infants.\nChesapeake College's nursing program provided free blood pressure checks for all people in attendance. Nursing students gained experience and enjoyed serving the community.\n\"Oh, I love this, and I'm actually from Denton myself, so to give back to the community is amazing,\" Katie Reuwer, an assistant professor at Chesapeake College, said. \"It's a great experience for the students to really learn about community service and helping others. I've already had some really good feedback from the students about how much they enjoy it.\"\nStaff from Studio 107 Hair Salon in Kent Island and Edwards All Star Barbershop in Denton enjoyed providing free haircuts and styles at Resource Day, something both shops provide every year.\n\"There's no better feeling,\" Lisa Milligan, owner of Studio 107, said. \"You're helping people that are maybe down on their luck or they're just getting out of jail or they're just going for jobs. It's every aspect, older people that can't afford to get their hair cut especially in this economy. So it's great to give back.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025",

    "content": "Sen. Van Hollen talks federal grants pause with Eastern Shore legislators\n\n February 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 758\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n While speaking with Eastern Shore legislators Friday morning, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said a short-lived pause of federal funding earlier this week had impacts on local organizations such as fire stations and law enforcement agencies.Monday, President Donald Trump's budget office issued a memorandum ordering a pause on federal grants and loans. A U.S. district judge temporarily blocked the pause Tuesday before the White House rescinded the memo the following day.\n\"Because of the public outcry, they did pull back on this overall freeze,\" Van Hollen said. \"But there's still a whole lot of uncertainty and confusion. So if you are hearing from folks on the Eastern Shore that are recipients of federal programs that are being disrupted, please let us know.\"\nAt the weekly Eastern Shore Delegation meeting, Del. Steven Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) asked Van Hollen to elaborate on his perspective of what happened.\nVan Hollen said the memo from the Office of Management and Budget brought forth confusion for government agencies. The senator heard from thousands that were impacted, he said in an email newsletter.\n\"It was very broadly worded and very ambiguous,\" Van Hollen said. \"Federal agencies interpreted this based on what it said. Essentially, they did freeze a lot of ongoing payments to organizations that do important community work.\"\nArentz said some of the spending that was paused could be viewed as \"questionable\" in the first place.\n\"I think that's the point that was being made about that,\" Arentz said. \"I keep getting questions on it, because it does look like when you portray it in one way, it looks bad, but in the other way, you look at some spending that people would have questions on. And I think that's part of the explanation I try to give.\"\n\"The way the memo was worded and the reason it was retracted was because it was so broad that it appeared to impact everybody,\" Van Hollen responded.\nSen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) also attended Friday's Eastern Shore Delegation meeting. She explained to state senators and delegates her line of thinking when voting to confirm recent political appointees, emphasizing that she is prepared to vote on \"qualified\" candidates across party lines.\n\"My primary interest and sole interest, really, is making sure that I protect the interests of Maryland,\" Alsobrooks said.\nSUPERINTENDENTSEastern Shore superintendents gathered at the meeting Friday to provide legislative requests and recommendations.\nCaroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons, president of the Eastern Shore of Maryland Educational Consortium superintendents' group, framed Friday's discussion around The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education funding initiative.\nIt comes as Gov. Wes Moore (D) and the state legislature attempt to balance a $3 billion state deficit, in part by making cuts to education funding.\nDorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson explained the importance for districts to attract a diverse and qualified teacher workforce. However, state requirements, such as teacher salary minimums, sometimes bring about challenges.\n\"It is not good for a district, especially like mine, since we don't have the funding that other districts have,\" Thompson said.\nQueen Anne's County Public Schools Superintendent Patty Saelens said the Eastern Shore superintendents don't support Moore's proposed funding cuts to teacher collaborative time (out-of-classroom time to grade and plan) and community school initiatives.\n\"Our number one priority right now that we just can't support is literal cuts to our budget, specifically as it relates to the collaborative time and the community schools,\" Saelens said. \"Those are two major things that will negatively impact our overall state support.\"\nEDUCATIONRepresentatives from colleges and universities attended Friday's meeting, including Chesapeake College President Clifford Coppersmith and Washington College President Mike Sosulski.\nSosulski provided an update on Washington College's Innovation Plant Project, which is a project the institution is collaborating with Chesapeake College on.\n\"In the year-and-a-half of its development, it's already garnered $3 million in public and private funding to support it,\" Sosulski said.\nSosulski added that he hopes the Maryland Sellinger Grant Program, which provides independent colleges and universities with state funding, isn't slashed.\n\"I can't tell you how important Sellinger has been to making a Washington College education affordable and accessible to all Maryland residents,\" he said. \"It is really, and quite literally, the difference for many, many of our students and their ability to achieve the kind of education that we can provide.\"\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) asked about whether universities are considering raising tuition due to potential state funding cuts.\n\"We fully understand the need for the governor to cut the budget,\" said University of Maryland Eastern Shore President Heidi Anderson. \"We will not be looking at increasing tuition for our students, and we will abide by that.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From crushes to banning cell phones \u2014 Maryland lawmakers propose new legislation covering range of issues\n\n February 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 654\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Maryland state senators and delegates have introduced a variety of bills in the 2024 legislative session, addressing issues ranging from state symbols and education mandates to law enforcement policy and budget concerns.State Symbols and Utility RegulationsState Sen. Steve Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) has introduced Senate Bill 562, which would designate the original Maryland Orange Crush as the state cocktail. The bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Wicomico, Worcester).\nHershey also sponsored Senate Bill 561, which, along with House Bill 227 sponsored by Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), would allow electric cooperatives to use unclaimed funds only to assist cooperative members or donate to nonprofit organizations, rather than treating them as abandoned property.\nAdditionally, Hershey introduced Senate Bill 355, seeking to delay the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program by two years.\nEnergy and Education LegislationDel. Jeff Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) is behind two bills on solar energy regulation: House Bill 739 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 478) and House Bill 742. One bill would prohibit the use of eminent domain for solar siting, while the other would return control over solar development to county governments.\nGhrist also introduced House Bill 736, which seeks to remove the mandate requiring local school systems to offer pre-kindergarten for three-year-olds. Another provision in the bill would increase state funding to help Kent County construct a new middle school.\nOn law enforcement, Ghrist is supporting a bill \u2014 potentially House Bill 122 \u2014 that would require the removal of unfounded complaints from police personnel files.\nNursing, Historic Preservation, and Cemetery ProtectionsDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) has proposed House Bill 602 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 407), directing the State Board of Nursing to negotiate reciprocity agreements with neighboring states for advanced practice nursing licensure. Another measure, House Bill 616 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 421), would extend the statute of limitations for crimes related to cemetery destruction and prohibit damaging cemetery landscaping. The bill is co-sponsored by Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico).\nHutchinson is also behind House Bill 760, which would establish a local appeals process for Maryland Historic Trust decisions.\nBudget Deficit Shifts to CountiesGov. Wes Moore's proposed budget shifts some of the state's structural deficit onto county governments. Ghrist criticized the move, stating that counties did not contribute to the deficit but are now being forced to compensate for state overspending.\n\"For my district, $720,000 will be shifted to Caroline County on top of an additional $1.8 million more that the county will have to add to education under Kirwan mandates,\" Ghrist stated. He cited similar financial burdens for other Eastern Shore counties, including Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne's.\n\"This will stifle economic growth because people will be sending more of their hard-earned money to the government rather than spending it in their local economies,\" Ghrist added.\nLaw Enforcement and Traffic StopsA controversial proposal, Senate Bill 292, has drawn strong opposition from law enforcement officials, including Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker. The bill would reclassify certain primary traffic offenses as secondary offenses, preventing law enforcement from stopping drivers solely for those violations.\n\"These minor traffic violations could actually lead to catching suspects that have committed serious felonies, recovering firearms, and stopping drug-related crimes,\" Baker said. A hearing on the bill is scheduled before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee.\nOther Bills of Local InterestHouse Bill 28, sponsored by Del. Josh Bouchat (R-Carroll, Frederick), proposes a constitutional amendment requiring all Maryland counties to adopt a charter government structure.\nHouse Bill 278, also from Bouchat, would provide an income tax subtraction modification for enhanced agricultural management equipment to support sustainable farming practices.\nHouse Bill 192, introduced by Del. Nino Mangione (R-Baltimore County), aims to curb student cell phone use in schools under the proposed \"No Distracted Learning Act.\"\nAs these bills move through the legislature, local officials and residents will have the opportunity to voice their support or concerns during committee hearings and public forums. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After having battled another large snowfall just a month prior, road crews and first responders were prepared.\nCaroline, Talbot and Dorchester counties responded to the snow fast and were able to clear roads in a timely manner, allowing many government offices to open Wednesday.\n\"Our Public Works team was ready for the winter weather that hit Tuesday afternoon,\" Kathleen Freeman, Caroline County Administrator, said. \"Crews came in at 4 p.m., and with the rising temperatures, they quickly cleared the roads and made sure all county buildings were accessible.\"\n\"By 10 a.m. Wednesday, everything was set for a delayed start,\" she said. \"I want to thank our road crews and all essential staff for their hard work in making this event go as smoothly as possible. Their quick response kept everything running with minimal disruption for our community.\"\nCaroline County opened their offices at 10 a.m. Wednesday morning, as did Talbot County and the towns of Easton and Denton.\nTalbot County could not be reached for comment, but the county decided to open up their offices at 10 a.m. Wednesday morning.\nDorchester County's offices were open during regular business hours Wednesday, though non-essential employees were given the option to work from home if they could, according to a Facebook post from the county government.\n\"We had a great night. Snow slacked up earlier than expected. It was great experience,\" Dorchester County Manager Jerry Jones said. \"Folks stayed off the road. It was good Mother Nature is helping us. The window was bigger (than with the last snow) to get everything. Emergency responders were great as well.\"\nSchools decided to keep campuses closed Wednesday because of the snowfall, but several districts had students attend class virtually.\nTalbot County Public Schools conducted its first virtual learning day since 2020, and district officials were pleased with the results, according to TCPS Director of Communications Debbie Gardner.\n\"The feedback from school principals has been positive,\" Gardner said Wednesday afternoon. \"Student attendance has been better than we anticipated, and our teachers have done a fantastic job.\"\nDorchester County Public Schools conducted a virtual learning day as well, but could not be reached for comment.\nCaroline County Public Schools did not have students attend class virtually, but the district plans to open on time Thursday. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat.

We just don't know how this is going to unfold.\"\nCounty staff has been going through the operating and capital budgets line by line to find efficiencies, Jones said.\n\"We are constantly working on solutions,\" he said. \"We're finding those efficiencies. We have made substantial changes already.\"\nDuring the work session, Jones detailed estimated revenue and expenditures for fiscal year 2026. According to Jones' presentation, preliminary projections for the budget show a deficit of $6.2 million, with $87.7 million in estimated revenue and $93.9 million in estimated expenditures.\nJones outlined a list of mandates from the state that contribute to the county's deficit. These include reductions in grant funding, losses from proposed property tax deductions, an increase in state education maintenance of effort costs and increased financial responsibilities for things like teacher retirement.\nBoth Jones and County Council members said the budget would look a lot different without these mandates. Jones said that without the mandates, the county would not be facing a deficit. He said the county would instead have had $200,812 more in revenue than expenditures.\nThe council and county manager also talked about significant budget cuts made two years ago. Council Vice President Mike Detmer said the fat had already been trimmed from the budget at that time.\n\"At this point, we're trying to keep the ship from sinking,\" he said.\nCouncil President Lenny Pfeffer said he and Detmer have plans to go to Annapolis to testify in front of the Maryland General Assembly on legislation that would negatively affect the county's budget.\nEDUCATION FUNDING\nDetmer said the decrease in state funding and increase in the county's fiscal responsibility is largely driven by the state's goal to meet its financial obligation to the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a state plan that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education.\nDorchester County Public Schools, which has its own budget separate from the county, also is facing a deficit. The deficit, which was estimated to be $10.19 million in January, is now estimated to be $5.59 million.\nDuring a Dorchester County Board of Education budget work session also held Thursday, Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson shared refinements the district has made to the budget since the board's work session in January.\nHe said the $4.6 million in additional cuts to reduce the deficit were made through reductions to alternative education programming, supplies costs, travel costs, contracted services and fixed charges as well as expanding the district's understanding of Blueprint guidance to better match funding with expenses.\n\"We are taking it serious, and we are trying to make the changes we can to reduce our budget in a smart way,\" Thompson said.\nAt the County Council work session, council member Ricky Travers said other counties are having the same budget problems.\n\"Rural Maryland is the worst right now because the bigger counties, you just add another zero to it, but they've got a little bit more ability to garnish more money per penny (on taxes),\" he said. \"But this big number is astronomical.\"\nJones said the county will play it by ear on when it holds its next budget work session. He said when it is held will be announced to the public. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Talbot County OKs funding for Easton High School's auditorium lights was approved by the Talbot County Council at its Tuesday meeting.The auditorium's current lights date back to the school's renovation in 1997. County officials say they've heard for years about the need for new lights.\nThe project will cost $817,000, just over half of a total $1.5 million to be pulled from the county's capital projects fund. Talbot County's fiscal year 2025 budget has already accounted for the costs.\n\"That's huge for the auditorium,\" County Council President Chuck Callahan said. \"So I'm glad that went through. That's going to be big for the school.\"\nCouncil members also unanimously approved $556,000 for light replacements at St. Michaels Middle High School and $116,000 for athletic field improvements across the district.\nFollowing those approvals, the County Council passed a bill permitting the county's sale of bonds to borrow $26.9 million for Chapel District Elementary School renovations. That funding from the county spans both fiscal years 2025 and 2026.\nThe renovation project, which broke ground last August, will upgrade the existing building and add on an additional 16,000 square feet. Chapel Elementary was last renovated in 1994.\nCallahan said Talbot County Public Schools Director of Operations Kevin Shafer has done a \"phenomenal job\" leading renovation efforts.\n\"You've done excellent keeping us up to speed and everything, and trying to keep everything on budget,\" Callahan said. \"We really, really appreciate it. It's huge for the community down there too.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Talbot County provides first look at draft budget for FY26\n\n March 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 474\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Talbot County Manager Clay Stamp said one aspect was clear when drafting the county's fiscal year 2026 budget: it needed to remain flat.Speaking with the Talbot County Council at a workshop Tuesday, county employees presented a balanced draft budget coming in at $163.3 million. It comes in slightly below last year's budget of $163.8 million.\nThe county's total budget has ballooned in recent years. In fiscal year 2023, it was $112 million, and one year later, it rose to $128 million. It took a sharper jump to the $163 million mark last year.\nStamp said the increases were for good cause. \"You've made incredible and important investments in public safety and education,\" he told council members.\nBut Stamp emphasized that given federal uncertainties, state cost shifts and recurring county costs, it is important to curb that recent upward trend.\n\"That was a mandate as we put this budget together,\" Stamp said of the belt-tightening.\nStamp said the draft fiscal year 2026 budget currently proposes no additional job positions. The county's capital improvement plan is also trimmed back, he said. He hopes the county can focus on finishing projects already underway, such as Chapel District Elementary School renovations and a new EMS station in Cordova.\nWhen drafting the budget, Stamp and Finance Director Martha Sparks said they initially came in $6 million over their target. To remedy that, they're proposing delayed payments for postemployment benefits and correctional officers' retirements, respectively \u2014 the latter of which is to be expected to be included in fiscal year 2027.\nSparks mentioned that tax hikes proposed at the state level for wealthy individuals may have an impact on Talbot County revenues. Sparks said last time a similar tax increase was levied in 2009, it made a significant dent, partly due to the recession.\n\"We had an exodus of the wealthy in our county as a result of that,\" Sparks said. \"And it took us approximately 10 years to recover.\"\nSparks added, however, that the county looks OK for fiscal year 2026 in terms of those tax proposals. She said she's \"not sure what that will look like for us moving forward.\"\nAs for policy and funding shifts at the federal level, Stamp said \"it's reasonable\" to expect impacts will trickle down to Talbot County.\n\"We are cognizant of that,\" Stamp said. \"Radars are up, antennas are up. We're watching closely.\"\nThe draft budget shows $55 million in funding for the Talbot Board of Education. Stamp said the county must contribute that mark since it's required by state funding formulas. Any additional education funding is left for the County Council to consider in the coming weeks.\nCouncil members and staff will hold a number of workshops this month and in April before a budget proposal is officially introduced April 15.\nPublic budget hearings are scheduled for May 6, and the County Council is expected to enact a budget ordinance May 27. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The school's budget is $1.31 million higher than its fiscal year 2025 budget.\nPart of the $9.02 million budget request included a $952,560 request for the design of a new technical building. Chesapeake College Vice President for Administrative Services Karen Smith said the new building will have areas for a variety of programs, including agriculture, electrical, welding and fabrication, construction trades and advanced manufacturing. She said the cost for the design phase could be lower depending on state approval.\nAlthough the five counties approved the request for funding for the design, the decision came with a shift in contributions toward the project.\nDorchester County's share of costs for the design phase will be taken on by Queen Anne's County. This means Queen Anne's County's responsibility for the project will jump from 28.9%, or an estimated $275,290, to 47.8%, or an estimated $455,324.\nDuring the meeting, Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer and Vice President Mike Detmer outlined their council's concerns regarding paying for the project.\nAlthough other counties hope to use the new technical building for career and technical education at the high school level, Dorchester County has a career and technology center it is still paying off, they said.\nThrough its budget process, Dorchester County has struggled to eliminate an estimated $6.2 million deficit.\nPfeffer said Dorchester County takes in about $45 million in property and income taxes and will have to give Dorchester County Public Schools $26.6 million for fiscal year 2026.\n\"So we're trying to run the rest of the county on half of that,\" he said. \"So while in conceptual context, we believe in the project, fiscally our citizens and our staff are saying we don't know how we're going to be able to participate.\"\nAt the Chesapeake College meeting, Queen Anne's County Commissioner Jack Wilson Jr. shared his county's decision to cover Dorchester County for the project design costs.\n\"We all know what happens if we let this money go back to the state,\" Wilson said. \"It's going to go somewhere else in this state, and it's not going to be here. We got this far. And Lenny, listen, I feel for you guys. I know what you're going through. But I think we just need to keep it on the rails at least through the design phase and see what the state's going to help with.\"\nAccording to documents from the meeting, the state will support 75% of project costs, and the counties will support the remaining 25%.\nAfter the counties voted to approve the amended capital budget, Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian said he understands the position Dorchester County is in, mentioning the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and \"unfunded mandates\" by the state.\n\"I think we all understand any one of us could be in your same position very easily,\" Fithian told the Dorchester County Council members. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Don Abbatiello brings an impressive record of decades of public service to the race for president of the Easton Town Council.His 27 years teaching our young men and women is noteworthy by itself, but in addition, he has worked 16 years as part of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, both in the field and in administrative decisions. That kind of experience explains why he approaches even the toughest issues with an open mind and works hard to find agreement on the best solution for Easton.\nIn my dealings with him, he has been straightforward and a good listener \u2014 qualities that are too rare today. No ideologue, he focuses on the facts and not all the excitement around him. He does his homework and explains his reasoning.\nEaston faces some tough challenges over the next few years, including adopting a revised Comprehensive Plan, mitigating the shortage of affordable housing and keeping Easton a vibrant community. Having the right person as council president lead the debates that will resolve those difficult problems is essential.

Seventy kids aged 3 to 10 participated in the egg hunt, which Caroline County has been hosting the past 10 years.\n\"We love this. This is what we do it for,\" Davis said about having kids out for the event.\nWhile traditional Easter egg hunts take place in the daylight, the Caroline County event has an added obstacle for egg hunters \u2014 darkness. The annual hunt takes place at dusk, and children use flashlights to help locate eggs on the elementary school's lawn.\nEach age group had a special egg to look for. For ages 3 and 4, it was a soccer egg. For ages 5 to 7, it was a camouflage egg, and for ages 8 to 10, it was a football egg.\nEach group had a separate time slot to capture the most eggs they could and go after the special egg. When a child found the special egg, they received a special prize, an Easter basket.\nThe event is fun for the children, but Parks and Recreation employees have fun as well.\n\"I found different patches of taller grass, leaves, branches and twigs,\" Parks and Recreations employee Liam Wallace said about hiding the eggs. \"I kind of just hid it within those.\"\n\"It was just crazy. I wanted to see how happy they were out here, no elbows, no shoving, so safe fun,\" Halie Readores, another employee, said.\nLynn Zepp, a mother of two, brought her son, Weston, and daughter, Willow, to the egg hunt for their first year of participation.\n\"It was exciting,\" Lynn Zepp said. \"We just got done with a baseball game, and we rushed over here because we wanted to try out the flashlight egg hunt.\"\nWhen Weston and Willow were asked if they enjoyed the event, they said they had fun. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County makes its way through grueling budget process\n\n April 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Over the past four months, an atmosphere of concern, frustration and, at times, despair has colored budget meetings in Dorchester County.In mid-April, the Dorchester County Council introduced a $91.96 million proposed operating budget for fiscal year 2026 with proposals to increase taxes. The introduction came after months of work by county staff to eliminate an estimated $6.2 million deficit.\nAt the same time, Dorchester County Public Schools has been working to eliminate a multi-million dollar deficit of its own. At an April budget work session, DCPS Superintendent Jymil Thompson said the district is still $5.59 million in the hole. The district hopes to eliminate the deficit by the Board of Education's May meeting.\nTo balance and pass these budgets, difficult decisions \u2014 like the school district canceling summer school for 2025 and the county increasing 911 fees from $1.50 to $4.25 \u2014 have already been made.\n\"We hate to have to put any of this on the backs of our citizens, but these are state laws that are being passed down as a bandaid for us to pay,\" County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said in an interview with The Star Democrat. \"And unfortunately we're having to pass it down onto our citizens because we have no other revenue to pay these bills.\"\nWHAT MAKES FY26 DIFFERENT\nDorchester County's proposed operating budget is $10 million more than the fiscal year 2025 budget passed last May. County Manager Jerry Jones said the increases are in part due to new education requirements from the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education plan.\nJones said another reason the county has had to increase spending include cost shifts from the state to the county for things like teacher pensions.\nIn an effort to lessen budget costs, the county sought a waiver for the maintenance of effort for education, which is a law that requires counties to provide as much funding per pupil as was provided in the previous fiscal year. But with a narrow window between the state passing a budget and the waiver's due date, the county had to ask for an extension, which was denied.\n\"It's disappointing,\" Jones said. \"But at the end of the day, we've got to keep moving forward.\"\nThompson said Blueprint requirements, like increasing teacher starting salaries, are part of the reason why the school district's budget \u2014 which is separate from the county's \u2014 has been difficult to balance this year. He said inflation and recurring program costs have also hindered the process.\n\"No decision is easy,\" he said. \"But I think we're all trying to make the best decision for our students.\"\nBoth Jones and Thompson said they don't see the annual budget process getting easier any time soon. Jones said he doesn't see things getting easier unless change is made at the state level.\n\"I don't see (the budget) easing up in years to come unless some big changes are considered at the general assembly and future sessions,\" he said. \"We'll see how it plays out.\"\nTAX DIFFERENTIALS\nOne of the proposed changes to balance the county's budget is to remove the tax differential, or lower property tax rate, for Cambridge and Hurlock. This would mean Cambridge and Hurlock residents would have to pay the full property tax rate.\nCambridge Mayor Lajan Cephas said although the county is trying its best to balance the budget, she believes this measure is unfair to Cambridge residents. She said the tax differential essentially returns money to tax payers for \"duplicated\" services.\nCephas also said Cambridge is growing, which will increase the tax base and bring in more revenue for the county. She said the county should instead look into raising taxes in unincorporated areas that are \"a little bit better off.\"\nJones said he doesn't know what the final budget will look like, but said the council welcomes input.\n\"We want people to come forward and contribute to this conversation,\" he said.\nAdoption of Dorchester County's budget is slated for May 20. The county's first public budget hearing will be held May 6.\nThompson said the Dorchester County Board of Education has to pass the budget by the end of June, but he hopes the board will pass the budget in May to give staff time to make necessary preparations. \n\n Copyright  2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County OKs $161 million budget\n\n May 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 685\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Talbot County made good on its promise to deliver a flat, conservative budget for fiscal year 2026. The County Council unanimously passed a $161.1 million spending plan Tuesday.It comes in at nearly $3 million under last year's budget amid what County Manager Clay Stamp calls \"uncharted waters.\"\n\"The economic landscape out there is a bumpy ride right now,\" Stamp said. \"This year, we knew that we needed to flatten the budget out, we needed to live within our means.\"\nStamp and other officials have emphasized Talbot County's continued financial commitments toward public safety, whether through capital projects such as an EMS station in Cordova or support for correctional officers.\nIn a draft version of the budget that only received a few adjustments Tuesday, the council is expected to allocate the following funds for public safety:\n$11.5 million for emergency medical services.$10.5 million for the Talbot County Sheriff's Office.$7.6 million for the Department of Corrections.$5.4 million for emergency management.$3.3 million for volunteer fire departments.\nCouncil members thanked Stamp, Finance Director Martha Sparks and Assistant Finance Director Kaitlin Foster-Clark for their work during the budget process.\n\"This was the most challenging budget that I've ever sat through,\" council member Keasha Haythe said. \"The decisions were very hard on some items.\"\n\"It was definitely a heavy lift this year, but everyone bucked down, and we made it happen here,\" council member Dave Stepp said.\nThe county's property tax rate will remain largely steady at 79 cents per $100 of assessed value, though residents will see a supplemental tax of just over 1 cent per $100 of value on their tax bills.\nEDUCATION FUNDING\nThat supplement stems from education funding OK'd by the county. While most line items were ironed out through deliberations, workshops and meetings, Tuesday's discussion centered on funding amendments for Talbot County Public Schools.\nThe budget already included $55 million in education funding as required by The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's initiative to fund and improve education. County Council members were left to consider how much the county would contribute above that mark.\nIn a 4-1 vote Tuesday, the council approved an additional $600,000 in funding for schools, aimed at filling nine positions, including multilingual and special education roles. Council member Lynn Mielke was the sole no vote.\nThe approved budget change came after an amendment to fulfill the district's entire $1.1 million request \u2014 which had been scaled back from $5.5 million earlier this budget cycle \u2014 failed narrowly. Vice President Pete Lesher and Haythe favored the $1.1 million, but President Chuck Callahan, Stepp and Mielke did not.\nLesher argued it is \"short-sighted\" to not fund the full request. He said it'd be prudent for the county to gradually increase its education funding as even higher Blueprint projections loom in future fiscal years.\n\"This would be a small step in that direction,\" Lesher said. \"And frankly, it will make next year, an election year, a lot easier for all of us up here.\"\n\"I think we should be going farther,\" he said of the $600,000 mark. \"But this goes some distance.\"\nCallahan sponsored the amendment to partially OK the district's request, citing the significant need for teachers. The $500,000 not approved by the council was requested by the district to increase teacher and instructional assistant salaries.\n\"I would ask that the school board use the money that we give you for (hiring) teachers,\" Callahan said. \"I would like to see that, and not for something else.\"\nMielke said she was initially on board with Callahan's amendment. But she said she needs \"more security\" that the district will put the $600,000 toward the nine positions.\n\"I'm not advised that it necessarily would be,\" Mielke said. \"So for that reason I couldn't support it.\"\nA spokesperson for Talbot County Public Schools said in a statement to The Star Democrat that the district stands behind the $1.1 million request but understands the \"challenges faced by council and staff in meeting the funding needs of Talbot County in these uncertain times.\"\n\"We are grateful for their support for educators' pensions and for the additional staff needed to serve our students,\" the statement read.\nThis story has been updated to include a statement from Talbot County Public Schools. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dorchester County's recommendations for 2026 do not differ too much.\nThe Dorchester County Council's five recommendations are:\nTo consider a pause or suspension of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future education plan to allow counties to catch up financially.To rethink or review existing rules or policies that override local control over solar energy regulations.To improve infrastructure related to transportation and water drainage in Dorchester County.To introduce an initiative regarding safety concerns of solar battery storage and concerns regarding the sufficiency of the decommissioning bond that covers the cost of removing solar infrastructure once it's no longer in use.To continue to reform juvenile justice. This recommendation came after a 15-year-old resident shot and killed another resident in the 900 block of Cornelia Street on June 8.\nCounty Council Vice President Mike Detmer said juvenile justice laws need serious reformation to make Dorchester County a safer place.\n\"Whether you're below 18 or over 18, you have to get some feedback for your actions,\" Detmer said. \"Your terrible actions aren't in a vacuum; we all live here.\"\nThe purpose of MACo's recommended initiatives is to address problems counties are facing with state legislators. County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said the organization collects concerns and information from counties to assist them in navigating the legislative process at the General Assembly.\nDetmer said that these initiatives don't always align with Dorchester County due to the county's unique set of problems, and this misalignment has caused some tension with the state. \"You know, things are complicated,\" he said. \"I would say the tension really stems from the policies and laws that the state is enacting.\"\nElected officials from Maryland's 23 counties and Baltimore City can submit legislative proposal initiatives on behalf of the county as an elected body, generally at an open meeting or via a voting process, or not on behalf of the county, but as an individual.\nNominations can be submitted online through June 27 on the MACo website. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline commissioners weigh potential locations for new Lockerman Middle\n\n June 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 666\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 During the Caroline County Commissioners' open comment report Tuesday morning, Commissioners Vice President Larry Porter brought up the discussion on Lockerman Middle School's proposed locations.Porter said he preferred that the new middle school go on the North Caroline High School property, one of two locations being considered during the design processes for the building begin. The other location, near the county sheriff's office on Double Hills Road, presents several challenges, Porter said.\n\"I think at this point I would like to say that I am in favor of the North Carolina location as opposed to being built in town,\" Porter said.\nCommissioners Frank Bartz agreed with Porter and cited traffic and safety concerns on Route 404.\nThe commissioners also had discussions about the school's location at their meeting two weeks ago.\nAt that meeting, County Administrator Kathleen Freeman presented the two location options. Commissioners President Travis Breeding sparked a conversation about how much sway the commissioners have over the school's location.\n\"How much influence do the commissioners actually have over where the school gets constructed?\" Breeding asked two weeks ago. \"As part of the funding of this, other than a survey, we haven't really been consulted.\"\nBreeding then explained the issues they would run into with each potential location.\n\"From what I gather, it seemed like a lot of people really preferred the Double Hills location. But, with Double Hills, we've got to work out a ton of details with the Town of Denton as far as sewer, water allocation for that to work, potentially pump station upgrades,\" Breeding said.\nHe then mentioned traffic issues on Route 404 with beach traffic towards the end of the school year and students from northern county towns like Marydale, who would have to take the bus a long distance to the potential Double Hills location.\nPorter, said he didn't recall that \"the county did not have a lot of input\" on the design of new county buildings in the past.\nFreeman assured Breeding that the county will be involved with the full feasibility study for both sites to determine which site makes the most sense.\nBreeding also brought forward discussion of how much influence the commissioners will have for the design of the school.\n\"Then also, how much input do we have over the the design?\" Breeding asked. \"I mean, we don't want a situation where we're building something that's way more expensive than it needs to be or making it as functional as we can and keeping the cost as low as we can.\"\nBartz raised an issue where if the county has to build a new detention center, a school on the Double Hills Road site would cause a problem. The Caroline County Sheriff's Office is located near that Double Hills Road site, making the location logical for a detention center, he said.\nThe county is in talks with Queen Anne's County about a new 388-bed regional detention center that would house all Caroline, Queen Anne's and Kent county prisoners. After conversations about control and cost of the center, discussions between the three counties have slowed down.\nLockerman name\nPorter pointed out conversation that are being had about the Lockerman's name staying at the location of the current building instead of being attached to the new school.\nThough the existing building will no longer be used as a school when the new school is built, Porter said he was in favor of keeping the Lockerman name attached to the facility in the interest of honoring its history.\n\"I think it's going to be important that the history of the school and the name of Lockerman be retained,\" he said. \"I don't know what the future use is going to be for that building, but it's important, I think, from the alumni standpoint, from the community standpoint, that the history be be kept there for whatever use is going to be done in the future.\"\nBreeding suggested drafting a letter of intent to the Caroline County Board of Education stating that it would be the commissioners' intention to retain the name of the building. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hignutt and Simmons explained multiple numbers within their budget including increasing administrators salaries to become competitive with neighboring counties. The commissioners also discussed Lockerman Middle School and the potential new location. Simmons said the Board of Education will keep a close working relationship with the commissioners throughout the process.Lori Bishop and Charlotte Brown provided an update on the addition to 4-H Park. The addition is almost complete, but the bathrooms failed inspection due to sinks being too tall and toilets being to far from the wall.Daniel Fox discussed Opioid Settlement Fund with the county commissioners. The county received $358,000 in local direct payments and $515,000 in target aid grants for opioid settlement. The county plans to talk with other departments and agencies to see how the fund will properly assist on a one-time basis.The county conducted the second reading and public hearing for an emergency bill on wastewater treatment facilities. The bill will allow for non-accessory wastewater treatment facilities to be permitted by special use exception, provided the facilities hold MDE discharge permits for five years and the proposed application is similar to the previous application. The Planning Commission had a positive recommendation. The commissioners moved the discussion to a third reading at their next meeting.During the county administration report, Kathleen Freeman told the commissioners about a conversation she had with Robbie Gill about a new YMCA in Caroline County. The commissioners are adamant about getting a new YMCA in Caroline County and believe the conversations need to turn into building.",

After the discussion the commissioners talked about Lockerman Middle School and the next steps.\n\"I think it'd be good for us to say that we are working together on the Lockerman Middle School construction,\" Commissioners President Travis Breeding said. \"We were asking questions about what role the commissioners officially play in siting and construction, they were just questions that we were asking. It wasn't like the Board of Ed's going to run all over us and make crazy stupid decisions and we're going to be stuck with it. It was just what influence do we have over the process.\"\nBreeding explained the consensus the commissioners have come to on their personal choice for the new school location.\n\"I think we talked about it, and our consensus is that the most logical place to put it is probably next to North Carolina High School for us,\" Breeding said. \"We understand that there's a whole process that has to be going through, fact finding, the Board of Ed will review that and make their decisions based off of that. But we were just saying that that questioning what influence we actually had over the process.\"\nSimmons clarified they understand the commissioners wanting understanding of their role and told the commissioners how the process will go.\n\"Board of Education selects the site,\" Simmons said. \"The feasibility study, which was presented to the board on July 1st, indicated North Caroline High School was the better of the two locations. We did review the two sites that we were asked to review that were basically the county-owned, which is cost efficient way to do it.\nSimmons said the board received the feasibility study that night and should be making its decision on a site at the August meeting. He added the site selection does not include picking what the design of the building will be.\nAfter looking over potential designs for the new Lockerman Middle School, Breeding suggested having athletic facilities have their own location and not sharing fields.\n\"One of the major things that stuck out with me was, relocating the athletic facilities around there,\" Breeding said. \"If we can get dedicated facilities so we're not sharing space like we have been doing forever, where lacrosse or soccer is using the outfield of the softball and the baseball field, if we can actually get dedicated space, that would be a priority of mine.\"\nHe noted that facilities in surrounding counties should be studied.\n\"We've got one bite at the apple here, let's get it right,\" Breeding said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From crushes to banning cell phones \u2014 Maryland lawmakers propose new legislation covering range of issues\n\nFebruary 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\nAuthor/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@chespub.com | Section: News\n\n636 Words\n\nRead News Document\n\nANNAPOLIS \u2013 Maryland state senators and delegates have introduced a variety of bills in the 2024 legislative session, addressing issues ranging from state symbols and education mandates to law enforcement policy and budget concerns.State Symbols and Utility Regulations\nState Sen. Steve Hershey (R-36) has introduced Senate Bill 562, which would designate the original Maryland Orange Crush as the state cocktail. The bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Johnny Mautz (R-37) and Mary Beth Carozza (R-38).\nHershey also sponsored Senate Bill 561, which, along with House Bill 227 sponsored by Del. Chris Adams (R-37B), would allow electric cooperatives to use unclaimed funds only to assist cooperative members or donate to nonprofit organizations, rather than treating them as abandoned property.\nAdditionally, Hershey introduced Senate Bill 355, seeking to delay the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program by two years.\nEnergy and Education Legislation\nDel. Jeff Ghrist (R-36) is behind two bills on solar energy regulation: House Bill 739 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 478) and House Bill 742. One bill would prohibit the use of eminent domain for solar siting, while the other would return control over solar development to county governments.\nGhrist also introduced House Bill 736, which seeks to remove the mandate requiring local school systems to offer pre-kindergarten for three-year-olds. Another provision in the bill would increase state funding to help Kent County construct a new middle school.\nOn law enforcement, Ghrist is supporting a bill \u2014 potentially House Bill 122 \u2014 that would require the removal of unfounded complaints from police personnel files.\nNursing, Historic Preservation, and Cemetery Protections\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-37B) has proposed House Bill 602 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 407), directing the State Board of Nursing to negotiate reciprocity agreements with neighboring states for advanced practice nursing licensure. Another measure, House Bill 616 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 421), would extend the statute of limitations for crimes related to cemetery destruction and prohibit damaging cemetery landscaping. The bill is co-sponsored by Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-37A).\nHutchinson is also behind House Bill 760, which would establish a local appeals process for Maryland Historic Trust decisions.\nBudget Deficit Shifts to Counties\nGov. Wes Moore's proposed budget shifts some of the state's structural deficit onto county governments. Del. Jeff Ghrist (R-36) criticized the move, stating that counties did not contribute to the deficit but are now being forced to compensate for state overspending.\n\"For my district, $720,000 will be shifted to Caroline County on top of an additional $1.8 million more that the county will have to add to education under Kirwan mandates,\" Ghrist stated. He cited similar financial burdens for other Eastern Shore counties, including Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne's.\n\"This will stifle economic growth because people will be sending more of their hard-earned money to the government rather than spending it in their local economies,\" Ghrist added.\nLaw Enforcement and Traffic Stop Restrictions\nA controversial proposal, Senate Bill 292, has drawn strong opposition from law enforcement officials, including Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker. The bill would reclassify certain primary traffic offenses as secondary offenses, preventing law enforcement from stopping drivers solely for those violations.\n\"These minor traffic violations could actually lead to catching suspects that have committed serious felonies, recovering firearms, and stopping drug-related crimes,\" Baker said. A hearing on the bill is scheduled before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee.\nOther Bills of Local Interest\nHouse Bill 28, sponsored by Del. Josh Bouchat (R-5), proposes a constitutional amendment requiring all Maryland counties to adopt a charter government structure.\nHouse Bill 278, also from Bouchat, would provide an income tax subtraction modification for enhanced agricultural management equipment to support sustainable farming practices.\nHouse Bill 192, introduced by Del. Nino Mangione (R-42A), aims to curb student cell phone use in schools under the proposed \"No Distracted Learning Act.\"\nAs these bills move through the legislature, local officials and residents will have the opportunity to voice their support or concerns during committee hearings and public forums.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Character Counts coaches teach trustworthiness, respect and fairness to school-age kids.\nCurrent Caroline County commissioners and other officials attended and spoke to the expansive impacts both Layton and Mueller had on the local community.\nStacy Seward, one many local softball players coached by Layton, recalled fond memories of her former mentor.\n\"He created lasting memories for so many young athletes,\" said Seward, the county's grants coordinator. \"For example, teaching us how to slide in the playground sand at Denton Elementary School, saying 'If I can get my old body down here, you girls can too.'\"\nSteward said he was key to creating the county's first ever softball travel team.\n\"He was the true backbone to girls' softball, not only in Caroline County, but to the entire Eastern Shore,\" Seward said.\nCommission Vice President Larry Porter said Layton, a commissioner of eight years and former investigator for the State's Attorney's Office, always put Caroline County first.\nDaughter Jaclyn Crawford said her father's \"real gift was his deep commitment to young people.\"\n\"In each role, he was known for his competitive spirit, but above all, his determination to make life safer and better for the community,\" Crawford said.\nIn addition to Crawford, other family members of Roger Layton who attended Saturday's dedication included: wife Faye Layton, sister Rena Callahan, stepfather Ronald Sard, granddaughter Madison Weston, cousin Rick Davis and more.\nAfter Layton's sign was unveiled, the curtain was removed off of a large plaque dedicated to Mueller. Husband John Mueller then reflected on his wife's knack for helping people.\n\"If she heard that you needed something, she'd be the one to offer,\" her husband said. \" ... She was always there first.\"\nHe recalled not just her volunteer efforts as a character coach for elementary school kids, but also her assistance in collecting dog and cat food for the local Humane Society.\nIn addition to John Mueller, his four kids and six grandchildren attended Saturday's dedication, as well as Sarah's mom, Jessie Browne.\nAround four years ago, the Mueller family donated $20,000 to the county for upkeep and improvements at Harmony Community Park, including to the pavilion, walking trails and playground.\nCounty commissioners thanked the Mueller family for their donation to the park and spoke about Sarah Mueller's lasting legacy.\n\"Sarah was more than a neighbor,\" Porter said. \"She was a friend, volunteer, mother and a mentor who gave so much of herself to this community, from her time as a Character Counts coach to her years with the Girl Scouts, where she poured her love into children and back.\n\"By placing her name here at Harmony Park, we make sure her kindness, spirit and her legacy will always be a part of this place.\" \n\n Copyright  2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "MACo leaders meet with Talbot officials to discuss 2026 General Assembly\n\n September 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 536\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Leaders from the Maryland Association of Counties shared predictions for a calmer legislative session in 2026 during a meeting with the Talbot County Council on Tuesday.Michael Sanderson, MACo's executive director, and Jack Wilson, the association's president and current Queen Anne's County commissioner, met for an annual check-in with Talbot officials.\nSanderson reminded the council members of last year's volatile General Assembly session, during which legislators and Gov. Wes Moore (D) had to reckon with closing a $3 billion gap in the state's fiscal year 2026 budget.\nSome savings came through cost shifts placing more burden on county governments, the MACo leaders said. But they added that the upcoming 2026 session, and the fiscal year 2027 budget that goes along with it, likely won't be as dire.\n\"Relatively calm, probably not a big crisis,\" Sanderson said of his projection for this year's session, which officially kicks off Jan. 14 in Annapolis.\nHe said the large budgetary concerns are likely to reappear in 2027 as legislators put together a plan for fiscal year 2028.\n\"The story from last year is gonna repeat itself, but with a year off,\" Sanderson predicted.\nSpecifically, the executive director said Maryland's expansive education funding formula, The Blueprint, will influence the 2027 session. And in the short-term, some counties are already coming to grips with increasing cost shares for education.\n\"Every county is either in the midst or a year or two away from seeing a year where the increase in school spending required under Blueprint requires all the money or even more money than your county's likely to gain in revenue for that year,\" Sanderson said. \"It's an obvious squeeze at the local level.\"\nTalbot County's fiscal year 2026 budget included $55 million in education funding required by The Blueprint's formulas. On top of that, the council approved an additional $600,000 in funding to fill new positions.\nThat mark had been scaled back twice from the original ask the Talbot Board of Education made of the council \u2014 first requesting $5.5 million in supplementary funds, then $1.1 million.\nCounty Council Vice President Pete Lesher, who supported the district's $1.1 million request earlier this year, said it was \"short-sighted\" for the county to only fund the district's request partially, given that Blueprint requirements are only set to increase in future years. But other council members opted to hold back on dedicating the full request as the county aimed to even out its spending hikes seen in years prior.\nSanderson said on Tuesday that housing legislation will be at the forefront this winter. Recently, Moore signed an executive order that aims to speed up the permitting and building of affordable housing projects.\n\"I anticipate that being a big fight,\" Sanderson said. \"Whether it's a big fight in the more rural jurisdictions is yet to be seen.\"\nCouncil Member Lynn Mielke asked how Easton fits into state plans to tackle the housing issue.\nSanderson said there's an opportunity for MACo to advocate for provisions so a potential housing package doesn't \"overwhelm\" local jurisdictions. He said the association can help push for certain changes to help counties and towns that lack authority in certain areas, such as the variation of impact fees on developers.\n\"At the same time, we generally want to keep land use decisions local,\" he added. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore fights for the Shore\n\n October 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 336\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I've been a Republican all my life \u2014 as the mayor of my town, as a delegate who defeated a Democratic incumbent to serve in Annapolis, and when I voted for Donald Trump in the last presidential election.There's no doubt I'm a Republican, but I'll proudly cross that party line to back Gov. Wes Moore and his mission to build a Maryland that leaves no one behind.\nI was born in Salisbury, raised near Crisfield and served the people of Delmar for two decades \u2014 I know what it's like to live in a community that feels forgotten by Annapolis. I've worked with a lot of local leaders and several governors, trust me when I tell you, Wes Moore is different.\nIn two and half years, he's made 51 visits to the Eastern Shore and just last week was the first governor to visit Smith Island since 1999. But he doesn't just come to the Shore; he brings investment with him.\nSince taking office he's put $1.9 billion in education funding here; he's made historic investments in rural health care and hospitals opening TidalHealth in Salisbury and breaking ground on the University of Maryland Shore Regional Medical Center; he's put a $10 million investment to improve our waterways up and down the Shore; and he's cut through the red tape to open and expand businesses in places like Caroline County and Dorchester County.\nBut perhaps most importantly, he's focused two of the state's strongest poverty fighting initiatives in our rural communities. His ENOUGH Act includes funding to Dorchester and Caroline counties to end generational childhood poverty, and Cambridge was named as one of the first Just Communities giving them priority access to funding that will help increase assets, home ownership and home values.\nWe are seeing momentum across the state and in our own communities that we just can't afford to lose. I've endorsed him, I believe in him, and I'm proud to work alongside him, because I know Gov. Moore fights for the Shore.\nCARL L.

Here's the problem with that: Hairdryers, curling wands and flat irons are required to produce heat, which means they pull large amounts of amperage to get them good and hot. Plugging them into a power strip is just asking for trouble. These types of hairdressing appliances must be plugged directly into a wall outlet - preferably one with a ground-fault circuit interrupter breaker to avoid danger should those tools accidentally be exposed to water.REFRIGERATOR AND FREEZER.These appliances pull too much current for a power strip because they are continuously cycling on and off.That will quickly overload a power strip. These items need to be plugged directly into a wall outlet dedicated solely to that appliance.TOASTER.Here's the clue: It has exposed wires inside those slots that heat up to become red-hot. It takes a lot of current to fire up those wires, which can easily overload a power strip. So, no, do not plug your toaster into an extension cord or power strip.Ditto for your toaster oven.MICROWAVE.I still think of my microwave oven as a miracle for food preparation, thawing, cooking and reheating in a fraction of the time it takes a conventional oven. However, such incredible activity demands more energy than what a power strip can deliver.SPACE HEATER.Most portable heaters consume 1,500 watts of energy on their high settings. Connect one to a power strip and it becomes potentially hazardous due to allowing them to run for an extended period. \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Fire group raising $5 million for training center\n\n August 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 667\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - The Friends of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department are in the midst of a capital campaign for the Emergency Services Training Campus in Easton, seeking to raise $5 million in a two-to three-year timeframe.Located at 9095 Mistletoe Dr., the state-of-the-art training campus will serve the town of Easton, fire departments, emergency service personnel, law enforcement and paramedics in Talbot County for specialized education and certification. Currently, volunteer firefighters on the Mid-Shore have two options for training facilities in Princess Anne in Somerset County or Centreville in Queen Anne's County.Components of the project include a 3,500-square-foot concrete public safety building for first responder training, a 3,600-squarefoot classroom training and storage building and a 1,500-square-foot concrete pad for car fire, extrication and stabilization, and traffic safety training.Training for fire departments will include firefighting skills, rescue, and motor-vehicle fire and extraction. Law enforcement training will include hostage rescue, physical training and testing, traffic training, Homeland Security and K-9 operations. Emergency Medical Services can use classroom facilities for their training.\"This state-of-the-art training campus will not only support EVFD members for their training but will also help us in recruiting and training new members for the department. The training campus will also enable us to support our partners in law enforcement and emergency services in their training and recruitment needs and to better coordinate our roles in emergencies.We encourage the community to support our fundraising efforts as we embark on this $5 million goal,\" said fire Capt. Daryl Caldwell.The town of Easton gifted the use of a 2.7 acre property on Mistletoe Drive to the volunteer fire department for a state-of-the-art training center. This facility will serve both the town of Easton and the six local volunteer fire departments in Talbot County, as well as fire departments across the Mid-Shore. Talbot County has 260 active firefighters that respond to thousands of calls. EVFD responded to 896 calls involving 10,000 man hours in 2022 and conducted 1910 hours of training in 2022.\"It has never been more important than now to train our first responders and emergency personnel who serve Talbot County every day. There currently is no dedicated first responder training campus in Talbot County. The Friends of the EVFD and its volunteers accepted the challenge to raise $5 million for facility construction and operational expenses for the new campus.This campaign is essential toward ensuring cutting-edge training is available for all emergency services personnel,\" said campaign co-chairman Brett Whitehead.\"The sheriff's office is very excited to see this project come to fruition. The facility will not only offer training to our dedicated volunteer firefighters but will be able to support training for our deputies and police officers. Our citizens deserve the best-trained law enforcement officers. This training facility will support localized training to better equip our deputies while saving hard-earned taxpayer funds through reduced travel time and associated expenses. The facility will also be available for K-9 training for tracking people as well as drug detection,\" Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said.\"We're very excited about the brand-new state-of-the-art training facility to be used by fire departments, EMTs, and law enforcement around the Mid-Shore. This facility will allow us to train and recruit talented first responders from around the region. The Town is fully committed to helping our first responders safely and effectively serve our community, and this training facility is a crucial resource that will improve many facets of their operations. We are very thankful for the dedication and selfless service of the men and women who volunteer to protect and serve our Town, and thankful that they go above and beyond to ensure our community's safety, Easton Mayor Megan Cook said.For further information or to donate to the Friends of the EVFD Public Safety Capital Campaign for its Emergency Services Training Campus in Easton, contact Brett Whitehead at (302) 236-6249 or by email at whitenj20@gmail.com. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF FRIENDS OF THE EASTON VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT\n \nAn artistic rendering shows the planned Emergency Services Training Campus in Easton. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2023-09-15",

    "content": "It's time to confront ongoing youth violence\n\n September 15, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Armstrong Williams | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 689\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n If you go to Google and type \"heinous crimes up with young people,\" you'll see over 2 billion results.It's a stark reminder that the alarming trend of young people committing gruesome acts isn't a new phenomenon, but the sheer proliferation and frequency of these acts most certainly is. Our society is grappling with a disconcerting reality - a reality born out of the convergence of various factors.From the messages embedded in our music to the desensitizing violence prevalent in our culture, and even the erosion of moral and ethical values, each contributes to the emergence of a more violent society.It's a society where individuals no longer temper their darkest impulses, and regrettably, it's our youth who often find themselves on the frontline, manifesting behaviors at an unacceptable rate. This is a phenomenon that should deeply trouble us all and lead us to pause in concern for the direction in which our society is headed.These young individuals, driven by a cocktail of influences, often react impulsively or, in the gravest of cases, meticulously plan calculated crimes that result in the loss of innocent lives. We've witnessed stories like that of Mackenzie Shirilla, a name etched into the annals of a society grappling with the aftermath of senseless violence.Shirilla was recently found guilty of the murder of her boyfriend, Dominic Russo, and her friend, Davion Flanagan. Their tragic deaths underscore the gravity of the situation we're facing - a situation where young people are becoming entangled in webs of aggression and desperation. In Shirilla's case, she purposely sped up her car to 100 mph and drove straight into a wall, instantly killing her boyfriend and friend.The breakdown of morality in our society is contributing to this disturbing trend. Traditional values that once served as guiding principles seem to be waning, leaving a moral vacuum in which right and wrong are increasingly ambiguous. The erosion of moral foundations means that young people are less equipped to distinguish between ethical choices and destructive actions.The deterioration of ethics further compounds the issue. Ethical conduct is the cornerstone of a civilized society, fostering a sense of responsibility and accountability. Yet, as we witness these disturbing trends among our youth, it becomes evident that the concept of ethics is losing its grip. The pursuit of personal gain, even at the expense of others, has become alarmingly normalized.As we reflect on these developments, the implications for our future are profoundly concerning. A society that permits the erosion of morality and ethics in its younger generation is sowing the seeds of its own demise. The actions of today's youth foreshadow the trajectory of tomorrow's adults. If we fail to address these concerning trends, we risk a future marked by increased violence, social fragmentation and a dearth of empathy.It's time for us to confront these unsettling truths and take meaningful action. By reemphasizing morality and ethics in our families, communities and institutions, we can recalibrate the moral compass of our youth. This requires an unwavering commitment to fostering values that prioritize human dignity, compassion and respect for one another. Only through concerted efforts to restore these foundational principles can we hope to guide our society toward a more harmonious and promising future.This alarming trend of young people exhibiting violence and aggression should serve as an urgent wake-up call for our educational institutions. We must prioritize emotional education alongside academic excellence. By equipping our youth with the tools to manage their emotions, resolve conflicts constructively and communicate effectively, we can help curb the escalation of anger and violence.It's imperative that our schools become places not only of intellectual growth but also of emotional well-being and character development.The rising wave of heinous acts committed by young people underscores the pressing need for a comprehensive societal response. We must address the erosion of morality and ethics, and we must prioritize emotional education within our education system. This is a challenge that requires the collective effort of families, communities, educators and cultural influencers. By refocusing on our shared values, investing in the emotional well-being of our youth and fostering a renewed sense of empathy, we can shape a society that rejects violence and paves the way for a brighter and more harmonious future.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

All of the county's schools will be operating on a two-hour delay schedule Wednesday, Jan. 10, for evaluation of overnight flooding and storm damage, according to the school system.\nQueen Anne's County Public Schools were also dismissed early Tuesday due to the storm. As of Tuesday afternoon, all of the county's schools are set to run on a 90-minute delayed opening Wednesday, with reevaluation and modifications possible in the morning.\nSchools in Talbot and Caroline counties canceled all after-school activities Tuesday. Both districts are monitoring conditions to determine if delays or closures will be necessary Wednesday.\nThe Caroline County Board of Education meeting will be held as scheduled at 6 p.m. Tuesday.\nGov. Wes Moore enacted a State of Preparedness declaration Tuesday morning, directing the state's department of emergency management to coordinate responses to the storm's impacts.\nRainfall of 1 to 3 inches is possible across the region Tuesday, with the heaviest rain expected Tuesday night before tapering off Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe main concern is the potential for coastal flooding in Talbot and Queen Anne's counties, said Mike Lee, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Philadelphia/Mount Holly office. Dorchester County is also expected to experience significant flooding.\nA coastal flood warning is in effect from 7 p.m. Tuesday to 7 p.m. Wednesday for areas along the lower Chesapeake Bay, including Cambridge, which will see major impact from flooding early Wednesday morning, according to the Weather Service. Water is expected be two to three feet above ground level in some low-lying areas.\nA coastal flood warning and a flood watch are in effect for Talbot, Caroline, Queen Anne's and Kent counties from Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday morning.\nModerate coastal flooding is possible Tuesday with the high tide cycle. Water levels are expected to continue rising Tuesday night from strong southerly winds. The rising water levels could lead to potentially significant flooding.\nThe highest tides will be early Wednesday morning and again in the afternoon.\nWidespread roadway flooding is expected across the region's bayside communities and along tidal waterways. Dorchester County could see road closures.\nStrong, gusty winds are also expected to build across the region throughout the day Tuesday.\nDorchester County is under a high wind warning from 4 p.m. Tuesday to 4 a.m. Wednesday, with south to southeast winds of 30 to 40 mph with gusts up to 60 mph possible. Fallen trees, downed power lines and widespread power outages are expected.\nTalbot, Caroline, Kent and Queen Anne's counties are under a wind advisory from 5 p.m. Tuesday to 3 a.m. Wednesday. Sustained winds of 25 to 35 mph are expected, with gusts up to 55 mph.\nThe already-saturated ground in the region has also made trees more vulnerable to becoming uprooted with strong winds.\nThe Talbot County Department of Emergency Services urged residents to make sure loose items are secured ahead of time and reminded residents to not drive through or stand in flooded roadways.\nThe region will dry out some on Thursday, but a second storm is likely to roll through the region again Friday night into Saturday, the Weather Service said.\nThis story has been updated to include information on school delays and closures.

Wes Moore said he expects \"robust debates\" about juvenile justice in coming weeks \u2014 and that his administration will be an \"active participant\" trying to balance rehabilitation with cracking down on crime.\"The hallmark of what I hope to see in any juvenile justice legislation that's going to make it to my desk can be summarized in one word: accountability,\" the governor said. \"I believe in rehabilitation, but I will not tolerate lawlessness.\"\nMoore's comments came Tuesday, a day before the opening of the 2024 Maryland General Assembly, in a press conference devoted to his legislative priorities regarding public safety. He said he plans to press for three measures aimed at promoting victim's compensation, expanding apprenticeships in law enforcement jobs and preventing firearm violence.\nBut he also mused aloud on the issue of juvenile justice, at a time when state Republican officials are calling for passage of tougher crime policies \u2014 and specifically for reversing recent reforms to the youth legal system. House Republican Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany, recently vowed to toughen up what he called Maryland's \"soft-on-crime policies.\"\nMoore said Tuesday he will demand accountability for young offenders who are repeatedly violating the law, or who use a handgun to threaten the safety of others.\nWhile Moore acknowledged the coming debate over juvenile crime this session, he stressed the importance of supporting communities and the advocates working at the grassroots level to prevent violence.\nHe said he supports lengthening probation for juveniles found guilty of certain crimes to allow for more time for rehabilitation programs. He also backs moving more crimes related to illegal guns from misdemeanors to felonies.\n\"It takes a village to raise a child, and it will take a village to build safer communities,\" Moore said.\nThe legislative criminal justice proposals Moore announced do not address the treatment of juveniles, but rather focus on other things.\nHe proposed establishing a firearm prevention center based on recommendations from the Safer States Initiative launched by Vice President Kamala Harris.\nThe statewide office would work in partnership with the White House, taking an \"all of government\" approach to effective prevention and intervention policies or programs, according to Rob Wilcox, deputy director of Biden's Office of Gun Violence Prevention. Maryland would be the first state to establish such a center, said Wilcox, who spoke at Moore's press conference.\n\"It's a critical step to focus investments and drive the strategies that we know will save lives,\" Wilcox said.\nAccording to Moore, 75% of homicides in Maryland are committed with a gun. He said he considers it not only a public safety issue but a public health issue. He pledged to get illegal guns \"off of our streets.\"\nTo help wage that fight, Moore hopes to recruit more people into law enforcement and public safety with a bill to promote apprenticeships.\n\"We need officers who reflect the diversity of our great state,\" Secretary of Labor Portia Wu said, \"and we need them to come from the neighborhoods they serve.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One in three of the top 100 free apps on the Google Play store have banner ads, including ads for adult content, the website says.\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, in 2022, 97% of American teenagers aged 13\u201317 used the internet every day, with 46% responding they used the internet almost constantly.\nDel. C. T. Wilson (D-Charles) was one of the sponsors of the bill.\n\"Tonight's vote is a landmark moment for Maryland kids and families working toward a better, safer online world,\" said Todd Minor Sr. and Mia Minor, parent advocates from Accokeek who founded the Matthew E. Minor Awareness Foundation. \"We've worked hard for this moment, and we're super proud our legislators had the courage and determination to stand up to the Big Tech lobbyists in the hope that other families will never have to suffer pain like ours has endured.\"\nThe Matthew E. Minor Awareness Foundation was created after Matthew Minor died at 12 years old as a result of the \"choking/black-out\" challenge that had been circulating on social media and other internet platforms.\n\"Today's vote shows support for the Kids Code model's safety-by-design and privacy-by-default principles that transcends political divides, reflecting growing public recognition of the urgent need for smart, effective policy solutions to protect kids online,\" Maryland Kids Code Coalition spokeswoman Marisa Shea of St. Mary's County said.\nThe bill has wide-reaching support, with organizations like the Digital Harbor Foundation, the Free State PTA, the Maryland Association of School Health Nurses, the Maryland Coalition of Families and the Maryland State Education Association testifying in favor of it. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Workshop encourages becoming an informed weather spotter\n\n April 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 696\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For Warning Coordinator Meteorologist for the National Weather Service, Sarah Johnson, discussing weather's not just typical small talk.She deals in tornados, hail, high winds and severe storms all the time. As Marylanders escape winter weather, hopefully, there's a pause in the storm seasons.\nJune is considered the beginning of hurricane season and Johnson mentioned some things to stay alert to on the Eastern Shore.\nAt the Kent County Public Library on March 21, she introduced her audience to their program: SKYWARN.\nShe's looking for more and more people to become a spotter, who look out for the basics of thunderstorm development, storm structure and severe weather features, then report the information accurately.\n\"The main mission of the spotter is to be aware of the rapidly changing conditions of the weather,\" Johnson replied.\nAnd it's sorely needed too.\nJohnson said last year they reported the second most severe thunderstorms.\nThe third most for tornado warnings.\nAnd the fourth most in flash flood warnings.\nUnperturbed by the smaller audience in attendance, she was concise and enthusiastic while walking through the process of what to look out for.\nFor instance, people tend to be on high alert when they get something on their phone saying \"tornado warning.\" Not so much when they get a \"severe thunderstorm warning.\"\n\"That's a mistake to think one's worse than the other,\" Johnson commented.\nEspecially when water can be more harmful than wind in most cases, she said.\n\"When we look at the fatalities, 75% in the United States are due to water in some way; 50% of those are those are due to storm surge; 25% freshwater heavy rain flooding. Keep that in mind. Don't think, 'Oh, it's just a tropical storm.' No, you still need to pay attention and see what the hazards are.\"\nSevere storms should not be treated much differently than a tornado.\nShe then pointed out the difference between a storm watch and a storm warning. A watch means to keep an eye on the weather pattern.\nA warning means, don't just watch \u2014 get prepared.\nA severe storm warning means, gather up some candles for light, or buy extra gas for the back-up generator and do things that will prepare your family and yourself for a potential hazard.\nAs hurricanes emerge from the North Atlantic ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, Johnson reminded her audience how to categorize them and what that exactly means.\nHurricanes, big or small, she indicated, can create problems, such as tornados.\nThe uninformed, she added, might hear about a category 1 hurricane and think it's not much of a problem. They'll see it as a little rain and wind. Very minimal damage.\nThe savvy spotter though, will see that even a category 1 hurricane can create big problems, such as a tornado. The spotter will know category 1, simply describes the wind of the hurricane. Nothing else. It does not highlight the possibility of it creating tornados or other adverse weather conditions.\nAnd those who think tornados are only a threat in Kansas are in for a rude awakening.\nTornados hit everywhere, Johnson pointed out. Even in our backyard.\nShe said Hurricane Ida was a remnant tropical system that produced a lot of tornados in 2020.\nHurricane Isaias was a destructive Category 1 hurricane, producing the longest tracked tornado in Delaware history.\nTornados in Cecil County and Southern Delaware \u2014 resulted in fatalities last year.\n\"That's why we need you all,\" she said, encouraging her audience to report their observations to their nearest national weather station.\nTo become a spotter, adults are invited to complete the SKYWARN training.\nThose who finish the course join a volunteer program with between 350,000 and 400,000 trained severe weather spotters.\nIndividuals affiliated with hospitals, schools, churches and nursing homes or who have a responsibility for protecting others are encouraged to become a spotter.\n\"There can be no finer reward than to know that your efforts have given your family and neighbors the precious gift of time\u2014minutes that can help save lives,\" as stated by the NWS.\nAnd as the movie \"Twisters,\" the sequel to the original from 1996, comes out in theaters shortly, Johnson jokes that she's preparing to field a lot more questions about tornados.\nShe discouraged the crowd on becoming storm chasers like sensationalist Hollywood actors and actresses, but rather to become informed citizens who save lives. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A rough road: Students see bad choice consequences in mock crash\n\n April 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARTY MADDEN mmadden@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 579\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A statewide initiative to curb road fatalities continues to send a sobering message to Maryland's newest drivers.What began nationwide decades ago as a lesson in the dangers of blending alcohol with driving now includes in its scenario the sad consequences of not wearing seatbelts or allowing diversions such as cellphones and conversations to take a driver's attention away from the road.\nPublic high schools in Calvert County have annually been the venue for mock crashes. This year three of the high schools participated in crash scenarios with the aid and supervision of emergency responders and police.\nLast week's mock crash at Northern High began with the pretend scenario of a 17-year-old male, hosting a party at his home, hearing the sound of a two-vehicle crash down the fog-shrouded road leading from the house.\n\"I know them, they were just at my house,\" he tells 911.\nAccording to the scenario a female driving a truck is ejected and is soon pronounced dead at the scene.\nA smaller vehicle involved in the crash was operated by a young male who only suffers bruises but is later deemed impaired by alcohol and marijuana. A front seat passenger was not wearing a seatbelt and crews must extricate her from the vehicle. A rear seat passenger is assessed as unhurt but traumatized.\n\"Driving is a responsibility,\" Christy Nizer, Maryland's motor vehicle administrator, told the large group of Northern High students gathered around a back parking lot at the Owings school. \"You need to give your full attention to driving.\"\nNizer warned students that Maryland roads aren't getting any safer with all the distractions adding to the mix of things that can go wrong while traveling.\n\"We lost 600 people in motor vehicle crashes,\" Nizer said of Maryland's 2023 death toll. The number represents a 6% increase from the 2022 total.\nMany high school juniors are starting the transition from holding a learner's permit to being licensed to drive in Maryland.\nNizer and two other speakers \u2014 Christy Bliss, director of training for the Chesapeake Region Safety Council, and Calvert County Sheriff Ricky Cox (R) \u2014 acknowledged during remarks prior to the mock crash that many celebrations, including proms, graduations and parties will be taking place.\n\"You are the one behind the wheel,\" Bliss said, adding that she wanted students to think about, \"what it means to be distracted. What it means to not wear your seatbelt. We want you to make better thought choices. We want to see you in your senior year.\"\n\"I've had to make notifications to parents that their child won't be coming home tonight,\" Cox said.\nOn the subject of impairment, Nizer that there are \"new consequences\" for all drivers that are cited for impaired driving. Legislation passed this year by the Maryland General Assembly expands the state's ignition interlock system program to include those granted probation before judgement for impairment while transporting minors under the age of 16.\nMotorists with court-ordered ignition interlock systems in a vehicle blow into a device in order to get a vehicle to start.\nIn addition to the Calvert County Sheriff's Office and the Maryland State Police, volunteers from local fire and rescue also provided a demonstration of procedures in responding to vehicle crashes. Narration of the crash scenario was provided by Joe DellaCamera, a Metropolitan Police officer, volunteer firefighter and former chief of the Prince Frederick Volunteer Fire Department.\nCoordination of the local mock crashes was done by Debbie Jennings, a Calvert County resident who serves as the region safety council's director of highway safety and special projects. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'He snapped': Maryland teacher sentenced to probation for assaulting doorbell pranksters\n\n June 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1555\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A Rising Sun High School teacher who has served as an educator for 30 years received a suspended six-month sentence and was placed on 15 months of supervised probation Wednesday, after pleading guilty to assaulting a 13-year-old boy after the child and a friend pranked him at his residence.The defendant, Dylan M. Aiman, 54, of Rising Sun, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault, a misdemeanor that is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. In exchange, prosecutors dismissed related charges of reckless endangerment and false imprisonment.\nCecil County District Court Administrative Judge Bonnie G. Schneider rejected a defense request to grant Aiman probation-before-judgement, commonly known as a PBJ \u2014 a verdict in which the presiding judge finds the defendant guilty and then sets aside the conviction, meaning the conviction will not appear on that person's record.\nA PBJ reportedly would have been more favorable for Aiman when the Cecil County Public Schools administration decides on his future employment.\nAssistant State's Attorney Joseph Verratti told the judge that he would not object to Aiman receiving a PBJ.\nAiman's defense lawyer, Thomas C. Morrow of Towson, told the judge that Aiman is on administrative leave, a status that school officials assigned Aiman shortly after a Rising Sun Police Department officer filed criminal charges against him in the wake of the early-May incident.\nJoseph Buckley, who is the CCPS associate superintendent for administrative services, told the Cecil Whig on Thursday, \"We are aware of the legal matter that's facing one of our employees and we're going to follow all of our human resources processes to access the situation to address the matter. We'll be working with the employee to address the matter. Other than that, at this point, we really have no further comment.\"\nBuckley noted that CCPS officials are not at liberty to release specific information concerning personnel matters.\nFrom the bench, Schneider opined Wednesday that a PBJ verdict would not be appropriate because, according to information provided by the prosecution, Aiman was convicted of failure to obey a peace order in 2012, some 12 years ago. (Aiman reportedly had been granted a PBJ in that 2012 case, which stemmed from a dispute with a neighbor, and he violated the peace order when he entered his neighbor's yard to retrieve as Nerf lawn dart that his son had shot onto that property.)\nElecting to still accept the plea deal, knowing that the judge would not grant him a PBJ, Aiman pleaded guilty to second-degree assault. Then, after Verratti read aloud the statement of facts, Schneider found Aiman guilty of that offense and imposed a suspended six-month sentence on him. (Verratti had recommended a suspended one-year sentence, one year of supervised probation, an anger management class and no contact with the victims in the proffered plea agreement.)\nIn addition, the judge ordered Aiman to serve 15 months of supervised probation. Schneider acknowledged that Aiman already had successfully completed an anger management class since the incident occurred. The judge, however, ordered Aiman to take another anger management course if his probation officer deems that it is necessary.\nThe judge also ordered Aiman to have no contact with the two victims, one of whom turned 14 about three weeks after the incident.\nMoments before sentencing, Aiman stood at the defense table, reflected on the incident and told the judge, \"I clearly way overreacted.\"\nHis words echoed ones uttered moments earlier by Morrow, who reported that Aiman has an unblemished employment record during his 30 years as an educator, the last 24 of which in Cecil County, and that he is a RSHS biology teacher, one who teaches predominantly honors classes, in addition to that subject at other levels.\nMorrow advocated for an outcome in the criminal case that might result in the \"salvaging of his (Aiman's) career.\"\nTHE INCIDENT\nAiman chased the two boys in the early evening of May 4, which was a Saturday, after they rang the doorbell at his residence in the 200 block of Turtleneck Court and ran away \u2014 a prank known as \"ding dong ditch.\"\nAfter catching the teens across the street from his home, Aiman forced them back to his front porch, where he made the boys wait for police officers to respond after calling authorities and making a harassment complaint, according to court records.\nRSPD Pfc. Cunningham and Patrolman Moore responded to the scene at 7:32 p.m., and Aiman told them that he \"gripped one up,\" referring to one of the teens. Aiman maintained that he gave chase after the second time that the ding-dong-ditch prank had been pulled at his residence that evening.\nIn the courtroom Wednesday, the prosecutor reported that Aiman grabbed one of the boys by his sweatshirt, lifted him up by the garment and kneed him in the ribs. Verratti also reported that Aiman handled the situation in \"an aggressive manner,\" which included him yelling at the boys.\nCunningham informed Aiman that \"he could not put his hands on juveniles and that it does classify as an assault,\" according to court records.\n\"(Aiman) did not seem to understand, asking what he was supposed to do \u2014 let them run away. (Aiman) continually stated that he just held the kids on his front porch until the police arrived,\" court records show.\nAiman did not know the boys, who live in his neighborhood, according to the defense.\nInvestigators filed charges of second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and false imprisonment against Aiman on May 5, a day after the incident, and served him the criminal summons on May 6, court records show. He was released on personal recognizance.\n'HE SNAPPED'\nMorrow maintained that the incident was an aberration.\nHe reported that Aiman served as a soccer coach for RSHS boys and girls teams and as a coach for Cecil County Department of Parks and Recreation youth soccer teams, in addition to his 30-year career as a teacher, and that he received no official complaints.\nThe defense lawyer also told the judge that Aiman and his family have been the target of harassment in the Rising Sun community by unknown people for an unspecified long time, with encroachments including people hurling eggs at the Aiman house \u2014 which required professional cleaning \u2014 and cars and placing \"anonymous threats in his mailbox.\".\nAiman reported those incidents to police \"multiple times\" in the past, but nothing was done, Morrow said. Officers told Aiman that it would be difficult for law enforcement to take action unless he was able to identify the culprit or culprits, he added.\n(Speculating on why Aiman was harassed, Morrow told the judge that Aiman is \"a good teacher\" who teaches biology at a high level, which can be difficult and frustrating for students. Aside from the two boys who admitted to playing the May 4 ding-dong-ditch prank at Aiman's home, however, no one has been identified as a perpetrator of the previous purported pranks and harassment directed at him and his family.)\nAiman caught the teens and held them on his porch until officers arrived because he wanted parents and authorities involved, according to Morrow.\n\"It was not his intent to injure anyone,\" Morrow said, stressing that Aiman told one of the boys, \"I want you to call your father right now,\" after escorting the teens to his porch.\n\"His only intent was to get some kind of parental involvement to end this trend of harassment,\" Morrow said.\nThe defense lawyer also emphasized that Aiman is \"facing potential dismissal and the loss of his teaching certificate\" after 30 years as an educator.\nAiman's wife spoke on his behalf, telling the judge that her husband's action on May 4 was uncharacteristic. She blamed his response on the frustration and weariness of enduring pranks and various types of harassment over the years. She and Aiman have been married for 24 years.\nShe opined that a family's home should feel like \"a safe place,\" one that provides \"peace, a respite,\" before maintaining that the prolonged harassment had eroded her family's sense of tranquility and that the ding-dong-ditch prank on May 4 pushed her husband to his limit.\n\"He snapped. He had enough,\" Aiman's wife said.\nShe commented, \"He's a great man, a loving father and a great husband . . . He's remorseful and sick about it (the incident).\"\nAiman, who has six children, apologized to the two victims, their families, his own family, the school system and county parks and recreation moments before sentencing.\n\"I let all of them down, including myself,\" Aiman said. \"I worked with kids to give them a positive experience in the classroom and on the soccer field.\"\nHe also alluded to the question hanging over his career in education, remarking, \"Teaching is very important to me.\"\nA LEVEL OF LEADERSHIP\nThe father of the boy whom Aiman picked up and kneed in the ribs told the judge that he was surprised when he learned that Aiman was a teacher.\n\"He's trained to deal with kids, to show a level of leadership. He should be someone to look up to,\" the father said. \"It's concerning to me that this man is employed by the school.\"\nThe mother of the other boy also addressed the judge. She acknowledged that, although Aiman did not aggressively touch her son to the level that he did to her son's friend, the interaction with Aiman negatively impacted her son. She contended that Aiman yelled threateningly.\nAccording to the woman, her son was afraid to walked into a store by himself one day after the incident. \"I'm concerned how quickly he went into anger,\" she said of Aiman. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

School officials noted that EHS football games average roughly 1,200 attendees, and other fall sports games can bring in 300 to 400.\n\"We are introducing the CEIA OPENGATE weapons detection system to enhance the security measures and safety for our students, staff, and community alike,\" Elkton High School Principal Dr. James Leitgeb wrote in a letter to EHS parents and guardians. \"This advanced security technology is a walk-through detection system designed to identify and prevent unauthorized or potentially harmful items from being brought onto our campus.\"\nThe new system is consistent with Elkton High School's strict policy banning weapons on school grounds for any reason.\nLeitgeb noted that the system is portable, and the school plans to make use of it beyond the fall sports season.\n\"We are doing this for our fall events, and eventually we do plan on using [the system] for our indoor winter games,\" said Leitgeb.\nThe OPENGATE system is comprised of two upright detectors that will be placed at the entrance to the stadium, which will likely look familiar to those who have gone to a professional sports game or concert recently. CEIA, an Ohio-based metal detector manufacturer, touts that the system scans bags and backpacks automatically, allowing lines to proceed through the gates faster.\n\"This system is highly effective yet minimally intrusive, allowing students, staff, and visitors to enter school premises without significant delays or disruptions,\" Leitgeb said.\nThe implementation of the system is part of a partnership between EHS and Elkton Police Department. According to Leitgeb, EHS staff will man the gates and, in the event of any alerts from the system, EPD officers and the School Resource Officer will be on hand to help handle the situation.\n\"One of my highest priorities as principal is the safety of our students and guests,\" Leitgeb said. \"This is true not only during the school day, but at night time events as well.\"\nLeitgeb also noted that the purchase of the system is part of a grant-funded pilot program and, if successful, other schools in Cecil County will make use of similar systems.\nThe detection system was slated to make its debut at Elkton's home football opener on Sept. 6 at the school's stadium. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The incident involved three students and one staff member and ended with a student being transported to a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.According to a press release released by the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, the assault happened on Tuesday afternoon. The videos paint a picture of the incident, though no further official statement has been released by law enforcement on the assault.\nIn the videos, a group of students are circling around the three students involved in the assault. Seconds into the video, one student in a black hoodie moves toward a student in a red hoodie and assaults him. The student in red falls to the floor. Immediately following, an additional student in a gray hoodie proceeds to join in the assault.\nIn the video, a male staff member in a white shirt attempts to protect the student that is being assaulted and physically puts his body on top of the student, seemingly to act as a barrier between the students.\nThe other two students seemingly continue to assault the student in red and begin to also assault the staff member. Soon after, other staff members intervene and separate the students and defuse the situation. The incident lasted around 30 seconds.\nDeputies were able to identify two victims of the assault, one was an Easton High School staff member and the second was a student of the school. No identities have been released, and the incident is currently under investigation.\nThe assault resulted in one student being transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton via Talbot County Department of Emergency Services to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\nThe two other students in the video were identified and arrested in relation to the assault.\nAccording to a statement from Debbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools, the event is being evaluated and those involved will face appropriate disciplinary action.\n\"The safety of our students and staff is always our top priority. We are grateful for our partnership with the Talbot County Sheriff's Office and the presence of School Resource Officers in our schools,\" the statement said. \"Deputy Horseman, along with several other Sheriff's deputies and members of the Easton High staff responded quickly to contain the incident. The students involved will face appropriate disciplinary action, and we are continuously evaluating safety measures to prevent or mitigate incidents of this nature.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said the threat is a photo of a \"clearly\" photoshopped Instagram message that includes the 410 area code.\n\"We're taking it very seriously, as we do every threat,\" Gamble said, adding that, through investigation, the Sheriff's Office doesn't think there is \"any viable threat to the safety\" of TCPS students.\nAccording to a letter from the district addressed to TCPS families, the district is \"closely monitoring the situation\" and working with local authorities. The letter says that school operations will continue as normal.\nGamble said a criminal investigation by the Sheriff's Office is underway. He said all school resource officers in the district are aware of the threat, and extra deputies are patrolling.\nOn Friday, TCPS students were put in a modified lockdown following a threatening social media post made that morning. According to the Sheriff's Office, the threat originated outside of the United States and similar threats were made to schools in Easton, Pennsylvania.\nGamble said the Sheriff's officer is aware of jurisdictions in other states that \"have had 40 or 50 of these types of threats.\"\n\"It's happening all over our country where, for whatever reason, somebody is trying to disrupt school operations and put our kids in fear,\" he said.\nGamble said that a few years back, the district experienced something similar where about half a dozen non-specific threats were made during the course of the school year. He said he would expect to see more of these threats this year.\n\"This just seems like the thing to do these days for some reason,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After that, the K-9 units were invited to the Kent County Middle School to receive something special.\nIn a gesture of police support, the Kent Puppy Pals 4-H Dog Club donated a Line of fire Defense Street Fighter vest to Addy, a German Shepherd, handled by Dfc. Craig Lewis of the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office.\nGoing through Kent County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Scott Lockerman's organization, the Maryland Police K9 Foundation, the Puppy Pals donated a check for $300 in June.\nClub Leader of Puppy Pals Kim Montooth explained each year they do a service project. Last year, for instance, they raised money for the Humane Society. This year was exciting for the kids and something different, Montooth said.\nMolly's Place also donated $1,000 in a vest for Waylon, a K-9 black lab handled by Pfc. Nick Lang of the Easton Police Department.\nIn front of about 20 people, the dogs modeled the vests, which are lightweight enough yet specially designed to protect their vital organs.\nThen the Puppy Pals kids and their families gathered around to pet the dogs.\nAfter the children met with the dogs and 4-H mom Karri Bryant had a playful tug of war with Addy, they were invited into the school where they witnessed a live demonstration of how Addy sniffs out controlled substances.\nControlled substances were stashed in two classrooms. Led by Lewis, sniffing desks and drawers, Addy alerted to the controlled substance in both rooms in about 30 seconds.\nTrainer Mark Carr of Tidewater Strategic Services said the dog doesn't go right to the spot because of the nature of scent itself. The K-9 moves around the perimeter of the room, getting the entire scent. Once she gets a complete picture, she can hone in.\nPresident of the club Trenton Montooth was impressed. At 14 years of age, he has decided he wants to be a K-9 officer.\nLockerman thanked the Puppy Pals and Molly's Place, expressing the importance of their giving by showing the positive impact K-9 dogs make.\n\"K-9's make the community safer with their presence. Crime rates go down. Schools are much safer. Even the town's property values go up,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Instead, the program keys on the behavior aspect.\n\"We really want to make sure that we're giving these clear (messages) to children to focus on the behavior and how somebody makes us feel or what they're asking us to do, as opposed to the relationship,\" Quillet said.\nIn the children's portion of the program, children were encouraged to identify five trusted adults. Quillet encouraged parents and guardians to \"be comfortable that (they) might not be the person that (children) come to for everything.\"\nHaving trusted adults in different spaces is important not just for young children but also teenagers, Quillet noted. With the dangers of technology and the internet, she said the 12- to 17-year-old age range is \"more vulnerable than ever.\"\n\"We see a lot of things locally that revolve around technology and often used as a grooming practice,\" she said.\nAt the end of the hourlong presentation, Quillet said parents should stay involved in their children's activities and choose caregivers carefully.\n\"There should never be a time where I'm not allowed to have access to my children or I'm not allowed to watch them,\" she said. \"\u2026 Screen all your caregivers carefully.

    "content": "Bus driver likely to face charges after abandoning students at the wrong bus stop\n\n October 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 733\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A bus driver for Newark Charter School in Delaware is expected to face charges after 10 elementary school students were abandoned at the wrong bus stop.The incident happened Tuesday afternoon as Bus #28 was driving the students home for the day. School officials called police at approximately 4:15 p.m. to report the incident, according to Sgt. Joseph Conover, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department.\nThe driver made the students \u2014 ranging from kindergarten to fifth grade \u2014 get off the bus at a stop in Robscott Manor, which is not their normal stop, Conover said.\nA parent waiting for her child at that stop realized that extra students exited the bus and called the school and police to report the incident.\nSchool officials and officers from the Newark and New Castle County police departments all rushed to Robscott Manor, where they found the students safe.\n\"The cooperative efforts between Newark Charter School, the Newark Police Department and its law enforcement partners ensured the safe reunification of all of the students with their guardians,\" Conover said.\nState troopers tracked down the bus and confirmed that there were no more students aboard.\nConover said Newark's school resource officers are still interviewing students and families but he expects the driver to be arrested and charged with multiple offenses.\nPolice are still trying to figure out exactly why the students were told to get out in Robscott Manor. The neighborhood is on the bus route, but some of those students live a significant distance away from where they were dropped off, Conover said.\nThe mother of one of the affected students told the Newark Post she was waiting for her child to come home and was tracking the bus via an app that parents have access to. She began to get concerned when the bus was late and she saw on the GPS tracking app that the bus was going in the wrong direction.\nShe then got a call from the parent who witnessed the kids get kicked off the bus, and she went to Robscott to pick up her child.\nShe started to piece together what happened by talking to her son.\n\"He said they were at a stop, and the bus driver said 'Everybody get off the bus. Get your stuff and get off,'\" recounted the mother, who asked not to be identified out of concern for her child's safety.\nSome of the children were confused and scared and refused to get off, she added. At the next stop on the same street, the driver again told them it's the last stop and they had to get off, and the remaining students eventually complied.\nShe said she told her son she was proud of him for helping his younger classmates.\n\"It's just a crazy thing, but I do feel like the kids really stuck together and they kind of took care of each other,\" she said. \"I think that made a lot of the parents feel better.\"\nShe also praised school officials for reacting quickly to ensure the students were safe.\nThe mother said she has decided to let her child continue to ride the bus, but she will be more alert about knowing who is driving her child.\n\"You don't really think about who is it that's driving the bus,\" she said. \"You don't really see them a whole lot. You just kind of let your kid get on, and there they are.\"\nThe incident has taught her to be more vigilant about talking to her child about what happens during bus rides.\n\"A big takeaway with all the parents is just to kind of watch out a little bit more and try to notice if things do seem strange and having your kid be able to tell you if things seem off,\" she said.\nThe driver, whose name has not yet been made public, is an employee of Advanced Student Transportation, the bus company Newark Charter has contracted with since the school opened 23 years ago.\n\"Yesterday's incident was unfortunate and we are tremendously disappointed that it occurred,\" Head of School Sam Golder wrote in a letter to parents. \"The bus driver will no longer be driving for Newark Charter School.\"\nGolder assured parents the school is fully cooperating with the police investigation.\n\"Student safety is, and will continue to be, our number one priority at Newark Charter School,\" he said. \"I personally have three children of my own and I would not have tolerated yesterday's behavior, had my children been riding this bus.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Resource officers already serving the school district fall under the direction and budget of the county sheriff's office.\nThe statewide grant funding assists in supplementing law enforcement coverage for public schools with $10 to 15 million in FY26 and $20 million in FY27 and each year thereafter, he said.\nAs school security is considered a top state priority, a minimum three years of funding following this year is secured, according to Saboury.\n\"So really that's putting additional eyes and ears in our schools, which is a wonderful thing,\" he said.\nAs a member of the district, the SSE works more closely with school leaders on safety measures, often outside law enforcement scopes, and are more closely involved with student behavior, support and providing intervention to mitigate and prevent harm, he said.\nAs district employees, QACPS has the flexibility to utilize SSEs for after school sporting events or field trips Saboury said.\n\"It's a great resource that the school district has never had before,\" he said.\nSSEs are held to the same standards and certification programs through the Maryland for School Safety Model training as SROs.\nTraining, uniforms, equipment and overtime are all budgeted into the grant with no cost the district, he said.\nWith the potential for increased funding down the road, Saboury was hopeful to be able to build the program and continually create a safe learning environment for students. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat.

Her recommendations included reducing the speed limit and putting in a crosswalk and extra signage.\n\"Her proactive approach to avoid a potential hazard and commitment to create (a) safe environment is essential in reducing traffic-related incidents,\" the commendation read.\nDorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said he received a call from Wanex, who told him there was no safe crosswalk at the high school for students who walk home from school.\nPfeffer said he was surprised by what Wanex told him because he knows there are students who walk home from school.\n\"So we had people look into it,\" he said.\nWith the help of Dorchester County Sheriff's Deputy Steve Mills and county staff, they were able to get the issue resolved, Pfeffer said.\n\"Thanks to Aubrey here, there's now a safe crosswalk,\" he said.\nPfeffer and the County Council weren't the only ones who thanked Wanex during the meeting. Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson congratulated Wanex and said her actions are a testament to the good things that many Dorchester County students do for the community.\n\"This is just one example of Aubrey doing a great job for the community and her school,\" he said. \"I thank you and commend you myself. Keep up the good work at North Dorchester High School.\"\nWanex told those at the meeting that when she made the decision to reach out to the county about the issue, she was thinking about the future kids that will have to walk home from school. She said she had an experience where she nearly got hit by a car on Cloverdale Road.\n\"And I was just kind of upset about the fact that there was no crosswalk for kids that walk,\" she said.\nPfeffer thanked Wanex for reaching out to him and encouraged other young people to do the same if they have issues or concerns.\n\"We don't bite,\" he said about the County Council. \"We love to hear from you. I mean, you are the future of this county.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Ground broken for state-of-the-art first responder training facility in Easton\n\n December 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 649\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 First responders, along with local and state officials, broke ground Monday on a state-of-the-art emergency services training facility in Easton.The A. James Clark Emergency Services Training Campus is being constructed on Mistletoe Drive. The 7,200-square-foot facility is intended to allow for cross-training between emergency responders and reduce long commutes for first responders in training.\nBrett Whitehead, president of the Friends of Easton Volunteer Fire Department, co-led the fundraising campaign for the facility with his partner, Ed Forte. Whitehead said on Monday that the campus will be in a world of its own as far as allowing firefighters, police officers, EMS workers and others to train together.\n\"There's no place that I know of \u2026 in the Mid-Shore where three of the legs, if you will, of emergency services can practice together,\" Whitehead said.\nThe closest training facilities are in Princess Anne and Centreville, Whitehead noted. Whitehead believes the Easton facility can be the premier cross-training facility in the region.\n\"We want to be the Taj Mahal,\" he said. \"We want to be the mecca of education for all emergency services as it relates to what we do.\"\nThe campus will have a public safety building and an educational building with classrooms, as well as a 1,500-square-foot concrete pad for car fire and extrication training. Hostage rescues, ladder climbs and traffic safety situations are other ways in which the facilities will be used.\nLeaders from across public safety agencies attended Monday's groundbreaking, including Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble, Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey and Talbot County Director of Emergency Services Brian LeCates.\nLeCates said the facility will be a \"more professional setting\" for collaborating and training to take place. That setting could end up saving lives, he said.\n\"We all know that every second counts,\" LeCates said. \"In real emergencies, lives are at stake, and the difference between success and failure often comes to how we train before the disaster occurs.\"\n\"At least 90% of the calls that we go on involve all three groups,\" Whitehead said. \" \u2026 It allows us to all hone our skills together. And that's the magic of what we're trying to get done. Hopefully in 12 months, we'll have this facility built.\"\nFUNDRAISINGThus far, around $4 million of the $5 million goal has been raised for the A. James Clark Emergency Services Training Campus.\nAs the name indicates, the A. James & Alice B. Clark Foundation and its Board Chair Courtney Clark Pastrick were fundamental in that fundraising success. Last September, the foundation gave $1 million to the fundraising efforts for the training campus. In total, the foundation has contributed $1.9 million to the project.\n\"I don't think I've ever encountered someone as professional and, as my wife reminds me, gracious, as Courtney Clark Pastrick,\" Whitehead said.\nClark Pastrick said she knew the project was a \"perfect fit,\" something her late father, A. James Clark, would be immensely proud of. She thanked all the community members and sponsors who donated to the project in tandem with the foundation.\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said the state House and Senate chambers each contributed $150,000 to the project, a charge led by Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio, a former Republican legislator and Department of Natural Resources secretary.\nFormer Easton Mayor Bob Willey attended the groundbreaking event, adorned with his fellow firefighters in Easton Volunteer Fire Department gear. Mautz, Whitehead and Mayor Megan Cook each thanked Willey for having the original vision to bring a project like this to life.\n\"This is going to go so far as to improving our fire service, but most importantly, to make it safer, so more people will join the fire service,\" Mautz said.\n\"And it is no surprise to me that our very own 62-year veteran of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, Mayor Willey, was the one who sparked this idea. Mayor Willey, we owe you an incredible debt of gratitude,\" he said.\nThis report has been updated to correct the name of the training facility. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In an email to The Star Democrat, the district said the arrest did not take place at the school.\nSchool and police officials say rumors of a parent being detained while dropping off a child at the elementary school are false.\nRepresentatives of the Easton Police Department added that the arrest was made due to outstanding warrants for an individual in town and not as a result of any directive from the new presidential administration. EPD officers were not involved in the arrest, but the department contacted the Department of Homeland Security following the incident as rumors began to circulate.\nAs of Monday, the Talbot school district had not communicated with families regarding the rumors, though counseling and mental health support for students, families and staff has been made available. TCPS' Director of Communications Debbie Gardner said in an email that the district has reviewed its existing protocols around \"actions or inquiries by law enforcement.\"\nLast week, State Superintendent Carey Wright sent a letter to Maryland superintendents outlining the practices school employees should take if immigration authorities enter schools.\n\"If federal immigration officials or law enforcement enter a school building seeking access to students (for interviews and/or questioning), school personnel should contact the local superintendent immediately for guidance,\" Wright wrote on Jan. 23.\n\"School personnel should not argue or debate with immigration enforcement officials but should direct them to the local superintendent or designated administrator for further action,\" the letter read.\nWright's letter comes as Donald Trump's immigration initiatives have brought sweeping policy changes since the inauguration last Monday.\nA directive last week from the Trump administration reversed a policy that established places such as schools, churches and shelters as \"protected areas.\" That policy discouraged immigration enforcement agents from conducting arrests in those areas.\n\"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest,\" Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Benjamine Huffman stated. \"The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.\"\nIn her letter, Wright said that if immigration officials request student records, local schools should consult with their attorneys.\n\"Personnel should immediately notify the student's parent or guardian if an immigration official or law enforcement officer requests or gains access to a student for immigration-enforcement purposes,\" Wright stated, \"unless such access was following a judicial warrant or subpoena that restricts the disclosure of the information to the parent or guardian.\"\nIn a statement, Talbot County Public Schools said that superintendents across the state had a meeting with Wright, as well as the Maryland ICE director. The district is following guidance from the Maryland Department of Education on immigration enforcement actions.\nRegarding the Easton arrest, a spokesperson for Enforcement and Removal Operations' Baltimore field office did not provide specific information on the arrest or if other arrests in the area have occurred in the past week. Enforcement and Removal Operations is a directorate of ICE.\n\"ERO Baltimore works daily to prioritize public safety by arresting and removing undocumented alien offenders who pose the greatest threat to our communities, to include those with serious criminal convictions who have violated our nation's immigration laws,\" an email statement read. \"By focusing on these high-priority cases, we aim to uphold the integrity of our immigration system while promoting the safety and security of Maryland's residents.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Using emergency power from generators and solar panels, they communicated with 145 stations \u2014 18 were amateur radio satellites.\nWith a refurbished school bus and a camper, they operated from five stations, classified as mobile, including the emergency trailer EMCOMM 1, which contained equipment from the school's ham radio classes taught by WKHS station manager Chris Singleton, a KARS member for 30 years.\nEMCOMM 1 serves as backup when regular emergency dispatch fails.\nThis was part of the American Radio Relay League's Winter Field Day training exercise. Radio operators set up field operations in remote locations \"with the aim to improve their preparedness for disasters, enhancing their operational abilities in adverse conditions.\"\nFor KARS members, ham radio is a lifelong passion, but disaster preparation remains the priority.\nKARS President Chris Cote cited Hurricane Irma in September 2017, when 7.5 million homes lost electricity. Ham radio could become the only communication mode in such situations.\nInside Cote's bus, three stations operate off a 12-volt battery charging from a solar array \u2014 two radio with VHF/UHF capabilities and one satellite communications. They reached operators nationwide without external power all weekend.\nThe event reached young people when Singleton's KCHS broadcasting students operated the ham radio. Junior, Jordana Capp, in her second year of broadcasting, contacted Washington state over a Russian satellite connection.\nJunior, Aidan Maxey, also in his second broadcasting year, made contact with New York. He plans to pursue media studies at Syracuse, impressed with the program.\nSenior, Alayna Brown, featured on Radio World's Jan. 1 cover, contacted Tennessee. Brown, already certified by the Society of Broadcast Engineers, was recently accepted to Belmont in Nashville, where she plans to work with multitrack recording systems, live stage and master tapes.\nAll three students became interested in ham radio certification after attending the ARRL School Round up on Oct. 21. Brown had communicated with Russia during that event.\nSingleton celebrated his students' interest in this vital skill. He had worked for 15 years to engage youth in ham radio, noting that combining broadcasting skills, live audio, music production and SBE certification opens many career paths.\n\"They are amazed,\" Singleton said. \"They don't get many opportunities to work with this very specialized equipment. It is a rare opportunity.\"\nKARS members continue generating youth interest in ham radio by teaching them radio operating skills and attending the Winter Field Day Contest. They anticipate the ARRL School Club Roundup Contest Feb. 10-14 as well.\nOn Sunday, as Cote's drone photographed their stations, KARS member Bobby Kelley helped newest member Alberto Larotonda dismantle his homemade antenna built from a ski pole, copper pipes and a drywall mud bucket.\n\"My little setup just shows anybody can do this with enough imagination,\" said Larotonda, who joined two months ago.\nCote said while no one wants to think disasters like those in California or North Carolina will strike locally, testing equipment in harsh conditions benefits the county; ensuring first responders that it is battle-tested.\nFor more information about KARS, visit k3ars.org/kars/. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025",

    "content": "Court docs: Delaware middle school teacher spent months grooming student online with sexual messages\n\n March 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 681\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Delaware court documents released Tuesday shed new light on how a Kirk Middle School teacher allegedly spent months grooming one of his students by sending her sexual messages and fantasies through an online chat application.Ultimately, the inappropriate behavior expanded to school grounds, where David DiFilippo would spend time alone with the 13-year-old girl in his classroom, making sexual comments to her and, on one occasion, touching her legs, court records allege.\nDiFilippo's actions \"are clearly and reasonably indicative of an adult grooming and enticing a minor for the purpose of sexual contact and/or a sexual experience,\" Detective Marc Conway, of the Delaware State Police, wrote in court documents, adding that DiFilippo was trying to build up trust with the girl to \"ultimately entice and arouse her sexually.\"\nDiFilippo's alleged behavior took place between September 2023 and February 2024, when DiFilippo was 43 and 44 years old.\nDuring that six-month period, DiFilippo and the girl chatted nearly every day over Discord, a messaging app. The messages were \"flirtatious and sexual in nature,\" and DiFilippo suggested sexual acts with the girl, made comments about her body and clothing and referred to her as \"babe\" and \"baby,\" court records show.\nHe sent her several stories detailing explicit sexual fantasies involving her engaging in sexual intercourse, masturbation and oral sex. He would then ask the girl \"if the writings were good enough that she could picture them in her mind and if reading them made her feel a certain way,\" court documents allege.\nOne story involved a teacher and a student having sexual relations on a school bus during a field trip, and DiFilippo then told the girl he was planing a field trip and asked if she would like to sit with him on the bus, court records indicate.\nDiFilippo would delete the messages after the girl read them, but she kept screenshots of the messages on her phone.\nDiFilippo's behavior eventually extended into in-person encounters, and he would allow the girl to skip class to hang out with him alone in his classroom during his planning period when he did not have a class to teach. Other times, she would stay in his classroom after class ended and the other students left.\nOn one occasion, DiFilippo told the girl he liked her \"milky white thighs\" and said seeing them made him feel \"like an animal ready to attack his prey,\" court documents allege. Another time, he suggested they go into a closet to kiss, but the girl refused. On a different day, the girl brought DiFilippo an assortment of snack food and asked him which he liked best, to which he replied he liked \"the snack in the dress,\" presumably referring to her.\nCourt records describe one incident in which DiFilippo's behavior turned physical. The girl was sitting on a counter near his desk, and DiFilippo allegedly knelt down and rubbed her legs. The girl told him to stop, which he did.\nIt's not clear why DiFilippo's behavior ended in February 2024. Court records indicate that the girl told her therapist about it in August 2024, sparking a police investigation.\nThe girl provided police with screenshots of DiFilippo's Discord messages, and detectives later subpoenaed Discord for a transcript of the messages sent from his account. Investigators interviewed the girl with help from the Child Advocacy Center in Wilmington.\nDiFilippo turned himself in to police in February after the months-long investigation.\nHe was charged with sexual solicitation of a child, enticement for purposes of sexual conduct, dangerous crime against a minor, promoting sexual solicitation of a child, providing obscenity material to a child, sexual abuse of a child by a person of trust and offensive touching. He was released after posting $65,500 secured bond.\nPolice asked anyone with information or who may be a victim to contact Conway at 302-365-8411.\nAccording to a brief biography posted on Kirk's website, DiFilippo taught in the gifted and talented program and has been a teacher for approximately 15 years. He wrote that his favorite part of the job is \"forming strong bonds and relationships with my students.\"\nA spokesperson for the Christina School District did not respond to a request for comment. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Students complete inaugural Talbot County Sheriff's Office police academy\n\n March 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 481\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Students in grades 10 through 12 graduated from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office inaugural citizens police academy Tuesday night.In a 10-week course that met every Tuesday, officers provided students an inside look at the law enforcement field, teaching topics such as crisis response, bleeding emergencies and traffic stops.\nSaints Peter & Paul sophomore Carson Tyree said the academy changed his perspective of police work.\n\"What stood out is how these guys work. It's not all fun and games,\" Tyree said. \" \u2026 When they go into a situation, there's a lot of thinking behind it because they can't violate procedure. If they violate procedure, they can't be a police officer.\"\nJunior Canin Parks said he took the academy to learn more about law enforcement since he is considering entering the field. His favorite week was the virtual reality simulator, during which students were posed with the virtual task of helping people in distress.\nJules Stepp, a Saints Peter & Paul junior, most enjoyed learning about Talbot County's crisis response unit, or SWAT team. Students were shown the inside of a SWAT van and learned about the materials and techniques used in situations that call for crisis response.\n\"It was like we were there with them,\" Stepp said. \"We got to live vicariously through them.\"\nStepp said she recommends the academy to anyone interested. The academy made it clear the extreme level of detail that policing requires, she said.\n\"I was surprised how much detail went into every little thing, and how one little thing can cause a problem so they had to backtrack and think about what the consequences could be,\" she said. \"And how they have to go through so many processes to get grants, peace orders, protective orders and all that type of stuff.\"\nFollowing Tuesday's 10th and final class, Maj. Steve Elliott thanked the students and called them a \"great group\" for the first ever citizens police academy. Lt. J.R Dobson said it was a fun 10 weeks.\n\"I think from day one \u2014 when (Sheriff Joe Gamble) was giving you guys a lesson on when the first sheriff of Talbot County was \u2014 until now, I've seen you all loosen up,\" Dobson said.\nGamble thanked Lori Stepp, the grants administrator for the Sheriff's Office, for procuring a grant to make the police academy possible.\nThe Talbot County Sheriff's Office is now fielding applications for its second citizens police academy. This round is open to county residents 18 and older. Classes are held every Tuesday for 10 weeks beginning April 8. Applications are open until March 31.\nGraduates of the inaugural Talbot County Sheriff's Office citizens police academy:\nYvonne Herrera Hernandez, North Caroline High School.\nIan Knopp, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nEric Loredo, Easton High School.\nSofia Miller, St. Michaels Middle High School.\nCanin Parks, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nJules Stepp, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nCarson Tyree, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nEvelio Urdaneta Delgado, Easton High School. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was transported to Shock Trauma in Baltimore for treatment of life-threatening injuries. He died on Wednesday afternoon, his family said on Facebook Thursday.\nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday, Darren's father, Len Foxwell, wrote that the family is \"eternally grateful for everyone who has sent their love and support, for those who have stepped up with profound gestures of support, and for Darren's friends who drove here from Easton yesterday to say goodbye to their childhood buddy.\"\n\"Each of you have been a lifeline and have honored Darren in your own special way,\" Len Foxwell wrote.\nHis father added that the team at Shock Trauma in Baltimore \"fought like a tiger to keep Darren comfortable, preserve his dignity and provide solace for a family that has been destroyed.\"\nA member of Easton High School's wrestling and lacrosse teams, Foxwell graduated last month. He planned to attend Bethany College in West Virginia this fall and play lacrosse for the Bison.\nFoxwell played the last two years for Easton as a backup defenseman. Easton High boys head lacrosse coach Dennis Keenan said he was popular among his teammates and had a \"bright future.\"\n\"I think he was funnier than he actually thought he was,\" Keenan said. \"The things he would say would just crack me up. He was getting better each day. You could see flashes of brilliance.\"\nFoxwell wrestled for three years at Easton, including under head coach Jason Biringer during his senior year. Biringer said Foxwell had an \"infectious\" personality.\nEarly this past season, Foxwell stepped away from the wrestling team. But after speaking with his coach, he returned and started at the 167-pound weight class for the Warriors.\nAfter returning to the team, Biringer made Foxwell a team captain because of Foxwell's work ethic and focus.\n\"The other wrestlers looked up to him,\" Biringer said. \"He has such a good, gentle demeanor that he was just very well liked.\"\n\"He just had one of those infectious smiles that you're like, 'It's always good to see Darren,'\" Biringer added.\nFamily said on Thursday that arrangements for funeral services and a celebration of life are being made and will be announced soon. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We also love getting to introduce new people to the hobby at such a high-profile event,\" Ruth said.\nWith what is essentially the equivalent of a single lightbulb and no permanent infrastructure, ham radio operators can talk to people around the world.\n\"It's definitely important to have that as a backup and maintain that knowledge of how to use it, \" Ruth said.\nThe public event helps serve as validation to the numerous ham radio volunteers who spend countless hours providing emergency communications, public service work and other benefits throughout the community and region, Ruth said.\nThis year's event was also notable as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted a more active hurricane season than normal and saw the first named storm of the season already, he said.\nWhile incredibly important and useful, smartphone technology is often taken for granted and relies on a multi billion dollar infrastructure that, whether storms or computer glitches, doesn't take a lot to knock down, he said.\nRadios are more than just an old fashioned means of communication, according to Ruth, with new technologies and capabilities always being added that can function on older equipment.\n\"It doesn't always have to be the latest and greatest equipment,\" he said.\nThe club recently introduced a program called WinLink Global Radio Email that, by connecting to pathways, essentially allows emails to be sent through ham radio, he said.\nThe area in Tuckahoe the field day event operated in was essentially a cell phone dead zone and a highlight of the event is showcasing to visiting groups including Scouts how the radios can connect with other operators across the country.\n\"Their eyes light up,\" Ruth said.\nThe Radio Club is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the promotion of amateur radio and service to the community and provides communications support to other local non-profit groups during public events.\nFurther supporting emergency preparedness education, the group also recently donated handheld Family Radio Service radios and tabletop weather radios to Homeland Security classes at Kent Island High School and Queen Anne's County High School, as well as sponsoring an Enrichment, Extension and Intervention class at Stevensville Middle School.\nThese classes are part of a broader initiative offering the Community Emergency Response Team program to students, in partnership with Queen Anne's County Department of Emergency Services.\nThe donated radios will be used to help provide hand-on experience for students to become familiar with radio communications, a vital component of public safety and emergency response training, Ruth said.\nDonations were made possible through a grant by the Amateur Radio Relay League Foundation to promote knowledge and interest in ham radio among youths.\nHappy to welcome anyone curious about ham radios, the Queen Anne's Amateur Radio Club meets monthly and regularly provides demonstrations at community events including all weeklong at the upcoming Queen Anne's County Fair.\nMore information can be found by contacting qso@qaarc.org or visiting qaarc.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Sheriff's Office said the drive was born out of a partnership between the schools and the law enforcement agency.\n\"We have a very good, close working relationship with the Caroline County Public School System,\" Sheriff Donald Baker said. \"We have deputies on all the campuses, so we try to absolutely foster good relationships with the kids because I believe that positive relationships turn out to be positive outcomes.\"\nDuring last year's drive, the Sheriff's Office collected 55 backpacks full of school supplies and delivered them to Caroline County Public Schools' office.\nAlong with fostering good relationships, Baker said he hopes the supply drive will help Caroline County children succeed even more in the classroom.\n\"We try to help out as much as we can to make sure that our children in Caroline County and in Caroline County Public Schools succeed, and however we can help them succeed, we're always going to be there for them,\" Baker said.\nThe Sheriff's Office is requesting new and unused school supplies for the drive. Drop off locations are at The Caroline County Sheriff's Office headquarters, the Ridgely Town Office, the Preston Town Office and the Federalsburg Police Department during business hours. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This year's training brought Talbot and Caroline sheriff's deputies, Easton police, local EMTs and paramedics, and others to The Country School.\nCaroline County Cpl. Kenny Tull led a drill Thursday afternoon, showing me just how critical it is that first responders from different counties to work together cohesively under stress.\nAnd the results were enlightening: officers and EMTs didn't always make the correct decision every split-second, but they did confer with each other on what steps to take during the next drill, learning how to get better along the way.\nTo learn more about the training, read my story below.

    "content": "Seconds count: The Country School hosts active shooter training for law enforcement, EMS\n\n July 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 591\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 With schools starting back up next month, police and first responders gathered at The Country School in Easton on Thursday to partake in active shooter training.Four separate drills took place Thursday. Officers entered the school to take down a mock shooter. They joined with paramedics and EMTs to locate mock students in classrooms, assess their injuries and evacuate them from the building in a safe manner.\nResponders often communicated with one another on how to follow the proper incident command tactics, at times acknowledging the improvements they could make to their decisions during the drill. Caroline County Cpl. Kenny Tull said the drills will help improve all aspects of emergency response if a school shooting occurs on the Mid-Shore.\n\"It's a learning experience for everyone,\" Tull said.\nIn previous years, active shooter training took place at schools in Talbot and Caroline counties.\nRecently, the drills have included a team of both law enforcement and EMS personnel called the Rescue Task Force. Once a hallway or area is cleared, officers will protect unarmed EMTs and paramedics in \"warm zones,\" where danger may still exist even if the main threat is eliminated.\nThat practice is life-saving in a real situation, Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said.\n\"Before, (EMS personnel) didn't go in until the building got cleared, which caused more deaths,\" he said. \"The quicker we can get treatment for people, the quicker we can get paramedics in there with us, the more people that hopefully will survive.\"\nStill, the top priority is eliminating the shooter or main threat.\n\"The initial driving force is stop the killing, because the statistics will show you that an assailant can kill more people than you can treat,\" Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey said.\n\"Their driving force is stop the dying,\" Lowrey said of EMTs and paramedics. \"You toggle between those two driving forces.\"\nGamble said first responders have taken FEMA-required incident command training, which serves as a common baseline for members of different agencies.\n\"A lot of this stuff spawned out of 9/11, getting fire, police, paramedics everybody on the same page. Square up communications,\" Gamble said.\nHaving so many agencies on hand Thursday was an opportunity for first responders to acclimate with one another and become more comfortable working together during an emergency response, agency leaders said.\nCaroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker emphasized that local agencies already share a solid rapport.\n\"You'd be surprised how much there is interaction between counties and agencies,\" Baker said.\nPlus, the geography of Mid-Shore counties sometimes means Caroline County police may be first on the scene to a Talbot County emergency, or vice versa.\n\"For something that happens at Preston Elementary, Talbot County will be the first ones there,\" Talbot County Maj. Steve Elliott said. \"If something happens at Chapel Elementary, Caroline County will be the first ones there.\"\nTina Kintop, EMS division chief for the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services, said it's most important for EMTs and paramedics to be disciplined and properly trained to participate in the rescue task force with police.\nOn Thursday, the drills didn't stop when the mock shooter went down. First responders secured students, assessed the severity of their injuries and evacuated them from the building. The job doesn't end there, Kintop said.\nPolice and EMS focus on locating a site for reunification of families. Gamble said different schools already have plans in place for reunification spots, some of which have been used for fire drills or bomb threats in the past.\nBy practicing these processes Thursday, agencies worked to create a streamlined plan they hope they will never have to use.\n\"It's all about organization and accountability,\" Kintop said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Sheriff warns of rising scams targeting local businesses, residents\n\n August 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Headlines \n \n 510\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE \u2014 The Queen Anne's County Chamber of Commerce welcomed Sheriff Gary Hofmann on July 30 as part of its ongoing seminar series, where he provided an in-depth look at the latest scams affecting businesses and individuals \u2014 and the steps they can take to protect themselves.Speaking at the Kent Island Library, Hofmann emphasized the importance of awareness and vigilance in a county he described as \"very trusting and generous,\" where numerous worthwhile charities and nonprofits operate.\n\"Benefactors should always verify the legitimacy of an organization before donating,\" he said.\nHofmann outlined how small businesses, which often lack training and robust IT resources, are frequently targeted. Scammers may use stolen credit cards to place large orders, leaving businesses unaware until it is too late. To reduce risk, Hofmann recommended printing invoices and verifying identification when fulfilling pickup orders.\nHe also warned of phishing emails and fake invoices that can appear legitimate but include malicious links or fraudulent payment requests.\n\"If you find something out of the ordinary or that looks suspicious, take a breath,\" Hofmann said. \"Scammers often use fear or urgency tactics \u2014 like threatening to cut off power \u2014 to compel quick action. It's important to slow down.\"\nOne common scam involves demands for payment via prepaid gift cards. In other cases, scammers impersonate tech support, offering to fix nonexisting issues in exchange for access to personal data.\nHofmann said data harvesting can occur almost anywhere. Fake job postings often request personal information or payment for background checks. \"Check washing\" is also on the rise \u2014 criminals steal checks from mailboxes and alter them to commit fraud. Hofmann advised residents to walk checks directly into the post office to minimize risk.\n\"Using secure payment methods and monitoring accounts regularly is key,\" he said. \"Set up alerts for check clearances and large withdrawals, and implement internal controls like requiring two signatures.\"\nWhen writing checks, Hofmann recommended pressing firmly into the paper to make alterations more difficult. He also urged residents to shred sensitive documents before disposal to avoid \"dumpster identity theft.\"\n\"We don't think about how much information we're putting out there when we throw things away,\" he said.\nWith the rise of contactless payments, Hofmann encouraged people to cover the front of their credit cards at checkout to prevent nearby cameras from capturing card numbers. He also warned about credit card skimmers \u2014 devices that mimic real readers and can steal information from magnetic strips using hidden cameras or overlays.\nOther scams include:\nOverpayment scams, where fraudsters send more than the owed amount and request a refund before the original check bounces.Malicious QR codes that direct users to phishing sites or install malware.Tax scammers impersonating government agencies.Ransomware attacks that encrypt a victim's data until payment is made.\nHofmann stressed that education and prevention are the best tools to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated criminals. Staff training, multi-factor authentication, and careful scrutiny of digital communications are essential.\n\"Taking the extra time to assess and validate links is imperative,\" he said. \"Multi-factor authentication might be inconvenient, but it can save you a lot of headaches down the line.\"\nHe also encouraged reporting suspicious activity. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Before it was over, Phillips said several deputies and school staff were assaulted, and one staff member was taken to the hospital. Phillips did not disclose the extent of their injuries, but he said that everyone was going to be OK.\nThe school safety monitor received multiple blows to the head and was held down on the floor, and three deputies were spat on by students, Phillips said.\n\"That's a biological thing, you just don't know what you're dealing with, now they have to get tests done,\" Phillips said.\nPhillips said the incident was prompted by something that happened outside of school. He did not provide further details on what incited the fighting.\nThe response from law enforcement was substantial, including 10 Cambridge police officers, seven sheriff's deputies and five state troopers.\n\"A majority of law enforcement in our small geographical area was at C-SD,\" Phillips said.\nPublic details are limited due to the involvement of juveniles, but a 15-year-old was arrested and charged with five counts of second-degree assault, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, failure to obey a lawful order, disturbing the peace, disrupting school activities, obstructing and hindering, and affray, according to the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office press release.\nThe second student arrested was 14 years old. The student was charged with one count of second-degree assault, disorderly conduct, failure to obey a reasonable and lawful order, disturbing the peace, disrupting school operations, obstructing and hindering, and affray, according to the press release.\n\"The crowd was actually larger than that (the two arrests). A lot of onlookers with their cameras and stuff,\" Phillips said.\nThe two juveniles were taken to the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office, then released to their guardians with referrals made to the Department of Juvenile Services, according to the press release.\nThis report may be updated. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Woman charged for graffiti acts at Sts. Peter and Paul Elementary\n\n September 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 A woman is being held at the Talbot County Detention Center after being accused of spray-painting graffiti around town, including at Sts. Peter and Paul Elementary School.Sian Radaskiewicz-King, 32, was arrested Friday by Easton police on charges of malicious destruction of property and use of a hate symbol. She was later charged with defacing religious property and disturbing school operations, among other counts.\nAccording to court documents, King allegedly spray-painted the transgender symbol on dumpsters, the sidewalk and a step outside the Catholic school off of Route 50. Other spray-painted symbols were found on a fence at the Hampton Inn next to the school, per court records.\nThe symbols were found elsewhere in town, including outside East End Liquors, The Market at Dover Station and other businesses. The transgender symbol, often used to encourage gender inclusivity, is a combination of the male and female signs.\nAt an unusually crowded bail hearing on Monday afternoon, Talbot County District Court Judge Karen Ketterman ordered King to be held without bond in the Detention Center. A trial is scheduled for Oct. 28.\nMany parents and school officials from Sts. Peter and Paul filled the courtroom. School Board Chair Peggy Wilson asked Ketterman to not approve King's release. Wilson cited the Aug. 27 shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, which killed two children and injured 18 people, as a reason why the school community is concerned for the safety of students.\n\"Our fear is not the symbol itself, but the possibility of a copycat situation,\" Wilson said.\nKing, according to public legal representation, is transgender. She previously attended Sts. Peter and Paul School.\nThe Minneapolis shooter, Robin Westman, was referred to as transgender by federal officials. Westman's gender identity wasn't clear, according to The Associated Press.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook said in a statement this weekend that the graffiti incidents are \"especially painful\" given the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting.\n\"It reminds us of the responsibility we all share to ensure our children's safety and well-being,\" Cook wrote. \"We condemn such acts of intimidation, they have no place in our community.\"\nIn a statement Sunday, the Delmarva Pride Center condemned the graffiti acts as a \"misuse\" of the international transgender symbol.\n\"We are deeply troubled that an LGBTQIA+ symbol was misused in a way that could be construed as hateful,\" the statement read. \"Symbols such as the Transgender Symbol exist to affirm identity, celebrate diversity, and foster belonging \u2014 not to spread fear or division.\n\"This incident occurs at a time when Transgender people continue to face targeted attacks in society. We call on our neighbors, allies, and community members to stand together, to reject hate in all its forms, and to embrace the values of acceptance, compassion, and love.\"\nOn Monday, Easton Police Deputy Chief Greg Wright said the agency will increase patrol this week at Sts. Peter and Paul School and other schools in town. He said police \"have no reason to believe that there was any attempt or desire to harm anyone.\"\nBOND DECISION\nBridgette Lane, an assistant at the Talbot County public defender's office, argued in court on Monday that King should be granted release based on the low severity of charges, an otherwise clean criminal record and the Detention Center's recommendation.\nLane said King has \"expressed remorse\" and understands \"she can't be acting out in these ways.\"\nKing, who is listed as having a Baltimore address, was recently staying in Easton with her mother, Lane said. If released, the expectation was for King to stay with her mother.\nTalbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said the graffiti incident is concerning due to the context of the Minneapolis shooting last month, as well as the fact that King's mother's house is close to the school.\n\"Here we have this clear warning sign,\" Coale said. \" ... We don't know if the defendant is capable of carrying out something worse. But the state doesn't want to find out.\"\nKetterman said both sides made good points, but she hammered home that there are \"no conditions of release\" that would ensure the safety of the community. The judge said she's concerned about the location of the graffiti and King's documented mental health diagnoses, which include bipolar disorder and PTSD.\n\"I don't think the court has another choice,\" Ketterman said after ruling no bond and ordering the defendant complete a mental health evaluation.\nInformation from The Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For example, there are very few high rises in Kent County.That works both ways though.\nCity firefighters do not typically have to go into grain or corn silos for rescues. But Kent County firefighters may have to.\nAnd they have the equipment to do it. They are called grain rescue devices and because of a grant, Kennedyville Volunteer Fire Department now has one in addition to the devices already at fire departments in Millington and Rock Hall.\n\"Kent County, Maryland, is noted for a few things,\" retired firefighter Larry Slagle said, speaking for the Chestertown Volunteer Fire Company.\n\"Among those, is our agricultural interests. We have any number of farmers whose primary interest is growing and processing grain products,\" he said. \"And for efficiency, these farmers maintain grain bins, aka silos, on their farms.\"\nSlagle said that occasionally, especially during grain harvest season, personnel may have to enter the silo, perhaps to clear a blockage or discern what the problem may be.\n\"This is one of the most dangerous things they will ever do,\" he added.\nSlagle's post indicated that that the suction of the grain material as it's being unloaded at the bottom, is as dangerous as the riptide or undertow at the ocean.\n\"Across the United States and even the entire world, many farm workers have entered this environmen \u2026 and lost their lives.\"\nFire official experts concur with Slagle and Chestertown fire company, saying that about 55 grain bin entrapment events happen around the United States, many in Midwest states. Farmers and workers can get caught in equipment, submerged in grain or experience a medical event while working.\nThat is why the training with the equipment was instrumental for local firefighters.\nOn July 21, Slagle reported that fire companies from Chestertown, Galena, Betterton, Chestertown, Millington, Rock Hall and Marydel attended a regional training program, hosted by the Kennedyville Volunteer Fire Company with the topic: \"Grain bin emergencies and how to safely mitigate them.\"\nClasses were conducted by members of the National Education Center for Agricultural Safety.\nSlagle said, \"This training is especially invaluable to us, as sometimes emergency responders are sometimes the victims themselves.\"\nAfter a period of classroom discussion, the activity transitioned outside to the training trailer.\nThrough specialized engineering, a grain bin was fashioned, and the \"suction\" phenomenon duplicated, in a safe manner, he pointed out.\nFormer member of the Kennedyville firefighter, farmer and owner of Philips Trucking, Josh Philips said that the equipment is a series of 6-8 aluminum panels, interconnected tubes with an auger, a spiral tool used to drill.\nDuring the training, the tube was placed around the mock accident victim and the auger extracted the grain that was simulating suffocating them.\nFirst responders practiced methods like ropes; confined space operations; patient care and packaging.\n\"At any time during the exercise, should something with the training go sideways, instructors could terminate the process and drain away the grain product,\" Slagle pointed out.\nEverything was conducted safely and first responders left with a sense of confidence in the training, he added.\nKennedyville Assistant Chief Mark Dixon thanked Philips who had nominated Kennedyville for the grant to make the equipment possible.\nSlagle said, \"In the fire service, we have a mantra. 'It is not acceptable for anyone to be injured, or even die, because of training. It's the purpose of training to prevent that very serious, even tragic outcome \u2026 during a real emergency.'\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Sheriff: Youth justice laws add to crime\n\n September 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Crime \n \n 539\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 In the past week, there have been three juvenile arrests related to violent crimes in the City of Cambridge.Dorchester County Sheriff Jimmy Phillips said this level of violent crime is \"not normal\" and officers feel their hands are tied by the current juvenile justice laws Phillips said lack accountability.\nOn the second day of school at Cambridge-South Dorchester High School last week, two students were arrested after assaulting the school safety monitor. Phillips described the scene as a \"melee.\"\nPhillips said three sheriff's deputies were spat on and the school safety monitor was taken to the hospital. Two boys, ages 14 and 15, were arrested following the incident.\nThe 15-year-old boy, Jaheem Mortaz Brown, was released to his step-father's custody. Three days later, the Brown allegedly shot his step-father in the face. The extent of the step-father's injuries has not been disclosed.\nIn addition, Phillips said Cambridge police received a call this weekend that juveniles around 11 years old were shoplifting from the Wawa on Sunburst Highway.\n\"They're shoplifting because they know they (the juvenile system) can't do nothing with them,\" Phillips said.\nPhillips said the problem of juvenile crime will continue until the \"broken juvenile justice system\" is changed.\n\"The juvenile justice system in the state of Maryland is broken; it's not working,\" he said. \"We're not holding anybody accountable.\"\nThe former Secretary of the Department of Juvenile Services, Vincent Schiraldi received intense backlash from Mid-Shore sheriffs, including Phillips. The Maryland Sheriffs Association sent a letter to Gov. Wes Moore calling for Schiraldi's immediate resignation last year. Schiraldi stepped down from the position in June.\n\"Consistently in Maryland, juveniles have been charged with serious violent crimes,\" the letter states, \"only to be turned right back over to a parent or guardian, and back out on the streets to commit more crimes.\"\nAfter an in-person community meeting with the secretary around two years ago, Phillips said \"He had the audacity to tell us, 'The data that I'm receiving doesn't support your claim of increased juvenile crime,'\" Phillips recalled. \"And our reply to that was, 'Well, obviously the numbers are going to go down because you're not allowing us to charge (them) anymore.'\"\nIn 2022, the Maryland General Assembly passed a juvenile justice reform bill stressing rehabilitation rather than punishment in addressing juvenile behavioral issues, according to its proponents. The reform took effect in 2024.\nIn August, the Cambridge Police Department presented its quarterly report, which revealed that overall crime decreased, but there were concerns regarding homicides, robberies and juvenile violence.\nHomicides, assaults, larceny and motor vehicle theft all increased from the second quarter in 2024. The homicide rate rose 200%, with two homicides that both led to arrests. One of those homicides was committed by a juvenile.\nPhillips said this level of violent crime in Cambridge is not normal.\n\"I mean, it's not normal anywhere, but I think the biggest contributing factor we had last week is the failure of our juvenile system,\" he said.\nLast school year, students in Dorchester County saw 1,682 long- and short-term suspensions with 1,232 of those suspensions related to violence, according to Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson.\nIn an attempt to curb suspensions, Dorchester County Public Schools launched a violence prevention initiative course for students, teachers, parents and staff to ensure there is community participation. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The sprinkler system activated, limiting fire damage to the room where it started.\nAccording to the Office of the Maryland State Fire Marshal, the fire originated in a rear first-floor office. The preliminary cause was deemed accidental, the result of \"an unspecified electrical event of a power surge protector.\"\nThe fire marshal estimated about $30,000 in structure and content damages. No injuries were reported.\nA total of 36 firefighters responded, with Goodwill Volunteer Fire Company the primary agency in charge. The fire was brought under control in about 30 minutes, the fire marshal said.\nThe fire alarm company contacted 911, and the school custodian also discovered the fire after the alarm activation.\nWater collected in a back hallway, one special education classroom, an office and a conference room as the sprinkler system ran for about 20 minutes, Kibler said.\nThird-party contractors were brought in to evaluate and assist. Normal operations resumed Sept. 11, after the school was closed to students and non-essential personnel Wednesday to allow cleanup and assessment. Other Queen Anne's County Public Schools were not affected.\nQACPS expressed gratitude to first responders, the Queen Anne's County Fire Marshal's Office, the Maryland State Deputy Fire Marshal, and its custodial and maintenance staff for their work in returning the building to use.\nOn its Facebook page, QACPS wrote: \"We are thankful that there were no injuries, and our fire suppression system worked appropriately.\"\nQuestions should be directed to Principal Lou Sheppard, Kibler said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat.

    "content": "A visit to a foreign country - the past\n\n September 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George F. Will | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 745\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - This nation is awash with heated and ungenerous judgments about its past and about Americans who lived before we ascended to today's sunny uplands of enlightenment.So, for your final summer read, try something tonally different: Drew Gilpin Faust's memoir \"Necessary Trouble: Growing Up at Midcentury.\" It concerns not her presidency of Harvard from 2007 to 2018 but her coming of age in the 1950s and 1960s.She was a high-octane student activist, involved in dangerous civil rights campaigning in the Deep South before becoming hyper-active in agitating against U.S. involvement in Vietnam.She is, however, an accomplished historian, and her book is most interesting, and needed, as a mellow, humane acceptance of an enduring truth from a forgotten novel (by L.P. Hartley): \"The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.\" Faust has gone back to a foreign country - America when post-1945 conventions and complacencies began to crumble - and has returned with a needed gift for today's nation: an example of mature assessment.Faust was born into a prosperous family in the caste system of segregated Virginia, a society thick with \"rules and roles\" governing - actually, suffocating - young white women and all Black people. They were entrapped, in not altogether dissimilar ways, in the viscosity of a society defined by strict racial and gender expectations that were unarticulated because they were unquestioned.Six decades ago, two braided emancipations began, the emancipation of women, and of Blacks nearly a century after the Emancipation Proclamation.Faust's family rode to hounds and sent children north to tony prep schools and universities. But from an early age, Faust was intelligent, opinionated, inexhaustibly curious, a voracious reader - and disconcerting to her determinedly conventional mother.A high school counselor would write of \"Mrs. Gilpin's bewilderment in connection with Drewdie's intellectual gifts.\" Drew's mother \"is like a hen that has hatched a duckling and cannot understand having a daughter who is not going to be a 'Southern belle.'\" Faust would not be - as that era expressed its aspiration - \"well-adjusted.\" Least of all adjusted to a society in which the chivalric protection of women was, Faust writes, \"inextricably tied to concessions of frailty and incapacity.\" Young Drew was immersed \"in a man's world and a white world.\" She sensed the connection and set about causing what John Lewis, the civil rights leader and congressman, called \"necessary trouble.\" In the decade when Black author Ralph Ellison published his great novel \"Invisible Man\" (1952), Life magazine reflected national perceptions and assumptions.\"With the exception of a butler serving a drink on a silver tray,\" everyone pictured in Life's 1950s advertisements was White, and working women - other than in Hollywood - also were mostly invisible.Faust relished rock music, which was saturated with sexuality - Pat Boone and Frankie Avalon elbowed aside by Elvis and Little Richard - but books were most catalyzing.The 36 volumes published before 1960 about an independent and resourceful 16-year-old, Nancy Drew, were formative also for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Nancy Pelosi, Sandra Day O'Connor and others.Faust \"had never, at least as far as I knew, met a Jewish person\" when she met, through a diary, an adolescent who was \"an avid reader and aspiring writer,\" Anne Frank.Scout, the 8-year-old daughter of Atticus Finch in \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" exemplified for Faust children \"seeing clearly.\" Faust writes, \"These girls who dared - Nancy, Anne, Scout - were daring me.\" So, she went to Mississippi in 1964 for Freedom Summer, to Selma and Birmingham in 1965, this daughter whose father's car once had a hood ornament of Robert E. Lee mounted on Traveller.Faust, an academic who perhaps has not spent enough time around people who disagree with her about important matters, is uncharacteristically intemperate when she denigrates Vice President Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic 1968 presidential nominee, as a \"toady\" because he did not \"speak out\" against the war.Faust was 10 months old when Humphrey, the 37-year-old mayor of Minneapolis, successfully provoked the Democrats' 1948 national convention to put a civil rights plank in the party's platform.By challenging the upholders of Jim Crow - Southern Democratic governors and legislators - Humphrey ignited necessary trouble, which Faust would later join.Faust usually judges the past without rancor, contempt or preening, giving empathetic depictions of social contexts inherited by the people who inhabited them.When, generations hence, historians judge how we inhabited our context, they will be depicting the foreign country to which we then will be confined: the past.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nDrew Faust clasps hands with a graduate as she walks in the procession at Harvard's commencement ceremony in 2013 where she was university president. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Vicki Wilson, secretary of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society, introduced Bernier.\"Celeste is the Professor and Chair of United States and Atlantic Studies at University Edinburgh in Scotland,\" Wilson said. \"She is an author and world-renowned historian.\"Anna Murray was born free in Denton.Early in her relationship with Frederick Douglass, who was enslaved when Anna was free, she gave him all of her savings to run away to his freedom. He refused.When she told him she loved him and that he could return the money later, he finally agreed. He escaped and eventually returned the money. They got married in New York City in 1838.\"She lived her life by the conviction that her home was the council chamber of the free,\" said Bernier. Anna, working as an agent of the Underground Railroad, fed hundreds of people, day or night.She worked with Harriet Tubman on the Eastern Shore, said Bernier.In his writings, Frederick Douglass relates a story about a woman from Easton, who came to them for help.\"This poor woman's back and shoulders had been literally hacked to pieces,\" he said. \"Three months ago, her cheek was branded with burning irons. We sat with her, and all she said was 'I want to get to Canada.'\" Bernier, working from original source documents, delivered a lecture on Murray-Douglass with descriptions like, \"freedom fighter,\" \"revolutionary liberator\" and \"human rights philosopher.\"Anna did not just sit in her kitchen baking biscuits.According to Bernier, Anna was an expert cook and could whip up everything from dishes from the African diaspora to European styles of cuisine. There were a lot of hungry people to feed, and at times she had to ask her own family to sacrifice food and a warm bed for someone else.She was interested in how fashion could reflect a person's wholeness. She designed a silk plum colored wedding dress for herself in 1830 in New York City. Anna worked tirelessly to help newly emancipated slaves by feeding them and giving them dignified clothes.Anna knew the power of printing and publishing her own story. This control of her own representation was crucial. Her descendants knew this too and wrote to make the abolitionist cause manifest.Bernier called Anna an \"egalitarian human rights philosopher.\" And she raised her five children to carry on this fight against white supremacy.\"They took that intergenerational pain, that intergenerational trauma, that inter-generations suffering, and they turned it into intergenerational liberation, intergenerational activism and a blueprint for what a world based on equal human rights would actually look like,\" Bernier said.Bernier said it is hard to estimate how many slaves Anna set free. One estimate is 1,200, but Bernier wonders if it is much higher.The historian painted a picture of Anna as Frederick's equal and protector.She said Frederick had a way with words, and Anna had a way with numbers.Anna was always on the move to avoid persecution and to keep her husband safe, but the cause of liberty echoed loudly in the Douglass' homes. Their final home was on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. They bought it with her money.When Anna dies in 1882, 3,000 people attended her funeral.After Bernier's lecture, there was time for questions and mingling with coffee.The historian signed copies of her book \"If I Survive,\" which was also authored by Andrew Taylor.Bernier opened her laptop to share images of the Douglass family with some of the abolitionists' living relatives, who came to the lecture.One descendent, Thelma Nichols of Denton, is a spry 97. She shared stories that her father had told her.\"It is exciting to know that I am a relative of someone as important as Anna,\" said Deborah Murray-Dates of Cambridge, Anna's greatniece.\"Incredible.\"The Douglasses had five children.

    "content": "King's granddaughter carrying forward his legacy\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JESSICA A. JOHNSON | Section: Columns \n \n 673\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I happened to catch the recent \"CBS Mornings\" news interview of Yolanda Renee King, the only grandchild of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. While promoting her new children's book honoring her grandparents titled \"We Dream a World,\" Yolanda gave a profound answer when asked what she would say to them if they were alive today. \"I think I would first start off with an apology,\" she said, which was surprising to CBS host Nate Burleson, who immediately asked the young activist what she meant by her response. Yolanda continued, \"An apology to where we are right now, as a nation and really as a world.\"Yolanda is only 15 years old, and it is evident that she has a deep understanding of what her grandparents fought for as leaders of the civil rights movement. In August of last year, during the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, Yolanda boldly declared that her generation would \"be defined by action, not apathy.\"\nAs Yolanda is growing up before our eyes, she has the youthful exuberance of her grandfather's resolve and displays the dignified grace of her grandmother. Yolanda saying she would apologize to her grandparents for our nation not yet reaching the potential they believed in should make us thoughtfully reflect on how Dr. King also warned about becoming apathetic.\nApathy is a brutal paralyzer of life. It can cause us to be ensnared in a dangerous mode of stagnation emotionally, spiritually, and sometimes physically. Apathy also triggers entitled disinterest in our society. In 2021, Tom Nichols, an instructor at Harvard Extension School and the U.S. Naval War College, asserted in an interview with The Harvard Gazette that \"narcissism and nihilism\" are the primary threats to our country's democracy and societal relationships. Elaborating on the latter, Nichols said that many people ask why our society is \"so mean and heartless and awful,\" but many of them do not contribute anything to make their communities better, or they will vote against policies that affect their well-being due to \"narcissistic beefs.\"\n\"We have become surly villagers,\" Nichols maintained, \"me, my family, my little plot of land, and everybody else can go to hell.\" This type of sullen attitude is what Yolanda is urging our country to overcome as she is an emerging voice on critical issues such as gun violence and homelessness.\nAs Yolanda continues to attentively study the Godly principles that enabled her grandfather to be that drum major for justice who changed the course of our nation, I am reminded of two of his sermons where he encouraged his followers to live with purpose and passion and to shower others with Christian love.\nThe first sermon is titled \"But If Not,\" a 1967 message that King delivered at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church. King expresses that the \"ultimate test\" of our faith is when we get to a \"but if not\" moment in life, a moment where we have to travel along an arduous journey with no other option but to lean on God's promises.\nThis passage stands out to avoid being gripped by apathy during a spiritual test: \"... somewhere along the way [in life] you should discover something that's so dear, so precious to you, that is so eternally worthful, that you will never give it up.\" The second sermon is \"Levels of Love,\" an Ebenezer address King gave in 1962. He implored the congregation to \"rise to agape, to Christian love\" because \"[t]he greatness of it is that you love every man, not for your sake but for his sake. And you love every man because God loves him.\"\nIt is remarkable that Yolanda exemplifies the love and compassion her grandparents demonstrated as she diligently works to uplift others. She is blazing her own path, and it is truly inspiring to watch it unfold. She probably has not had a \"but if not\" moment yet in her young life thus far, but I have no doubt she is developing the character and strength to face the challenges she knows are coming. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mid-Shore native appointed to Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture\n\n January 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: News \n \n 715\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Jaelon Terrele Moaney has been appointed as a commissioner by Gov. Wes Moore to be on the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture. His term is from 2023 to 2027.According to MCAAH website, the purpose of the \"the commission is to identify and preserve buildings, communities and sites of historical and cultural importance to the African American experience in Maryland. This competitive program, offered once per year, is supported through an annual appropriation from the Maryland General Assembly and is administered as a joint partnership of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture and The Maryland Historical Trust.\"\nThey give away $5 million a year, and Moaney works with his commission to find suitable candidates who are either architecturally or culturally preserving Black history and identity.\n\"It is the first ever ethnic commission in the United States. It is something that our colleagues across the country look to as an example. I feel humble to join the group as the youngest. The commission, in general, documents, collects African American heritage across the state,\" said Moaney.\nHe covers Delmarva for the commission and currently lives in Cambridge with his wife. Moaney is a product of Talbot County Public Schools, where he played football. He went to Williams College in Massachusetts.\nMoaney said he hopes to energize the commission.\n\"I am trying to expand notions of Blackness that center on joy, that center freedom, agency and maybe push and highlight elements of our culture here on the Shore that often get overlooked. I think we have to reinforce accurate portrayals of Black life as well as ones that normalize our culture,\" he said.\nHe takes a long historical look at how Black people have suffered in America.\n\"Our country is really trying to reconcile with wounds that haven't fully healed or even the past few weeks, some that are opening up scars that are deeper than we could imagine. Like the people of Haiti, who have a large population in Salisbury now, or the people who were elected in Federalsburg for the first time in centuries \u2014 have the space to give it justice,\" he said.\nMoaney will bring the commission to Chestertown for a public meeting in April. That meeting will be in the Bethel AME Church, where the Freedom Riders came and stayed in 1962.\n\"We have regular commission meetings that will happen all over the state. It is a beauty to be at the sites we are trying to preserve. Some are trying to be restored, some have been restored, some are receiving grants,\" Moaney said.\n\"I was assigned two committees. One was African American Heritage Preservation Program. The funding for that just got raised by the assembly from $1 million to $5 million. Close to 50% of the awardees were on the Eastern Shore. It is a collaboration with the Maryland Historical Trust which is in the Department of Planning,\" he said.\nAmong the grants awarded by the commission through the Historical Preservation Program for fiscal year 2024 are:\n$250,000 for the American Legion Mannie Scott Post 193 Building in Denton.\n$138,000 to Alpha Genesis Community Development Corporation in Cambridge.\n$200,000 to Kent County Public Library.\n$250,000 to Bryan's United Methodist Church in Grasonville.\n$250,000 to the Mid-Shore Community Foundation in Royal Oak.\nThe grants will offer assistance to organizations and private citizens in their sponsorship of projects involving the acquisition, construction, or improvement of sites related to African American heritage, according to a press release from the governor's office.\nMoaney's other appointment is to the Inaugural Statewide Book Drive. \"The best part are the oral histories. There are so many discoveries. It's a privilege to be there,\" he said.\nOutside of his work on the commission, Moaney is the founder of literacy group called the Needle's Eye Academy.\n\"If you are familiar with Gil Scott-Heron. He was arguably the soundtrack to the Black power movement as a poet and a musician and an oralist. The song 'Needles Eye' is where the Academy's name emanates from. From the 1972 album 'Pieces of the Man,'\" he said.\n\"They have been asking, 'Are there any college age students who will speak to high schoolers and maybe even start a book club. We donated our old book sales into Berkshire County Public Schools (Massachusetts). In August of 2020 we started online in Talbot County Public Schools with three wonderful students.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Woodson founded what is now the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. The following year, he began publishing what is now The Journal of African American History, a publication of history, research and book reviews.\nIn 1926, Woodson founded \"Negro History Week\" to honor the history, culture and contributions of African Americans. He chose February to coincide with the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln. In 1976, President Gerald Ford extended the observation to a month, now known as Black History Month.\nWoodson believed that history was \"made by the people, not simply or primarily by great men.\"\nLocal writer, Niambi Davis had the opportunity to contribute to the Black History display at Bethel AME. The subjects, Davis said, \"are important and more than just the usual Douglass and Tubman stories; they're the unknown local, national and international folks.\"\nThe display is open to the congregation and anyone wishing to attend services. Service begins at 11 a.m. Sunday mornings.

    "content": "Lawmakers propose task force to probe long-term inequities facing Black women\n\n February 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TORRENCE BANKS Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 817\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON \u2014 The persistence of economic, educational and legal disparities in the lives of Black women and girls would be the target of a federal task force recently proposed by a group of House members.\"Simply acknowledging our country's history of targeted discrimination, harassment and violence against Black women and girls will not correct years of systemic racism and sexism,\" Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Illinois) said in a statement after the legislation creating the task force was introduced earlier this month.\n\"We must leverage the full weight of the federal government to seek justice for Black women and girls who deserve an equal opportunity for a full, happy, healthy life,\" Kelly said.\nKelly is co-chair of the Caucus on Black Women and Girls, along with Reps. Yvette Clarke of New York and Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, who also sponsored the measure. Reps. Jennifer McClellan (D-Virginia), Valerie Foushee (D-North Carolina) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pennsylvania) also have signed on to the bill, called the \"Protect Black Women and Girls Act.\"\nThe bill would establish a task force to examine several aspects of the lives of Black women and girls, including education, healthcare, economic development, housing and civil rights. The task force would look at the effectiveness of programs and policies at the state, federal and local levels and make recommendations for changes.\nKelly said that the bill would help governments be more proactive in ensuring that Black women receive equal opportunities.\nThe task force would be led by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice. Both would then share information with the United States Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR).\nThe civil rights commission also would conduct a study and collect data about the social justice, economic and health effects of discrimination and inequities on Black women and girls. The bill was originally introduced in 2021 with 15 co-sponsors. However, Congress took no action on it.\nMaryland Del. Jheanelle Wilkins, a Democrat, said the legislation would allow the state's government to look at the results from the research and craft more equitable policies.\n\"We know that signs point to black women being disproportionately impacted by many things whether it's maternal health \u2014 and in Maryland, Black women are four times as likely to die as a result of childbirth,\" said Wilkins, who also serves as the chair of the state's Legislative Black Caucus.\nIn 2021, the maternal mortality rate of non-Hispanic Black women was 69.9 births per 100,000 live births, according to the Centers for Disease Control. That was more than two times the rate for non-Hispanic white women.\n\"We are the caregivers for our community, we're the matriarchs of our home, but also of the Black community,\" said Kelli Richardson Lawson, founder of the mental health nonprofit organization The SonRise Project, based in Bethesda, Maryland. \"So we've always had to take care of everybody else before we take care of ourselves.\"\nLawson said that the passage of the legislation is crucial because of the socioeconomic challenges that Black women have faced.\nThirty-nine percent of white women earn a bachelor's or associate degree by the age of 29, compared to 21% of Black women, according to the American Association of University Women.\n\"Based on what I've seen, this bill would help mitigate some of the issues that we see involving Black women and girls in a variety of areas,\" said Lawson, whose non-profit serves as a safe space for Black parents to discuss issues involving teen mental health.\nBlack girls also face disadvantages in education. A 2020-2021 school discipline report from the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights found that \"Black girls were nearly two times more likely to receive one or more in-school suspensions, one or more out-of-school suspensions, and expulsions than White girls.\"\nIn addition, Black school-aged girls are four times more likely to be arrested in school than white girls, according to research discussed on Kelly's web page.\nJohn Berkley, coordinator for the National Pan-Hellenic Council in Maryland, Virginia and several other states, said that Maryland has many organizations working to help Black women. Knowing that Congress is backing them up with legislation would be a huge boost, he said.\n\"Now they could say that It's not only a community effort but also a national policy that we now have some teeth behind,\" Berkley said. \"And maybe with that, that will bring more awareness to what's going on with Black females in our various raised communities.\"\nBerkley said that he plans to travel with his fraternity to Annapolis in a couple of weeks to talk to his legislators to see what they're doing to help Congress move the bill along.\nLawson said the task force could lead to the creation of more programs and organizations like hers, where Black women are free to focus on themselves and have vulnerable conversations.\n\"Changing the narrative, so that we can take off that cape, we can take a deep breath and exhale, and we can start to focus on ourselves,\" Lawson said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The location where James Taylor, a 23-year-old Black man, was lynched in 1892.That soil would find its way more than 800 miles south in a powerful message to remember a bleak chapter in history.\nThat journey was followed in the documentary film \"Get on the Bus.\"\nForty-two Kent County youths and adults made the trek, traveling to Civil Rights era landmarks in Alabama and Georgia, including the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; the King Center in Atlanta, Edmund Pettus Bridge and the National Voting Rights Museum in Selma and the Equal Justice Initiative's Community Remembrance Project in Montgomery.\nDirected by Justinian Dispenza of Andover Media, the film debuted on Valentine's Day at the Decker Theatre in Washington College with almost 200 people in attendance. it was also shown the at Ocean City Film Festival earlier this month.\nAfter its debut, the powerful emotions it invoked resulted in people interested in screening it.\nFor Dispenza, it's uplifting to see his work yielding these results.\n\"That's what we're all aiming to do as filmmakers. To make a change in people's lives. It was an incredible experience,\" he said.\nAs people left the theatre, Dispenza reflected on the process of creating \"Get on the Bus\" in slight awe.\nBecause it did not start out as being a film.\nThe idea initially came from Program Director of Minary's Dream Alliance Paul Tue III and Co-Chair of the James Taylor Justice Coalition Philip Dutton, to take a trip, educating people about the past, to the roots of the Civil Rights Movement, Alabama.\nWhat started as a field trip where Dispenza was brought on to take pictures became something else.\nDispenza, no stranger to films about social issues, was eager.\nExcept there were obstacles.\nBefore they left, he was diagnosed with Lyme's Disease. Forced to take antibiotics on the road, he was told by his doctor to avoid the sun.\n\"That's kinda tough to do, July in the Deep South,\" Dispenza said, laughing.\nIt was five days in that sweltering heat with cameras rolling 24-7, no cloud in sight.\nWhile he and Lead Editor Tanner Presswood filmed, Dispenza used long sleeves like protective gear and a floppy hat to ward off the sun.\nPerhaps if he didn't feel a strong sense of purpose, he would have thought of his discomfort more than three times in the trip. But seeing through the lens of time how racism was a way of life for many, which seemed like a different universe to him, busied him in a beneficial way.\nThey went to sites like the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, where on Sunday, September 15, 1963, at 10:22 a.m., the church became known around the world when a bomb exploded, killing four young girls attending Sunday School.\nEastern Shore girls the age of those victims read that and marveled.\n\"How can someone hate someone so much that they could hurt them and have no consideration in their heart?\" Love Jackson asked.\nAs they ascended the steps to the upper part of the church they witnessed a reenactment of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.\nOvercome by the strong feelings standing where King stood, Pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Chestertown Joel Tolbert opened up.\n\"I sit in the pulpit every Sunday. But I tried to stand in that pulpit...it's a hard space,\" he acknowledged.\nThe emotions would heighten.\nJust down the road there were statues of attack dogs, replicas of what Black people faced in 1963. There was a statue of children against the wall in a firing line and statues of enslaved people in chains, heads down in despair.\nBroadcasted at the The National Memorial for Peace and Justice were some of the reasons they were lynched, horrific in their simplicity and ignorance.\nOne was lynched for not tipping his hat to the police officer.\nAnother to yield a better return in the sharecropping business.\nThere was one, where, since a man could not be found, his 2-year-old daughter was lynched in his place.\nThe group journeyed to Selma. At the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they crossed as others did in 1965, knowing that beatings, dogs and water hoses waited for them on the other side.\nFounder of Minary's Dream Alliance, Doncella Wilson, felt that weight. Crossing the same bridge that 600 Civil Rights marchers crossed, she had to stop in the middle and reflect, before walking on., head high.\nThe camera captured the moment.\nInside the Equal Justice Initiative Museum while delivering the soil as an addition to the Legacy Museum, Dispenza broke down himself.\nHe sat on the floor and cried, having taken some ownership of the atrocities committed. But through that pain and despair, the tears and sorrow, shone hope.\n\"People were not afraid to be vulnerable,\" Dispenza said. \"It led to healing.\"\nThey were receptive to the filming process too, seeing it as a tool to do good. \"It was a tough film but a beautiful film,\" Dispenza said.\nAnd the results of the film did not leave people in despair.\nOne resident leaving Decker Theatre told him the film \"had given him a peace and hope he's never had before.\"\nThroughout the film there were positive messages to the youth. Wilson told a group of children the activists they have read about and heard were no older than they were. Tue told the youths they don't know how powerful they are.\nDispenza's film echoed with its audience as well. After the debut, it has been featured at the Bill Johnson Film Festival in Indiana.\nTue, who was with them through the entire trip, was amazed at how the footage was compiled altogether.\nHe told Dispenza, \"My God, this is going places!\"\nWith eight or nine screenings already having taken place, he was certainly not wrong.\nDispenza sees this as an urgent message to spread. \"This conversation needs to be had as school districts try to suppress Critical Race Theory,\" he said.\nIt is a topic debated among educational groups. Dispenza is more than happy to pursue these challenges and encouraged those who have great story ideas to reach out to him at Andover Media.\nFor more of his projects, visit his Imdb page at imdb.com/name/nm14340956/ as well. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The state's attorney's office released the information Friday afternoon.According to charging documents filed by the Maryland State Police, the students displayed swastikas, made Nazi salutes and directed offensive comments to a classmate because of the classmate's religious beliefs.\nThe state's attorney's office press release stated the behavior began last December and \"continued over several months despite repeated requests to stop.\"\nThe matter was reported to the state police, who investigated and filed the charges against the juveniles. The press release does not report the names or genders of the charged students.\nThe charges will be forwarded to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services for appropriate action. That entity has the discretion to refer the charges to the Calvert County Circuit Court for a hearing. The state's attorney's office then would be required to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\"Calvert County Public Schools is committed to providing students and staff with an environment that is safe, welcoming and free from all forms of discrimination,\" Susan Johnson, chief academic officer and spokesperson for the school system, said in a statement released Monday. \"The civil rights of all individuals will be protected. All complaints are investigated promptly. Upon completion of an investigation, students and school personnel may be subject to disciplinary action or consequences for discriminatory behaviors.\"\nCalvert County State's Attorney Robert Harvey (R) issued a statement last Friday.\n\"Maryland was founded on the principle of religious toleration,\" Harvey said in the statement. \"It is frankly astonishing that nearly 400 years later some people continue to persecute others based upon their religion. I call upon parents, educators and community and faith leaders to make sure that our children know that religious persecution has no place in our society.\"\nOn Tuesday, Commissioner President Earl F. \"Buddy\" Hance (R) stated, \"We will not tolerate hate speech. That's not who we are. I hope they [juveniles] get the counseling that they need.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We had a lot of older generations that had a lot of knowledge of what happened and it was never told to the kids, so the kids never knew what was going on.\"\nThe event also included exhibits featuring historical and cultural institutions, authors, quilts and poetry.\n\"They're amazing. They're just so detailed,\" St. Mary's College North Campus Area Coordinator Meghan Pushee said as she gazed at story quilts. \"I love the collage aspect and the multi-media aspect. I'm in awe of them.\"\nLater, speakers took to the stage at the Nancy R. & Norton T. Dodge Performing Arts Center on campus.\n\"Now, more than ever we must expand this history in your voice, from your memory, from your attics, from your archives,\" Southern Maryland Equity in History Coalition Hugh Davies said. \"Let us commit to doing so to bring this history forward.\"\nThe event was dedicated to longtime Calvert County NAACP officer Malcolm Funn, who died in 2022.\n\"It has been said that before we can travel forward or even truly understand why we're here today, one must understand the past,\" Piscataway Conoy Tribe Tribal Chairman Francis Gray said. \"History is our willingness to connect the past to the present. It provides us with a sense of purpose, of who we are, a sense of being \u2026 and it's here that we all have the opportunity to obtain that knowledge. The Piscataway Conoy people are excited to have this opportunity to unearth the narrative of Maryland's history.\"\nSt. Mary's College Community Affairs Liaison Kelsey R. Bush read the land acknowledgement and pledge, while Southern Maryland Equity in History Coalition Steering Committee member Janice Walthour read her poem, \"Ancestors.\"\n\"My mother used to tell my sister and me, 'Actions speak louder than words.' She would also say, 'Beauty is as beauty does,' and today is beautiful,\" said author, performer, GU272+ descendent and keynote speaker M\u00e9lisande Short-Colomb. \"More information and more stories about Native American history and African American history will be unveiled. The ancestry and history of all \u2026 will be accessible to all. Our ancestors would be proud.\"\n\"Since all stories start at the beginning, we have started by working directly with the Piscataway people to see if this was a story they would trust to be told,\" Southern Maryland National Heritage Area Executive Director Lucille Walker said. \"That's why this particular initiative is so critical. Because why are we telling any stories if we're not telling the whole story? If we're not doing it for the next generation then what are we doing?\"\nThe coalition, which is administered by \"Big Conversation: Partners in Dismantling Racism and Privilege in Southern Maryland,\" which was started at Middleham and St. Peter's Episcopal Parish in Lusby, and is supported by public school systems, libraries, museums, colleges and churches.\nSt. Mary's College President Tuajuanda Jordan said the coalition \"is a testament to the realization that we have work to do to create and sustain an inclusive community free of racism and prejudice.\"\nFor more information or to see the new website, go to www.equityinhistory.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Eighteen volleys of musket fire.\nThe men fought for the Union. They fought for freedom. Their freedom.\nThe 18 were Black Union soldiers who fought in the Civil War. They are buried in the cemetery behind St. Stephens AME Church in Unionville, the town named to honor their fight for freedom.\n\"Hearing the names is the best part,\" Pamela Roberts Price said. She has relatives in the graveyard.\nAround 70 people gathered at St. Stephens on a recent Sunday. There was a contingent of Union-garbed men with rifles, flags and shiny brass buckles.\nThe sounds of \"Amazing Grace\" drifted over gravestones that are worn by thousands of rainy days. A solo violin played \"Taps.\"\nSt. Stephens Pastor Eddie Scott opened the ceremony with a prayer. \"Comfort us in knowing that these soldiers that we stand on their shoulders, that we can have life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"\nHarriette Lowery has more than 10 relatives in the cemetery.\n\"I am related to one of the soldiers, definitely,\" she said. \"Benjamin Demby is my great-great-grandfather. My grandfather's mother was Agnes Demby Green. That was Benjamin's mother.\"\nLike Price, Lowery loves hearing the names.\n\"Every time I hear the names it gives me such pride,\" she said. \"Thinking about the chaos that is happening in our community or somewhere else, thinking about what they did, what they went through really touches me.\"\nShe noted that there were no promises to these soldiers.\n\"They did it hoping they would be free,\" Lowery said. \"They hoped they would get emancipation.\"\nShe noted some of the local Black soldiers traveled as far as Texas, and some of them had to walk from Texas to get home.\n\"I want the history to be told over and over again because not only do our young people, all races of young people, need to know what they went through,\" Lowery said. \"They sacrificed for us to do better. So don't give up on education and things like that. They need to know what people sacrificed.\"\nDan Cowgill of Middletown was master of ceremonies for the event. His ancestors were Quakers who donated the land for Unionville where freed slaves settled after the Civil War.\n\"We are honoring the 18 soldiers from the U.S. colored troops during the Civil War that created the town of Unionville,\" he said. \"It is amazing I still get choked up when I read these words.\"\nThe African American history within 10 miles of St. Stephens Church is remarkable. Not all of it is known or even written about. Sandy Johnson is working to change that.\n\"I am a budding historic preservationist,\" she said. \"It is good to honor those that came before us. It gives us a direction to know where we are going in life. Without the past you really can't move forward.\"\nThere were white participants in the crowd whose roots go way back too. Some of their relatives had owned big estates. Some have tilled this land for generations. A few got together to swap stories and show old black and white photographs. You could hear them saying old names too.\nThe Green Meadows Bluegrass Band finished playing \"Amazing Grace,\" the sounds of the music falling softly on the worn gravestones marked with the names of the Union soldiers \u2014 John Blackwell, Ennels Clayton, Isaac Copper, John Copper, Benjamin Demby, Charles Demby, William Doane, William Doran, Horace Gibson, Zachary Glasgow, Joseph Gooby, Joseph H.

    "content": "Nause-Waiwash aim to preserve, uncover history of Native Americans from Dorchester County\n\n August 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 567\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Since 1989, the Nause-Waiwash Band of Indians have preserved, honored and passed down the stories of their ancestors, many of whom were Nanticoke people living along the Choptank River.Chief Donna Wolf Mother Abbott is the band's leader. The group preserves the tradition of the indigenous people who fled in the 1700s to the marshes after being converged on by foreign settlers.\nAbbott's passion for exploring the county's native history began when she enrolled in the Nause-Waiwash around 20 years ago, though she wasn't always dead set on joining.\n\"There were probably two, three, maybe four generations that were brought up believing that it was disgraceful to claim your heritage, so they didn't teach it to their children,\" Abbott said. \"And my grandmother was one of those.\"\nAbbott's cousins convinced her to enroll around 10 years before she became the band's second chief in 2014, following the death of former Chief Sewell Winterhawk Fitzhugh.\n\"They brought up a very good point, and that was, 'If you don't (join), how are we going to preserve the history?'\" Abbott recalled her cousins telling her. \"'Because it's fading, it's dying quickly. And what are you going to tell your grandchildren?'\"\nThe Nause-Waiwash is made up of around 300 descendants of not just the Nanticoke, but Choptank and Pocomoke people as well. Nause was a Nanticoke village outside of Vienna and Waiwash a Choptank village outside of Cambridge, Abbott said.\nIt's a \"matrilineal society,\" one where the women hold the power to elect a chief and make important decisions. At meetings, the nonprofit organization plans upcoming events and collaborations with other tribes in the state, along with discussing heritage and history.\nTwo churches \u2014 Hughes African Methodist Episcopal Chapel near Cambridge and Wesley Chapel south of Cambridge in Andrews \u2014 are being renovated so the Nause-Waiwash can provide services and have a resource center. The organization is hosting its 32nd annual Native American Festival on Sept. 14 in Vienna.\nSuch outreach events are meant to educate people on the history of who occupied Dorchester land, but also how Native Americans treated the land and surrounding waters.\nUNCOVERING HISTORYDespite living on the Western Shore, Erin Kennedy, a member of the Nause-Waiwash, often combs through records and land deeds in and around Taylor's Island, the community in which she grew up, hoping to piece together her mother's side of the family.\nShe took inspiration from her uncle, who created a family tree for her father's side of the family.\nOnline resources, records from the Maryland State Archives and discussions with fellow indigenous descendants on the Eastern Shore have helped Kennedy and other members of the Nause-Waiwash understand their line of ancestors.\nAbbott emphasized that she's learning every day as well. She's uncertain if permanent state recognition is in the Nause-Waiwash's future given that it's not quite as large as other tribes. However, recent recognitions such as a historical roadside marker next to the Choptank River have raised the prominence of the dedicated nonprofit's work.\nNearly 10 years in, Abbott is developing a love and commitment to the work of the Nause-Waiwash.\n\"I have this passion for it, which I never really knew I had until I became involved,\" Abbott said. \"And I do know that a lot of our history is gone. I want to read all these books and see if I can't find some new information out that I don't know. So I'm reading books that I'd never thought I'd ever read before.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The next day, another window was broken. The day after that, someone broke her back door and her back windows. They stole her son's football trophy.It wasn't just Speed. Two other houses on her street had windows and doors broken. That's unusual for the neighborhood established in the late 1800s, Speed says. Until recently, residents all lived in peace, without fear of crime.\nSo Speed, the unofficial matriarch of Turner Station, decided to get to work.\n\"I did not feel that spirit from God to get the police,\" she said in an interview on July 24. \"So now we are trying to work with the children of new families that have moved to historic Turner station.\"\nOn Saturday, she held an event to educate new residents about the neighborhood's history. It started with a service inside the dimly lit Union Baptist Church.\nJaBrea Rodgers presided over much of the service and told about a dozen attendees about her great-grandmother, Henrietta Lacks, whose \"immortal cells\" helped a Johns Hopkins Hospital researcher study cancer cures.\nLacks moved to Turner Station in 1941 so her husband could work at the nearby Bethlehem Steel plant. She was hospitalized with cervical cancer, and a surgeon removed her cells and sent them to Dr. George Gey, the researcher. He shipped the cells to Philadelphia, Speed said. When the cells returned, they were still living \u2014 in fact, they had multiplied.\nHer cells still live.\nAfter the service finished, Speed led the small crowd to the headquarters of her movement, Save the Nation of Turner Station, at 411 Main St., where tables, chairs and a vendor selling watermelon pieces and chips awaited them.\nBill Barry, a retired labor studies professor at the Community College of Baltimore County, Dundalk, held a lecture about Turner Station and Bethlehem Steel, which employed many residents during its heyday.\nThen Andrew Morton, who worked at Bethlehem Steel in the blast furnace smelting metals, reminisced to the the dozen-strong crowd about his time \u2014 the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\"OSHA didn't come into the plant until 1974,\" he said. \"Every other week, somebody was getting killed or maimed. Three or four of my buddies that went down there with me are not here today. They got killed on the blast furnace.\"\nAlong with educating new residents, Speed worked to raise money for the revitalization of the somewhat blighted Turner Station. She's asking 1 billion people to donate $1 to the cause.\nIn previous years, Barry said, the event had a much larger turnout and included horses, games and kids. Speed said the organizers didn't have time to distribute flyers to the new neighbors, the rainy forecast gave many pause and the horses were unable to come because of the collapsed Key Bridge.\nStill, Speed called the event a success.\n\"Put us down, Lord willing, for next year. If we are gone, the next generation that was here, we have asked them to come on,\" she said. \"So we're going to replicate, repair and repurpose.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is now on display in his office. That rug includes 99 names of God in Arabic. Rabbi Hyman views it as a metaphorical bridge connecting people of different faiths.\nHe once asked the leaders of a mosque if they could help him translate some of the Arabic words on his rug. They did so, amazed that such an inclusive rug was owned and displayed by a rabbi.\nFor Rabbi Hyman, it was simply his belief that \"building relationships not only creates friendships, but they also cement ties.\"\nA partial list of his local efforts to improve the quality of life in our community and beyond, includes serving as a member, program vice president and president of the Talbot Association of Clergy and Laity. He received an Award of Appreciation for Outstanding and Inspiring Interfaith Work in Talbot County for a Temple B'nai Israel February Lecture Series: \"Introduction to Islam.\"\nHe was a recipient of the NAACP Dorothy Webb Black Community Service Legacy Award and a recipient of a Governor William Donald Schaefer Helping People Award. He was a member of The Frederick Douglass Celebration Committee and delivered the sermon at the Community Interfaith Worship Celebration, which was a part of the \"Douglass Returns\" statue dedication.\nAn author and teacher, he served as a presenter and instructor at Chesapeake College's Institute for Adult Learning and collaborated with Bishop Joel Marcus Johnson to launch a \"Downtown Lunch and Learn\" program. He was elected to the board of directors at the YMCA of the Chesapeake and appointed chair of the board at the Easton YMCA.\nSupport for Scouting has been a huge part of Rabbi Hyman's life since he earned his Eagle Scout award, as did his two sons. That is an achievement that has been earned by only 6% of all Scouts since 1912.\nHe has served as a scoutmaster and a chaplain at Scout World Jamborees in Thailand, England, Sweden and Japan and a National Jamboree in the United States. He was the first national chair for the Messengers of Peace Program, BSA, after having served as a national chair of the Jewish Committee on Scouting and as national Jewish chaplain \u2014 Boy Scouts of America. He was the keynote speaker at a national annual meeting of the BSA \"Duty to God Breakfast\" in Washington, D.C.\nHe is a recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award for distinguished service to youth awarded by the National Council of Boy Scouts of America. He is also a recipient of the Bronze Wolf Award, which is the Scouts' highest honor. It is presented by the World Scout Committee to recognize the service, commitment and contributions of volunteers to the Scout movement. Not surprisingly Hyman received the award for his interfaith activities and his lifelong commitment to \"building bridges between people and nations.\"\nRabbi Hyman represented the BSA in Saudi Arabia at Saudi Nation Day when they received an award for the work of the BSA with the Messengers of Peace Program. This program promotes service projects through social media in effort to achieve world peace.\nHyman recalls that trip as the most amazing experience of his life because he was welcome in a Muslim country.\nWhile the news of Rabbi Hyman's impending retirement is bittersweet, there is some good news.\nHe is not planning to leave the Eastern Shore.\nWhether he stays here for the short term or long term, one thing is certain. He has made countless selfless contributions to help make Easton, Talbot County, and our world a better place.\nEach one of them has earned Rabbi Hyman a well-deserved thank you and Godspeed.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant based in Easton. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Frederick Douglass Day continues to share abolitionist's legacy\n\n October 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Wendy Weitzel wweitzel@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 577\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The first time Harriette Lowery heard that Frederick Douglass had grown up in Talbot County was when she moved back to Easton with her husband in the early 2000s.Lowery was surprised to hear of Douglass' local origins. She had grown up in Talbot County, but she had never known it was the famed abolitionist's birthplace.\n\"The historical society had put a notice in the paper asking for people to respond to a question \u2014 'Is anybody interested in honoring Frederick Douglass in some way since he's our native son.' And I read that and thought, 'I knew a lot about Frederick Douglass, but I did not know he was from Talbot County,'\" she said Saturday, surveying the crowd outside the Talbot County Free Library that had assembled for the annual Frederick Douglass Day celebration.\n\"... I was a little embarrassed by that but more interested in doing something because of that,\" Lowery said.\nLowery and her late husband became founding members of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society, the group that spearheaded the process of having a statue of Douglass erected on the Talbot County Court House lawn. The statue was unveiled to a crowd of thousands in June, 2011, after years of sometimes tense back-and-forth between the honor society, members of the community and local governments.\nFrederick Douglass Day evolved from that unveiling ceremony in an effort to continue the honor society's mission of educating the community about Douglass.\n\"Since 2011, the Frederick Douglass Honor Society decided that it wanted to continue efforts to continue the legacy of Frederick Douglass,\" said Walter Black, another founding member of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society. \"So the main thing that we concentrated on is the Frederick Douglass Day.\"\nOn Saturday, Frederick Douglass Day filled downtown Easton with a parade, a ceremony, a lecture, a children's village and a city block filled with vendors, nonprofits and live entertainment.\n\"The event gets bigger and better every year,\" said Debbi Dodson, the Frederick Douglass Day event coordinator. \"More people get involved and more people attend, so that is a sign that people appreciate it and really support it.\"\nThe keynote speaker for this year's event, Keidrick Roy, said that although this was his first time visiting Talbot County, he has been working with the Frederick Douglass Honor Society for several years.\nKeidrick Roy, a fellow at Harvard University, signed copies of his new book, \"American Dark Age: Racial Feudalism and the Rise of Black Liberalism,\" at the event. Roy said Douglass is heavily featured in the work.\n\"I've always wanted to be in the place where Frederick Douglass walked and talked and had many of his formative experiences, so it's very special for me to be here to do this,\" he said. \"I loved the celebration this morning, seeing so many people from different parts of the city, different parts of the town come out and honor Douglass in a variety of ways.\"\nIn holding the event every year, Lowery said the honor society hopes to ensure that all members of the community are aware of Douglass's ties to Talbot County and of how the principles of equality and freedom that Douglass espoused are still relevant today.\n\"What we wanted was for everybody to look at Douglass as an American hero and not an African American hero,\" Lowery said.\nOn Saturday, Lowery remarked that Talbot County had made progress toward that goal since 2011.\n\"We're always growing and getting better, or we should be anyway,\" she said. \"Every year, I know that there's progress.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Understanding Latinidad: Educator speaks to Chesapeake College students\n\n October 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 639\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS \u2014 Dozens of students, faculty and community members gathered at the Wye Mills Humanities Cadby Theatre and enjoyed jamaica (hibiscus) agua fresca, fresh fruit, piles of spicy chips and an encouraging message of embracing their native cultures.In celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, Chesapeake College's Hispanic/Latino Student Union hosted advocate, educator and teacher Samantha Martinez to speak on what her Latinidad means to her.\nLindsay Velasquez, president of the Hispanic/Latino Student Union, said she was excited to bring Martinez as a speaker and loved the encouragement she shared with students in attendance to feel empowered by their cultural identity.\n\"I just feel like all of us feel like we can do it, and that little doubt that we had of not being able to do something, like, we can do it,\" Velasquez said. \"And she's an example of anything that is possible if you put your mind to it.\"\nLatinidad is a particular experience that contains the complexities of immigration, race, color, class and language. Martinez said her story stems from an immigration story.\n\"I'm really proud of that because of (my parents') struggle, and their survival and their grit, I'm able to stand here in front of you today,\" she said.\nHer mother migrated from Mexico and her father from El Salvador. She grew up in Chicago, which she describes as \"a city that really appreciated and celebrated what it means to be Latina,\" though the city was heavily segregated.\nAfter meeting her husband and getting married, she moved to New York and became a teacher in the South Bronx, known as the poorest school district in the country. There, Martinez learned of excellence.\nShe said she was expected to perform at a level of excellence that she had never been asked to before, and in turn she learned to expect it from the people and students around her.\nShe said the South Bronx \"will forever be a part of my story and my legacy.\"\nAfter spending her time in the South Bronx, Martinez moved to Talbot County. It was a culture shock, but to her surprise, she found a growing Latino population. Her new home also forced her to affirm and challenge her own identity as a Latina.\nMartinez worked for Talbot County Public Schools and then founded Mid-Shore Scholars, a college prep program that serves first-generation college students.\nWhen leading the program, she decided it was time to focus on the marginalized student population. The program was meant to target a population of students who had the potential to go to Ivy Leagues, but she pushed for a different perspective. Martinez said it was important to focus on the students who lacked the resources to get to college.\n\"It's these students who don't have any help at home, who don't have any representation, whose parents want to give them the best life but didn't go to college here, who don't know the ropes or don't know how to navigate the system,\" Martinez said.\nDuring the pandemic, she decided to focus on building an institution to better assist marginalized communities and helped create the Polaris Village Academy. Martinez said the academy centers joy, celebrating culture and empowering students and families, making them feel safe and seen.\nMartinez ended her presentation with photos of her family visiting their native countries and the importance that focusing on her roots allowed her the opportunity to help those around her to grow.\n\"My superpower is that I am bicultural, that I have roots in (El Salvador) and in Mexico, and I have roots here, and that I can be both from there and from here, and then it's not 'and/or.' I could bring my whole self,\" Martinez said. \"And I encourage all the students here who are questioning their identity or wondering if they can be authentically themselves when they go to class or when they step into white institutions that yes, you can.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Along with the Delmarva Pride Center, the event was hosted by DoCo Pride and the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus.\nThe four-person panel \u2014 which included Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick), Fair's Chief of Staff Camila Reynolds-Dominguez, FreeState Justice Executive Director Phillip Westry and Maryland Office of the Attorney General Civil Rights Division Chief Jonathan Smith \u2014 answered questions related to schools and workplace, health care and family law.\nCaleb Holland, an attorney and the chair of DoCo Pride, who moderated the town hall, said the goal of the event is \"to prepare, not scare.\"\nOn the topic of education, Smith said he expects the Trump administration will try to push through executive orders around funding schools that are based on sports issues, bathrooms or the ability to deadname or misgender students. But Smith said there are \"very significant responses\" states can make.\n\"There's been a body of law that's developed that says the United States government cannot, through its funding powers, coerce states to take policy decisions that are not for the function of funding,\" he said.\nWestry said organizing and getting active in politics, like school boards, is a good way to get involved.\nAlthough part of Wednesday night's conversation focused on bracing for what could happen in the country, the panelists also talked about what gives them hope.\nFair, who is the chair of the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus, recalled the 2018 midterm elections. He said the country elected more women, more queer people and more people of color than ever before.\n\"In 2018, we figured out that in order to protect our rights, we need to do everything we can to put as many people who look like us into positions of power,\" he said. \"What I am hopeful for is that 2026 looks just like that.\"\nReynolds-Dominguez, who was previously a policy advocate and legal impact coordinator at FreeState Justice, said that in the last couple of years, the state has taken an \"aggressive stance\" on doing everything possible to anticipate rollbacks. She said Maryland is \"situated to weather this storm\" and that should be used as a catalyst for doing long-term work.\n\"The core of all of this is shifting people's hearts and minds,\" she said. \"And if we're not doing that work, we're spending our time in the wrong place.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So we're so thrilled that it's going to keep on going because we all have a dream.\"\nSome individuals were not able to attend due to the weather, but the organizers quickly improvised to keep the program going as scheduled.\nThe Lockerman Middle School chorus and band offered multiple selections, which attendees enjoyed.\nCaroline County Commissioner Frank Bartz spoke on behalf of the Caroline County Commissioners, explaining the importance of King's legacy.\n\"While we honor Dr. King's life, we also acknowledge that the work he began continues in Caroline County,\" Bartz said. \"We are trying to build a community, and inclusivity is more than just a word, it's a commitment ensuring that every person, regardless of background, is treated with dignity and respect.\"\nCaroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derrick Simmons spoke on behalf of the district, explaining the importance of what King did and how Caroline County brings that mentality into its schools.\n\"I believe education is one of the most powerful tools in achieving Dr King's dream,\" Simmons said. \"Every day in our schools, we strive to create environments where diversity is celebrated, all voices are heard, and discrimination has no place.\"\nA mother and daughter duo from Metropolitan United Methodist Church offered poetry reciting of \"Reverend Martin Luther King\" written by Dr. Maya Angelou from mother Nikeisha Ogletree and a dance selection from daughter Laila Ogletree.\nClosing out the program, Sammy Scott from New Beginnings United Methodist Church Division of Maryland recited King's \"I have a dream\" speech.\nThe most amazing part of the 13th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day program for Molock was the participation of the local youth.\n\"Oh, it does my heart well,\" Molock said. \"I'm a former educator, so to see the kids here and not home in bed, but getting out that student involvement is just so special.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge Woman's Club hosts presentation about obtaining citizenship\n\n February 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 492\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Seeing herself as a voice for Federalsburg's Haitian community, Gelard Merilus Loulou attended the Cambridge Woman's Club Friday to gather helpful information that she can take back to Federalsburg.Friday afternoon, the club hosted Lindsay Waite, a retired attorney who currently volunteers at the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center in Easton to help those who are applying for United States citizenship prepare.\nMerilus Loulou said Federalsburg's Haitian community is \"in crisis,\" with many fearful about what could happen in the county in the coming months when it comes to immigration.\nWith a new administration in the White House, there has been a push to crack down on illegal immigration, which has caused concern among migrants in the United States.\nDuring her presentation, Waite spoke about the process for naturalization in the U.S. She explained that to gain citizenship, a person must file a Form N-400 application for naturalization, have their biometrics taken, pass a background check, pass the citizenship test and complete an interview with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If the person is approved after these steps, they will need to take the Oath of Allegiance at a naturalization ceremony.\nWaite said she believes the process costs about $800 to complete.\nAt the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, Waite and other volunteers help prepare those with green cards who want to obtain citizenship. She said volunteers help go over the Form N-400 application, review questions that could be on the test and practice reading and writing.\nWaite said the citizenship test includes an English portion and also asks questions about democracy, the constitution, history and geography.\nOffering some of the more difficult questions to the audience at the event, Waite said the people she works with come in for about 10 weeks to review questions and practice English.\n\"They learn a lot more than I think my nephew, who went to high school and college, could probably know,\" she said, causing people in the audience to laugh.\nClaudia White-Cooke and Joyce Dowling, who attended Waite's presentation, said after hearing some of the questions on the test, they weren't sure if they'd be able to pass it. White-Cooke said the process to become a citizen seems complicated and the people who apply are really committed.\nWhen one person at the event asked if the new presidential administration has affected the naturalization process at all, Waite \u2014 who said she is not an expert on what's happening at the national level \u2014 said she did notice a change in priority for legal entry into the U.S. from Venezuela.\n\"To a limit, a certain number of people from Venezuela were being given entry legally and now that's stopped,\" she said.\nWaite said she believes the naturalization process in the U.S. will continue, however. She said people still want to be American citizens.\n\"And I and others will do what we can to help,\" she said.\nThose who are interested in volunteering with the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center or want to learn more can call 877-772-9832 or visit chesmrc.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "State, county leaders join Frederick Douglass descendants to unveil new plaque\n\n February 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 482\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Exactly 130 years after Frederick Douglass' death, the Talbot County-born abolitionist and civil rights leader was honored for his lasting impact on freedom, equality and education.Descendants, county leaders and state transportation officials gathered to unveil a historical marker honoring Douglass at the Talbot County Courthouse Thursday morning. They were joined by Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller.\nMiller spoke at the unveiling, noting that Douglass' calls for justice still demand answers to date. She pointed out the crucial role he played in advancing education for Black Americans during a time when it was not widely accepted.\n\"Frederick Douglass dared to see beyond the chains that bound him,\" Miller said. \"He knew that true liberation was not just freedom of the body, but freedom of the mind.\"\nThe marker, one of nearly 800 official historical signs created by the Maryland Department of Transportation, will be placed at Tappers Corner Road and Route 303, just northeast of Cordova and near Douglass' birthplace.\nJulie Schablitsky, cultural resources chief for the Maryland Department of Transportation, said after working with Douglass family descendants and community members, an addition was made to the text on the historical marker: Anna Murray.\nMurray, Douglass' first wife, was \"strong\" and \"loyal,\" Schablitsky said. Many speakers Thursday maintained that Murray's fight for equality and justice was just as important as Douglass'.\nSchhablitsky noted Murray was crucial in Douglass' escape from slavery, sewing the sailor suit he used to disguise himself while fleeing north.\nKenneth Morris Jr., Douglass' great-great-great-grandson, called Murray an \"equal partner\" to her husband.\n\"It was Anna who made his escape possible,\" Morris said. \"Her strength, sacrifice and unwavering support ensured that his journey to freedom was not just his alone, but part of a greater fight for justice that continues today. I'm just as proud of her as I am of him.\"\n\"Her story reminded me that during difficult and challenging times, we must rely on each other and sometimes risk our own safety for the ones we love,\" Scablitsky said.\nOther local and state officials spoke during the event, including Department of Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld, Talbot County Council President Chuck Callahan and Easton Mayor Megan Cook.\nEdward \"Boots\" Robinson, president of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society, and Tarence Bailey, Douglass' five-time great nephew, provided words as well.\n\"No place is more important to mark his footsteps than where Frederick Douglass experienced his first taste of freedom while living with his grandparents, enjoying those few spiritful, joyful years,\" Robinson said.\nBailey said that when he was growing up in Easton, many of his elders didn't openly discuss the history of slavery in the area. Descendants of Harriet Tubman weren't allowed to talk about Tubman outside their houses, Bailey said.\nThe roadside marker will give the younger generations a chance to learn about that history and the local legacy of Douglass, Bailey said.\n\"We didn't have this,\" Bailey said. \"So to be able to give it to the next generation is really special.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the Associated Press, changes to the webpage included the removal of a photo of Tubman from the top of the page and text edits that removed references to slavery and changed descriptions.\nThe changes to the site came amid the efforts to remove diversity, equity and inclusion policies in the federal government.\nLast week, it was announced that changes to the webpage had been reversed.\nAccording to the Associated Press, a National Park Service spokesperson said the changes were made without approval. The spokesperson said the agency celebrates Tubman.\nIn her statement, Harris said she is \"saddened\" to know the current administration \"is making a concerted effort to rewrite and erase history.\"\nHarriet Tubman, an abolitionist and social activist who was born into and escaped from slavery in Dorchester County in the 19th century, became well known for her work on the Underground Railroad, a network of routes and safe houses that helped slaves escape to their freedom. At the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center in Cambridge, visitors can learn about the legacies of Tubman and other influential African Americans from the Eastern Shore.\nHarris said that along with Tubman's legacy, the center will never forget Frederick Douglass, William Still and others who \"documented and informed the nation of the atrocities of slavery.\"\n\"Tributes shall be given to freedom seekers, abolitionists and the many who endured and fought to end slavery in America!\" Harris said. \"We are evermore emboldened to tell their stories.\" \n\n Copyright  2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Turning back the clock? Five years after George Floyd\u2019s death, race in America faces Trump-driven changes and crossroads\n\n May 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: National \n \n 1397\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in May 2020, Irving Joyner and Rob Carpenter saw some signs of change when it came to race relations in America.Police agencies were pressed for more transparency and greater ability to charge officers accused of wrongdoing. Major employers, federal agencies, universities and progressive communities launched diversity and inclusion initiatives.\nFive years after Floyd's death and ensuing protests and unrest, Joyner, a law professor at North Carolina Central University, is less optimistic.\n\"Now the opposite is occurring,\" Joyner said. \"There is a retrenchment.\"\nHe points to efforts by the Trump administration and other conservatives to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs and affirmative action hiring requirements, the directions of policies related to immigration and refugees and rollbacks of legal oversight sought by the Biden administration with the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments after the killings of Floyd and Breonna Taylor in 2020.\n\"The playbook seems to be pretty clear. There is an effort to undermine all the racial progress,\" Joyner said, contending DEI programs criticized by conservatives aim to be pathways to seeing the benefits of a pluralistic society.\n\"We see the parallels and the perils,\" Joyner said of the current landscape and America's history with race.\n'PROTECTING COMMUNiTIES' Since returning to power in January, President Donald Trump has shut down DEI programs (including in the U.S. military) and affirmative action hiring requirements for federal agencies and contractors.\nTrump argues for a \"merit-based society\" and conservatives say DEI and affirmative action policies disadvantage white people and continue to classify people along racial lines.\nThe U.S. Justice Department on May 21 said that it is dismissing federal lawsuits and proposed consent decrees with police in Minneapolis and Louisville in response to the Floyd and Taylor incidents.\n\"Overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.\nDhillon said the moves aim to end the Biden administration's \"failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments.\"\nA White House spokesperson said Trump is focused on safety and prosperity \"for all Americans\" and empowering law enforcement.\n\"President Trump is tirelessly enacting policies to ensure America's safety, prosperity, and success for all Americans. Through his Make America Safe Again agenda, the Trump Administration is committed to stopping crime, upholding justice, protecting communities, and empowering federal, state, and local law enforcement,\" said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields.\nThe White House said the president is not considering a pardon of Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer convicted of killing Floyd in May 2020.\nTrump has pressed the District of Columbia to remove Black Lives Matter street murals near the White House and wants to restore names of military bases that bore the names of Confederate generals.\nJoyner and Carpenter, an author and communications professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, feel undercurrents to Trump's rhetoric and agendas.\nThey see cultural and racial undertones to Trump's hard lines on immigration (including his efforts to end birthright citizenship), his nostalgia for a \"Golden Age\" of America and his administration's cuts to foreign aid and refugee programs for developing countries while launching a new one for white Afrikaner farmers from South Africa.\n\"Trump is perceived as turning back the clock,\" Carpenter said.\n'HUMAN NATURE'S SCRIPT'Carpenter sees societal swings after Floyd's death went viral on social media, highlighting police misconduct and America's complicated history of racial and social inequities.\n\"I do think there has been some progress,\" Carpenter said, noting some of the efforts related to policing.\nBut Carpenter said plenty of challenges remain citing research showing 75% of white people do not have friends of color and 66% of Black people don't have any white friends.\nCarpenter said African Americans still face obstacles and discrimination with jobs, noting a 2024 study that found job applicants with 'white-sounding' names were 50% more likely to get callbacks from employers than 'Black-sounding' names.\n\"It's an ongoing trauma. It's still a daily experience,\" Carpenter said of America's racial challenges.\nBut he also said the experiences of race in America and the current pushback to diversity and affirmative action programs have global and historical parallels.\n\"It's all throughout history where a majority population tends to favor themselves and dismiss the complaints of minorities,\" Carpenter said.\nHe said when minority rights are focused on, majority populations tend to feel they are being aggrieved.\n\"It's nothing new under the sun,\" Carpenter said. \"They are just following the human nature script.\"\nECHO CHAMBERSOthers on the frontlines of the social landscape see a mixed bag with the current state of race in America.\nErica Williams, executive director of A Red Circle, a St. Louis-based racial equity group, welcomed post-Floyd police changes such as body cameras and civilian review boards, but said the community distrust of law enforcement persists.\nShe said the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic \"deepened every pre-existing divide \u2014 especially in food access, education and health care.\"\nHer group has launched community food programs to help with post-pandemic inflation with U.S. prices up 25% since the pandemic.\n\"We grew more produce, hired youth interns, launched workshops and distributed thousands of pounds of fresh food to families,\" she said.\nAdant\u00e9 Pointer, a California-based civil rights attorney, sees ups and downs with policing since 2020.\n\"We are seeing officers prosecuted more frequently than before,\" he said. \"However, police shootings and killings have gone up.\"\nLast year, police killings of civilians totaled 1,365 persons, the highest on record, according to Mapping Police Violence.\nThere were 1,159 police-involved deaths in 2020.\nWhite people made up 42.7% of the 2024 deaths while accounting for 59% of the total population. Black people accounted for one-quarter of fatal police incidents while making up 13% of the population.\nPointer said the dominance of social media in contemporary discourse offers an opportunity to learn more about others and their paths. But it also mirrors societal biases and beliefs and technology algorithms allow users to stay in their ideological and social lanes.\n\"It becomes an echo chamber,\" he said.\nGOODBYE DEI?Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York, sees racial pendulums throughout American history.\nHe said there has been progress in narrowing racial income, education and employment gaps but worries about Trump \"appealing to white grievance.\"\nNeiman said. \"It also assumes that Black people have used racism as a weapon to win special privileges at the expense of whites .. It is dangerous: It diverts attention from the real racial disparities in our society and from developing policies to address them.\"\nThe U.S. poverty rate stands at 11% with 18% of African-Americans, 17% of Hispanic Americans, 19% of immigrants and 8% of white Americans living in poverty, according to U.S. Census data and FederalSafetyNet.com.\nSome of the companies and organizations that embraced DEI efforts after Floyd's death have jettisoned those efforts amid pushback from Trump and conservatives.\nOthers have faulted DEI programs as patronizing and self-serving.\n\"DEI is embraced by the business community when they think it will enhance their bottom lines,\" Pointer said. \"They are more than willing to walk away when it's not popular.\"\nSeveral large U.S. businesses, brands and technology firms have sought warm relations with Trump since he returned to power, attending and bankrolling his inauguration and attending other White House events.\nMuneer Panjwani, CEO of Engage for Good (which connects businesses and nonprofits) said DEI programs have driven \"meaningful progress.\"\n\"Companies have become significantly more aware of systemic racism and structural barriers faced by marginalized communities, taking actionable steps toward equity,\" he said.\nBut Panjwani acknowledges Trump has leveraged feelings of alienation among some white people. He also said equity conversations have sometimes been framed too narrowly, overlooking class, gender and other factors.\nCarpenter said white working-class Americans, who have seen stagnant wages and high inflation, have felt unheard in contemporary discourses.\nAll that comes amid post-pandemic financial strains and concentrations of wealth.\n\"Economic inequality has reached alarming levels, with the richest 1% holding over 31% of the nation's wealth while nearly half of Americans still struggle with unexpected financial burdens,\" Panjwani said.\nWilliams said her Missouri-based stays focused on its local work, including a community farm that grows its own food and is looking to offer its own grocery store and food production kitchen.\n\"We've seen an escalation of rhetoric and policymaking that undermines inclusive education, equity initiatives and even basic access programs. In that environment, I stay focused on building what my community needs,\" she said\nCarpenter agrees that it takes popular and grassroots changes in mindsets to move the needle.\n\"Politicians never lead,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "DEI is about giving everybody an opportunity\n\n June 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPHEN RIDEOUT | Section: Columns \n \n 600\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I am reading \"How We Learn to Be Brave\" by Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington.In her book, she writes about Thurgood Marshall and the challenges that he faced during his life.\n\"When he was denied admission to the University of Maryland School of Law on the basis of race, he reluctantly applied to Howard University School of Law, which he considered a far less reputable institution,\" she writes.\nThat interested me because I was aware that when he became a lawyer, he and the NAACP successfully sued the University of Maryland Law School in the case of Murray v. Pearson for denying Black students admission because of their race. It also interested me because of conversations I had with two men who had similar experiences.\nOne was a retired judge, who told me that he had gone to Howard and graduated as valedictorian. Thurgood Marshall asked him to apply to the University of Virginia Law School thinking that they would deny him admission, despite his qualifications, so that he could be Marshall's plaintiff in a lawsuit against the university.\nWhen he applied to UVA, he was not denied admission. Rather, he was approached by a wealthy benefactor of the university with the offer to pay for his law education at any other law school that would accept him. The retired judge accepted the offer, went to law school in New York, and had to tell Mr. Marshall that he would not be the plaintiff in that lawsuit.\nGregory Swanson became the successful plaintiff in that lawsuit against the rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia brought by the NAACP with Thurgood Marshall being one of the lawyers where Mr. Swanson was granted admission to the law school.\nSeveral years after my discussion with the retired judge, I had a chance meeting with Rep. Alcee Hastings from Florida. I sat near him on a plane trip and told him the story of the experience the retired judge had as a student. Interestingly, Congressman Hastings told me that it was not an isolated event, as the same thing had happened to him and had also happened to African Americans who had applied to medical schools in the South.\nSchools and alumni offered to pay their way to a graduate school in the north to avoid the litigation that might come from the denial of admission to the school to which they applied. While some may have been denied admittance, others were offered some benefit to go elsewhere such as the payment of their tuition at a law school or medical school elsewhere in the U.S.\nWhen I hear complaints about diversity, equity and inclusion, I never hear the full story of the background or reasoning for these complaints. I see the DEI effort not as promoting unqualified people to a position but rather giving all people the opportunity to be considered for a position who might otherwise be excluded from being considered. Giving everyone the opportunity to compete and learn from the experience, whether hired, admitted or not, seems to me to benefit everyone.\nColleges and universities have done something similar for many years for the children of alumni of their institutions where the child might not be considered the most qualified candidate but is admitted. How is that not favoritism based on connections rather than on skills and past accomplishments? In Cambridge during my time in city government, the search for qualified city employees included anyone interested and always tried to find people who were a good fit for our community who had the potential to become great and long-term workers for the city. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Still matters today': Community to read famous Frederick Douglass speech on Saturday\n\n July 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 499\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 On July 5, 1852, Frederick Douglass asked a burning question in front of hundreds of abolitionists in Rochester, New York: \"What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\"The Talbot County native, often considered the most important abolitionist and civil rights leader of his time, delivered an address that described why enslaved African Americans weren't afforded the same freedoms and liberties that could allow them to celebrate the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence like the rest of the nation.\nDouglass' famous speech is still popular 173 years later. On Saturday, the Easton-based Frederick Douglass Honor Society is hosting an annual community reading. Local officials, community leaders, residents and children are reading aloud portions of the address on the lawn of the Talbot County Courthouse starting at 10 a.m.\nVickie Wilson, the society's treasurer, says this year's calendar couldn't have worked out any better, with the event falling on the same day Douglass spoke to the Rochester Ladies Anti-Slavery Society.\n\"What's really exciting for us this year is that the first time Douglass read this speech was on July 5, 1852,\" Wilson said. \"And now, it falls again on July 5.\"\nThe Frederick Douglass Honor Society has held the reading annually since 2018, though it was put on pause last year for a separate event. Wilson says this year's return is exciting due to the diversity of people \u2014 in age, race, occupation and more \u2014 participating in the reading. Fifty-nine people are expected to step up to the podium.\n\"We live in a diverse community,\" Wilson said. \"It's going to show the love that we have for this community as well.\"\nDouglass in his 1852 speech explained the significantly different perspective enslaved people had on the Fourth of July holiday.\n\"What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim,\" Douglass said.\nHe continued: \"To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy \u2014 a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.\"\nWilson says the Talbot County tradition during the week of Independence Day is a moving one. She encourages people, no matter how they celebrate the holiday the rest of the week, to attend on Saturday.\nShe said the speech is a \"lot to unpack,\" but extremely powerful. It still resonates with her today, and she believes it does for many Talbot County residents.\n\"It still matters today,\" Wilson said. \"And I often think it matters more today in the climate that we're in right now. Everything here about this speech is still relevant.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This, even then, very narrow spit of land was entirely too small for the imprisoned population and must have collided with winter cold and intense summer sun.The recent efforts to alter our country's historical failings is, in my opinion, very dangerous. How many times have you heard parents say to their children, \"Remember, we learn from our mistakes.\"\nShould we not teach children about the Trial of Tears, where Native Americans were driven off their land and forced to relocate hundreds of miles from their homes?\nShould we not talk about the fear that drove the U.S. government to relocate Japanese men, women and children into interment camps? The officials who made the decision to move this population thought at the time that these individuals posed a real threat to the general population, particularly on the West Coast of the U.S.A.\nI grew up in the 1950s and 1960s. During my youth the country was trying to deal with Civil Rights issues. Every night on the news we saw demonstrations regarding this issue and heard Congress debate segregation versus integration. A decade later the Vietnam War was underway, and the country was split in many directions that were reflected in homes and on college campuses.\nLike many people my age I had to earn a living, and so I had to focus on the here and now as an employee. The daily tasks did not leave much time for debating politics with friends.\nI have seen in my lifetime people try to scapegoat the realities that both harmed and glorified our past.\nWe are an imperfect nation. Our forefathers created an engaging experiment. They created the greatest democracy ever witnessed on this planet.\nWe now have the opportunity to learn from our previous mistakes. I despise the fact that the Union Army starved and mistreated Southern soldiers, but that is a fact. I think it was a moral miscalculation to force Japanese families into prison campus, but that is a fact. The American Indian was relocated and forced to walk hundreds of miles from their land, but that's a fact. And old men and women can debate whether we should have ever placed ourselves in Vietnam, but we did, and that's a fact.\nThe role of the historian is to gather facts and tell us what took place and to provide the various options governments and individuals had when they made those decisions.\nHide the past, and it will only repeat itself.\nGILBERT MASTER\nPrince Frederick \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
