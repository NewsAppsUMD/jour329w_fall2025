She was elected president of the board in December 2020 and held the role through 2022.Moving forward, Delean-Botkin said she hopes the Board of Education continues to maintain the county's high graduation rate and low dropout rate, expand its Career and Technical Education completer courses and implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a statewide plan to increase public education funding, improve student outcomes and improve the quality of public education.\"The other big thing that we're very proud of is having as many students as wish to go ahead and take the Advanced Placement classes and exams,\" Delean-Botkin said.At a July 19 Talbot County Board of Education meeting, President Emily Jackson said the board wishes Delean-Botkin the best of luck.\"We will miss her words of wisdom and her guidance,\" Jackson said.Talbot County Public Schools Executive Assistant Charlene Gould said in an email that the governor's office has been notified of the vacancy and will appoint a new board member to fill Delean-Botkin's seat until elections in November 2024.She said interested candidates can submit an application to the Governor's Appointments Office.In June, Commissioners Tom Costigan and Jimmy Jaramillo appointed Delean-Botkin to fill Commissioner Brian Wells' seat.Wells resigned at the June 27 Commissioners of Oxford meeting. He said he was resigning because he was moving to Easton.Before being appointed, Delean-Botkin ran against and lost to now Commissioner Katrina Greer. Greer took the seat of Jaramillo, who did not seek reelection.Delean-Botkin said her new role as Oxford commissioner is a \"challenging\" one.\"I think what we have to look at is, Oxford a town of about 600 folks,\" she said.\"Three sides are surrounded by water, so we have limits on growth. People tend to want to move to Oxford because of the quality of life.Majority of people that I talk to do not want to see many things change. They want to maintain the integrity of the town.\" \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY MAGGIE TROVATO\n \nSusan Delean-Botkin has resigned from the Talbot County Board of Education. \n \n Memo: \"The other big thing that we're very proud of is having as many students as wish to go ahead and take the Advanced Placement classes and exams.\" - Susan Delean-Botkin \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "School district saves thousands in energy costs - Program focuses on use and use reduction\n\n August 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 17 | Section: News \n \n 581\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - Efforts by Caroline County Public Schools to reduce energy costs have resulted in almost $260,000 in savings as a result of a yearlong program managed by Cenergistic, an energy conservation company based in Dallas, Texas.Reporting at the Aug. 1 meeting of the Caroline County Board of Education, Cenergistic Client Manager Scott Muir shared a slide show depicting how the program has saved the school district money since July 1, 2022.School board president Richard Barton called the first annual report \"really exciting stuff.\" \"I've just got to give you guys big kudos,\" Muir said. \"This is one of the fastest and most successful starts to a program that I've seen.\" Muir and Superintendent Dr.Derek Simmons credited Cenergistic Energy specialist Josh Rein for his work in the district.\"Having Josh here from the very beginning\" was beneficial, Muir said. \"Typically we do have a challenge hiring an energy specialist from outside the district, so they have to develop all these relationships and try and do it quickly. And we just got off to a great start with him already knowing everyone here.\" Cenergistic created the energy conservation program that \"assists in minimizing the impact that cost increases has on the budget,\" according to the report. Four energy sources were considered: electricity, solar, heating oil and propane.The lion's share of cost increases was from electricity the school district buys from the grid at a 64% increase and heating oil with a 42% increase.\"There's not a whole lot we can do about the costs, so our company focuses on use and use reduction,\" Muir said.Relying on solar and setting back thermostats on weekends, nights and during the summer made a difference, Muir said.From July 2022 through June 2023, 80% of CCPS's utility spending was on electricity.\"That's a huge area of focus for Josh and our team,\" Muir said.However, even with the increases in energy costs, the public schools decreased energy use intensity (EUI) by 35%. Energy use intensity is a measure of 1,000 BTUs of energy per square foot, \"a benchmark that the EPA uses,\" Muir said. It's also used for Energy Star certification.\"It's a way of measuring elementary schools against other elementary schools, houses against houses, and the regional average here for K12 schools is 54 EUI,\" Muir said. \"When we started the program, you actually were doing pretty well; you were already at 50 EDI. And today, for the last 12 months, we're down to 32 EUI. So at that at that level, our company is going to be looking at getting certified for Energy Star for a lot of facilities.\" An \"energy savings day\" on Monday July 3, \"was a great little initiative and the results show,\" Muir said.Rein performed more than 1,516 building audits, \"and that equates to 1,451 metric tons of CO2 emissions avoided,\" Muir said. \"That's a huge environmental footprint.\" Muir compared the 1,451 metric tons of CO2, equating them to \"over 3.5 million miles driven by an average car,\" he said. \"That amount of energy can power 175 homes for the year.\" Cenergistic has a five-year contract with the Caroline County Public Schools.\"The message to the taxpayer is (our) more efficient use of money, and that's something you don't hear government say very often,\" Barton said.To view the full report, visit https://go.boarddocs.com/mabe/carps/Board.nsf/Public, open the Aug. 1 agenda and click on the \"Cenergistic Update\" link. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/TIMES RECORD\n \nCenergistic Client Manager Scott Muir shared a slide show depicting how the program has saved the school district over $250,000 since July 1, 2022 \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gambrill rushed to Woolford's office to report the attack, but the assistant principal sent Gambrill home without ensuring that she received medical treatment. Gambrill sustained a concussion from that incident, the plaintiffs asserted.The Gambrill family reported the attack to Collins, but said that Collins told them that substitute teachers are not trained well, cannot control the classroom and that \"boys will be boys,\" according to a statement of facts filed by the plaintiffs.A second violent incident occurred in a science class on Dec. 14, 2016, while students were under the supervision of another substitute teacher.Plaintiffs said Gambrill was attacked by another male student, who grabbed her neck and flipped her backward, causing her to strike her head. Gambrill suffered another concussion from the attack.The plaintiffs said the second substitute teacher witnessed the attack and allowed it to happen \"without any intervention.\" The same student who assaulted Gambrill on Dec. 14 struck her in the face on Dec. 19, 2016, while both were at the nurse's office, plaintiffs said.Gambrill attempted to defend herself by pushing the student away, but was never given an opportunity to tell her side of the story.Plaintiffs said that Woolford failed to investigate the incident and \"immediately\" handed Gambrill a two-day out-of-school suspension as punishment.Attorneys for the family said that the defendants \"exacted unjustified discipline\" on Gambrill that year through suspensions, denying her attendance on school trips and requiring her to sit alone at lunch. Woolford reportedly harassed Gambrill by sending her home to change clothes, according to the court filing.Plaintiffs assert that the defendants failed to properly address the family's concerns for Gambrill's safety and failed to properly supervise and train substitute teachers.In June 2019, a judge in Dorchester County Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts that remained, including the negligence claim.The Gambrill family appealed the circuit court's ruling on the negligence claim in July 2019. About two years later, the Appellate Court of Maryland affirmed the lower court's ruling.The Gambrill family filed a second appeal to the Supreme Court of Maryland shortly after. But last August, the state's highest court reversed both lower rulings and remanded the case back to Dorchester County for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.The trial is expected to conclude Friday, according to court records. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY CHRISTINA AU FDERHEIDE \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Board members asked questions about how the schools plan to track progress, address staffing vacancies and what things the board and community can do to help the schools reach their goals.Throughout the rest of the meeting, board members asked questions, initiated conversations and probed deeper about many of the meeting's agenda items.At the end of the meeting, board member Theresa Stafford gave her hopes for the school year.\"I hope that as we move forward as a board, the community does not have to guess where we are and where we're going,\" she said.\"This year we will be transparent in everything we do.\" Stafford said conversations are healthy and that hard conversations need to happen.\"One of the first things in moving forward,\" she said, \"(is) we have to be realistic.And we may not paint a rosy picture that everybody this year is going to sit here and smile and agree.\" Stafford said that, as board members, listening to the community and supporting teachers is vital.\"We are the voice of the people who elected us to make sure that we are doing the best we can for the kids we have and for the community that we serve,\" she said.Board member Chris Wheedleton said he's excited about making data-driven decisions this school year.

    "title": "'Contracted Out' - An unprecedented look at Maryland public school spending",
    "date": "2023-09-12",
    "author": "Local News Network University Of Maryland's Philip Merrill College Of Journalism",
    "content": "'Contracted Out' - An unprecedented look at Maryland public school spending\n\n September 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Local News Network University Of Maryland's Philip Merrill College Of Journalism | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1156\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Billions of local, state and federal tax dollars go to funding Maryland's public schools every year - and now, it will be easier for you to find out how your local school district spent that money.That's because the Local News Network at the University of Maryland has published an easily searchable database where you can look up your school district's vendor payments over the past four years.That database and an accompanying series of stories comprise \"Contracted Out,\" a project compiled over the past seven months by students and faculty at the UMD Philip Merrill College of Journalism. The \"Contracted Out\" database provides a comprehensive and unprecedented itemization of school contract spending statewide.\"If there is any corruption out there, it's through these contracts,\" said Marguerite Roza, director of Georgetown University's Edunomics Lab, a research institute that studies education funding data.\"Contracted Out\" gives local journalists and the general public something they've never had before: an easy way to review school district vendor payments.The \"Contracted Out\" database contains information from all 24 public school districts in Maryland, with the ability to break out individual districts. The database includes every vendor that was paid over $25,000 by each district between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years.The Local News Network turned more than 26,000 rows of raw data into news the public can use. School district payments for health insurance, buses, computers and meals - it's all there.Still, there are limits to the data.Vendor payments account for only a small portion of school funding in Maryland or any other state. Roza said the vast majority of school spending - 80% to 90% of it - goes to teacher and staff salaries, not vendors.The data used to construct the \"Contracted Out\" database - most of it obtained through the state's Open Data Portal - lacks detail. Most districts only have to report payments of more than $25,000, the name of the vendor and the ZIP code where the vendor is based. A quirk in state law requires only Baltimore County Public Schools to say why they spent what they spent.School districts have differing policies regarding which services they contract out and which they handle in-house. For example, some districts have their own bus fleets while others hire contractors to transport students.Districts also disagree on what constitutes a vendor payment. Most notably, some list state and federal taxes as vendor payments, but others exclude them from the data. For that reason, any district-by-district comparison of overall vendor payments would not be statistically valid.Even so, the data that's online serves a useful purpose, said Matthew Streett, assistant director in the state's Office of Legislative Audits.\"I look at it from a transparency and accountability standpoint,\" Streett said. \"The public wants to know where their taxpayer dollars are going when it comes to educating students.\" Streett's office routinely audits school district spending, as do district officials and inspector general offices in individual counties.Meanwhile, the Office of the State Inspector General for Education performs audits based on tips about possible wrongdoing.You can find details about some of the recent audits here.Those audits can spot big trouble. For example, an internal review of contracting in Montgomery County Public Schools last year found evidence of irregularities in the district's transportation department. A criminal investigation then led to a guilty plea to a felony theft charge by the department's former assistant director, as well as a guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge by the department's former director.But the checks and balances on school spending don't depend primarily on auditors and investigators.School boards review and authorize vendor payments, said Milton E. Nagel, executive director of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education.\"Maryland procurement laws apply to school districts,\" he said. \"School districts can't go out and stroke a million-dollar check to a vendor without going through a bid process.\" But Roza said school boards rarely go over vendor contracts line by line.\"They end up going into a consent agenda, and the whole board goes, 'Everybody want to approve the 91 contracts that we have coming before the board this month? All in favor? Aye,'\" she said.In most states, those contracts are published only in a school board's minutes, not online like in Maryland, Roza said.But the Local News Network found big problems with the school contracting data on the state's Open Data Portal.When work on the project began in January, huge chunks of data from four of the five largest school districts in the state were missing.Data was missing from several smaller districts, too - even though a 2019 act of the General Assembly requires districts to report vendor payments of over $25,000 with the Department of Budget and Management.Student journalists and Local News Network Director Jerry Zremski spent months prodding districts to comply with the law and provide the missing data.The last to do so, Baltimore City and Baltimore County, didn't do that until early June.Derek Willis, lecturer in computational and data journalism at Merrill College, then completed the work his students had begun: cleaning up the data so that every vendor was listed by the same name.A team of 38 student journalists reviewed the incomplete data before the spring semester ended and Zremski studied the late-arriving data.Their key findings will be included in the accompanying stories, but local journalists around the state and citizens may also want to take a close look at the data. As Roza noted, the people closest to the local school districts - reporters and citizens who live in those districts - will be the ones most likely to spot questionable vendor payments.In doing so, Roza said, people should remember one thing about school district vendor data: scandal can be rooted in them. She cited a case from Chicago, where the former CEO of the public school district ended up spending nearly three years in federal prison because she steered tens of millions in no-bid contracts to her friends.And Richard Henry, the state's inspector general for education, encouraged the public to contact his office if they see anything in the contracting data that seems suspicious.\"I always encourage individuals to give us a call, and if they want to remain anonymous, they can remain anonymous,\" Henry said.\"We continue to encourage outreach to all members of the education profession throughout the state and throughout the county governments to report any type of waste, fraud and abuse.\" Local News Network Director Jerry Zremski compiled this story based in part on the work of 38 Philip Merrill College of Journalism students who were enrolled in a mid-level reporting class in the spring semester.Kara Thompson of the Capital News Service Annapolis Bureau and Joel Lev-Tov, an independent study student with the Local News Network, contributed to this report. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nThe Talbot County Public Schools Education Foundation aims to close the \"digital divide\" that impacts hundreds of Talbot County students.\n \nAPG STAFF\n \nThis graph reflects the amount spent by the five Mid-Shore county school districts by vendor. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Audits show trouble lurking in school contracts\n\n September 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Kayla Nazaire; Capital News Service | Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 929\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Auditors keep a close eye on school district contracting in Maryland - and if you're wondering why, just look at what happened in May in Montgomery County.After auditors raised suspicions, the district's former assistant director of transportation pleaded guilty to stealing over $320,000 from the county's school system over a span of at least five years by misusing district purchasing cards and mismanaging a contract for the purchase of school buses.What's more, several state audits in recent years raised serious questions about contract spending in other Maryland public school districts.Richard P. Henry, Maryland's inspector general for education, acknowledged the possibility that officials in other school districts could be misusing the school contracting system.\"You know, we don't find out all the time, but there will always be some individuals who will take advantage of flaws in the system, and you know, possibly profit from it or use it to their advantage,\" Henry said.County or district officials frequently audit local school districts in Maryland.On top of that, the state Office of Legislative Audits reviews the books of each school district once every six years, whereas the Maryland Office of the Inspector General for Education takes complaints from the public and investigates them.But audits, while helpful, can only identify problems. It is up to the districts to implement solutions - and often they don't. The Office of Legislative Audits released an audit of the Maryland State Department of Education in January. Auditors found 171 repeated findings that local school systems had yet to address from previous audits.Matthew Streett, assistant director of the Compliance and Performance Audit Division in the Office of Legislative Audits, said school districts should take audit findings seriously.\"I think it's important to safeguard the assets because ultimately, when you're talking about money that flows through the school system, it's all intended to help educate the students, and if money is being diverted, it's less money that's intended for the classroom and students,\" Streett said.Public school districts in Montgomery County, Baltimore City, Howard County, Charles County and Calvert County have all been audited in recent years. Concerns raised in those audits range from unauthorized transactions to insufficient documentation to justify major purchases.In addition, the audits found that nearly every school district failed to complete proper documentation for approval of intergovernmental purchasing agreements. In many cases, employees made purchases without documenting why they were necessary and beneficial to the district.Here's a detailed look at what auditors and investigators found in recent years in those individual school districts: MONTGOMERY COUNTYAuditors have found a number of issues with school district contracting in Montgomery County, but none more serious than the one that led to guilty pleas from two district transportation department officials this year.In May, Charles Ewald, the district's former assistant transportation director, pleaded guilty to one count of felony theft and one misdemeanor count of misconduct in office.Court records said Ewald used his position to request checks from an \"off-the-books\" account held by one of the district's longtime bus vendors, American Truck & Bus Inc. The money came from late fee and change fee reimbursements owed to the district - and, according to court documents, $352,568.68 of it went directly to Ewald's bank account. In addition, Ewald had the bus vendor issue about $16,000 in checks to other school district staff members.Todd Watkins, the former director of the transportation department, pleaded guilty in June to one count of misconduct in office, and not just because he failed to fulfill his role of overseeing the department's expenses. Watkins was the one who coordinated with American Truck & Bus to establish the \"offthe-books\" account, court records said.Watkins received more than $13,000 using the account and intentionally violated the district's reimbursement policy, but he provided documentation for those payments and was not charged with theft.A judge will sentence Ewald and Watkins in September, closing a criminal case that began with an internal review in 2021.Then last December, the Montgomery County Office of the Inspector General found that school district transportation department officials used school funds to pay for a NASCAR headset, drag racing tires, a sport loop band for an Apple Watch, a car roof rack for kayaks, Home Depot and Amazon gift cards, along with other personal items. The purchases totaled nearly $5,000.In response to the audit, Montgomery County Public Schools officials confirmed all the findings were factually accurate and outlined procedures they planned to implement to correct the problems.CALVERT COUNTYThe state Office of Legislative Audits reported in January 2022 that Calvert County Public Schools took shortcuts in the spending approval process and failed to monitor whether their vendors were billing them correctly.The lack of oversight on the district's financial systems allowed individual departments and schools to make purchases while skipping necessary procurement processes, auditors said.Auditors raised questions about the district's transportation costs. Compared to other comparable-sized districts, Calvert County schools paid 22 cents per mile more for transportation.In addition, the district paid over a half-million dollars in bus operations fees without providing any reasonable justification for these transportation costs.On other contracts, the district didn't check to see if the price written on the invoice from vendors matched the pricing agreed to in the contract. The audit found five payments in intergovernmental contract agreements that added up to $642,000 that were vaguely detailed or had different product descriptions.Calvert County Public Schools accepted the audit results and said it would address the issues. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nBuses prepare for departure from Easton Elementary after the first day of school in 2022. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Commission president: 'I'm on the fence with this' - Breeding balks at Caroline's share of $94M building replacement\n\n September 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: A2 | Section: News \n \n 917\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - With Caroline County's other spending priorities on the front burner, Chesapeake College's $79 million funding request to the five Mid-Shore counties to construct a new technology center was met with hesitation by the Caroline County Commissioners at their Sept. 19 meeting.But the deadline is quickly approaching to make a decision about an over $3.8 million request the county is being asked to fund as its share for a new - and the commissioners agree is necessary - technology building.A virtual meeting was held Sept. 18 between leaders of the college and of the five counties that support the community college in Wye Mills.Earlier in the month, Chesapeake College President Clifford Coppersmith made his case to the Caroline County Commission in Denton.The \"renovation project for the Queen Anne's Technical Center is well past its due date for either a heavy renovation or absolute replacement,\" Coppersmith said on Sept. 5.He asked for \"statements of support or letters of intent from each of (the) support counties.\" Those letters are due before Sept. 28. The project has been submitted to the Maryland State Department of Budget and Management, which will consider it, along with a list of other state projects, on Sept. 28.At their Sept. 19 meeting, the Caroline County Commissioners agreed to draft a letter of intent to support the project, as long as the intention is specifically worded as non-binding.The programs housed in the 2-story, 90,000 square-foot building will include electrical, welding, HVAC, culinary and marine and construction trades training.The state will pay for 75% of the project, with the remaining 25% to be funded by the five counties, and the percentages determined by each county's population. The state's contribution would be just over $59 million.At both the Sept. 5 and Sept. 19 meetings, Commission Vice President Larry Porter supported funding the project, but expressed concern about future unknown costs associated with the 2021 Blueprint for Maryland's Future.Also at the Sept. 5 meeting, Commissioner Frank Bartz supported the project. \"I support this, but Kirwan's going to be the big challenge down the road, but I think our community needs this. I think our young adults need this to offer them more opportunity.\" Kirwan is a nickname for the Blueprint.\"I really do, very seriously, understand the financial impact that this project will have on the region we serve,\" Coppersmith said on Sept. 5.As of Sept. 18, Talbot and Queen Anne's counties agreed to help finance the project. However, Dorchester County declined, and Kent and Caroline had not announced their decisions. A simple majority of counties is needed to approve funding the project.Caroline could join the Queen Anne's County's bond, but the county's interest on the bond over 20 years would increase the final cost to over $6 million.\"And that is on top of the HPAC (Health Professions and Athletics Center) building that we currently pay approximately $110,000 on, so that will put our payment for facilities at $420,000, roughly, until 2034 when the HPAC drops off,\" said Caroline County Finance Director Daniel Fox.Commission President Travis Breeding was not fully convinced at yesterday's meeting. \"This just kind of popped up two weeks ago,\" he said.\"I agree with the consensus of everyone on the call that the building is needed,\" Breeding said. \"But I'm not sure yet how it falls into my priority list. One of my major concerns is and I want to get a few more answers from the college before I vote on it.\" Breeding said he wanted to know \"is how much our local Career and Technology Education Program will be able to utilize the facility during the day.\" \"I am concerned that we have Federalsburg Elementary School, and part of that school was constructed in the 1930s,\" he said. \"We have Lockerman Middle School, Denton Elementary School (and) Ridgely Elementary, all constructed in the 70s as well, and we have a CCTC building at North Caroline High that was constructed in the 1960s. Not to mention, we have a detention center build looming on the horizon, whether we see this regional agreement through.\" \"So, I'm concerned with our ability to take on this much debt,\" Breeding said. \"I don't want to hamstring future boards with a $312,000 payment for the next 20 years, because that will be a line item that they will have no control over, and they will be forced to fund. And I'm concerned about Blueprint. I'm on the fence with this, and I'm going to do a lot more research into next week.\" Porter said he didn't support the HPAC building project, but he supports the new technology center build. \"I think while this opportunity is available, we should utilize it,\" he said. \"If these students are successful in receiving this training and these certifications, they would be able to stay in this county and not have to go somewhere else.\" Porter said he believed, based on Fox's figures, the county \"would be in a position where we would not have to borrow the entire amount.\" \"I'm also cautiously optimistic about the ability of Del. Ghrist to get some Blueprint credit for this,\" Porter said. \"I'm not counting on it, not because I don't think he can't do it - I just don't count on things that are not concrete.\" The commission will make a final decision at its 9 a.m. meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 26, in Room 106, 109 Market St., Denton. \n \n Caption: SCREENSHOT\n \nThe Caroline County Commissioners hosted a presentation by Chesapeake College President Clifford Coppersmith Sept. 5.

    "content": "'Fantastic job this summer' - Summer school program to expand next year\n\n September 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 15 | Section: News \n \n 919\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - Based on the success of the 2023 summer education program and continued grant funding, Caroline County Public Schools' leaders are aiming to teach 400 more students next year.Presenting statistics and anecdotal comments about the program at the Sept. 5 meeting of the Board of Education, Lindsey McCormick, director of College and Career Readiness, gave \"huge shout-outs and kudos\" to the 75 certified teachers, 15 instructional assistants and seven site coordinators who \"chose to give up portions of their summer and continue to work with our students.\" Instructional assistants also received additional training this year.Caroline County School Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons praised McCormick's leadership.\"Lindsey has done a fantastic job.Her team has done a fantastic job this summer, he said. \"This (report) is an absolute testament to that.\"McCormick said 100 Caroline County Recreation and Parks staff helped with the 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. elementary summer camp called Jurassic Jamboree, which attracted 50 more students this year than in 2022.\"They're a tremendous partner,\" she said.The summer lessons and activities were designed for elementary, middle and high school students, with special programs for students with disabilities and multilingual learners.McCormick said the five-week time frame for summer programming was essentially the same as last year's, running from June 23 to July 27. Altogether, 916 students participated.Elementary students numbered 747 and attended sessions at four elementary schools (Federalsburg was closed for renovations). The average attendance was 14 days of the 19-day program.Participating in the elementary programming were 70 multilingual learners, 49 of whom attend Greensboro Elementary School.In the morning, students participated in both Reading Eggs and Moving with Math or Agile Mind; the Agile Mind math program was introduced for fifth grade students. When the teachers left, students had lunch, and in the afternoon, Recreation and Parks staff led enrichment activities.Secondary students attended only morning sessions. McCormick said one of the goals was to \"boost our middle school program.\"\"We raised our numbers to 40 students, and I was thrilled with that,\" she said. She praised after-school coordinator Deja Thompson for implementing what McCormick envisioned.\"Our middle school students had 45 minutes a day where they could rotate through, by choice, some CTE (Career and Technology Education) mini-sessions,\" McCormick said, adding that \"one of the large pushes\" in the Blueprint For Maryland's Future is more career exploration starting in middle school through high school.McCormick added comments from both teachers and parents to her PowerPoint presentation. One parent noted, \"My seventh grade son didn't want to 'give up' his summer but over the course of five weeks, he only missed three days. He was extremely excited about the CCTC programs he was able to see.\"\"I thought it was just great that our students had the opportunity to be exposed to some of our different CTE programs,\" she said. \"The CTE teachers themselves came to the middle schools to do that.\"Middle school students attended a tri-county, career enrichment day in Dorchester County that McCormick called \"amazing.\"Simmons explained the that Dorchester program is funded by the Mid-Shore Regional Council and is led by People for Change, \"an organization out of Prince George's County of largely minority business owners and professionals who run STEM sessions.\"High school students were offered summer \"credit recovery\" courses, and 131 participated and passed the courses, 92 from North Caroline and 39 from Colonel Richardson.\"It was less students this year, which you could say is a good thing because if you are doing credit recovery, you want less students,\" McCormick said. Students can take credit recovery courses during the school year, as well as repeat courses to earn credits needed for graduation.The program for students with disabilities from elementary through high school increased by 30, with 127 students participating, 102 at the elementary level, and 25 secondary students.CCPS Food Service provided breakfast and lunch for all students, as well as lunch for elementary students, or nearly 15,000 meals. Health rooms were staffed with nurses and health assistants, and School Based Wellness Centers were open.McCormick expects next year's program to be the same duration.\"Nineteen days is amazing.It's not too short, and it's not too long,\" she said.Because some classrooms had waitlists, McCormick said her \"goal is to increase summer programming by 400 students, so I have to have about 1,200 to 1,300 students next summer.\"A 21st Century Grant is pending to help fund the program.This year's program was funded by the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) Fund, food services and in-kind in use of buildings, according to CCPS Communications Officer Sandi Barry.\"We have this funding for one more year, and we want to make sure we maximize it.,\" Simmons said. \"We will continue to look for grant opportunities working with our partners, with Recreation Parks, with the YMCA, if possible.\"\"We will continue working with our partners, but we're going to maximize everything we can to make it make it work, make it sustainable, and then have the great data to then go to the grant sources to keep the funding coming in,\" Simmons said. \n \n Caption: A big bounce house and slippery slide cool off Preston Elementary School students who attend the 19-day summer program.\n \nA little game of checkers is a great way to connect during summer camp at Greensboro Elementary School.\n \nLindsey McCormick, CCPS director of College and Career Readiness, presents results of the Summer School program.\n \nThese two friendly Greensboro Elementary School Hornets are not in a stinging mood during summer camp. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Counties Sue Social Media Over Mental Health in Schools - Talbot Among 10 Counties Claiming Classroom Distraction",

    "content": "Counties sue social media over mental health in schools - Talbot among 10 counties claiming classroom distraction\n\n October 5, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Christina Walker; Capital News Service | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1088\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A \"boring and pointless\" education.That's what students at Henry E. Lackey High School in Indian Head, in Charles County, tell their English teacher Nicholas Gray they're receiving while they distract themselves with TikTok videos, \"snaps\" on Snapchat and endless scrolls through Instagram during class.\"It is difficult to convince [students] that learning is more impactful and important than the brand new video that will entertain them,\" Gray said.With that thought in mind, Charles County this month joined nine other Maryland school districts in a lawsuit against the world's social media giants: Google, Meta, ByteDance and Snap Inc. Other school districts in the state that have joined the court action are Anne Arundel, Baltimore City, Carroll, Cecil, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George's and Talbot.\"Hopefully this lawsuit provides pressure for some action in terms of how to better create products that are geared to children,\" said Maria Navarro, superintendent of Charles County Public Schools.CLASSROOM DISTRACTIONThe lawsuit accused several social media platforms of targeting and manipulating youth so they stay engaged for excessive amounts of time - and that's exactly what educators see in Charles County classrooms.\"(Social media is) a huge distraction in our schools and in our classrooms,\" said Cheryl Davis, principal of Henry E. Lackey High School.The teachers do their part to plan effective, instructional uses for technology in the classroom, Davis said, but personal devices get in the way.Gray said he prohibits the use of cell phones during instructional times and tries to create engaging lessons so that students will not be tempted to use their devices or go on social media.However, he said, the biggest problem plaguing his students is self control and their failure to regulate personal behavior.\"Students are lacking the ability to express their emotions in a positive way,\" Davis said. \"We see a lot more negative expressions.\"Students have gotten more angry and aggressive, Davis said. In a developmental part of their lives, they often fail to pause for a moment and look for resources or constructive ways to express their emotions.\"There is no respite,\" Gray said. \"Students leave for the day and the talking/anger continues onto Instagram or Snapchat, and then the students come to school upset over what is on social media.\"Several Charles County educators said more physical altercations have occurred because of social media conflicts.\"Snapchat scares me,\" said Brian Street, a father of two Piccowaxen middle schoolers.\"I've seen several fights at school on Snapchat.\"On top of that, two staff members at St. Charles High School were injured Thursday after they intervened in a physical altercation between students that started over a social media post, according to a letter that Principal Tammika Little sent out to parents.\"Please monitor your child's electronic devices and social media accounts,\" Little said.MENTAL HEALTHNot surprisingly, school officials in Charles County and elsewhere are alarmed at how social media affects child development and mental health. That concern is also reflected in the lawsuit, which alleges that companies are aware of the negative impacts the platforms have on children's mental health, but they choose to prioritize profit.Students go through developmental changes from elementary school to middle school, where their focus shifts from their parents to their peer group. Navarro said this is when children start pushing their own boundaries and understanding how to become an adult.As students become more self-sufficient, they begin building confidence - but social media usage during this stage can interrupt a child's growth, Navarro said.\"A fake reality, at those pivotal developmental ages, has more of an impact on behavioral health,\" Navarro said. \"It also isolates you.\"Navarro said social media augments the insecurities children face at pivotal ages, and research seems to prove that point. Researchers at Facebook found that Instagram, in 2021, made one in three girls feel worse about their bodies, according to the Wall Street Journal.Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic further isolated children and left many in a more fragile mental state.According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2021, suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 14.Charles County educators said social media contributes to the mental health crises that some young people endure. Inappropriate social media interactions continue to create disruptions in the buildings all over the county because children these ages are not developmentally ready for the responsibility, Davis said.\"Students lack the maturity to be able to handle social media,\" Davis said.That being the case, Davis said schools must make mental health a priority or else their true purpose will not be achieved.\"We are here to educate students,\" Davis said. \"If students are not in the right mindset, then it's much more difficult for them to access education.\"Searching for solutions While voicing support for the lawsuit, Charles County educators are looking elsewhere for more prompt solutions to the problems social media causes in the classroom.Davis pushed for parents to be a part of the solution.\"You pay for the phone, you own the phone, put some apps on there that allow you to control access,\" Davis said.Parents should be monitoring their kids' devices to make sure they're safe, Davis said, and it is not just her who feels this way.\"It's not a school thing, it's a parent thing,\" Street said.He said that while he does monitor his kids' social media usage, it is a parents' decision on how active they want to be in controlling it.Navarro said Charles County Public Schools has many resources for parents to learn how to be tech savvy so they know how to keep their children safe. In addition to limiting screen time, she said parents should be encouraging their kids to physically play, talk and participate in sports and extracurricular activities with other kids.Navarro said when to allow children to have devices is a parent's choice.\"My job is to inform and educate them about the implications of those decisions,\" Navarro said. She said she wants students to reach their full potential, but right now social media makes it harder for them to do that.That's where the lawsuit could help.Navarro said that if the district gets any compensation from this lawsuit, the school system intends to expand resources for the growing needs of behavioral health.And even in these early stages, Navarro said, the lawsuit serves an important purpose.\"It sends a message,\" she said.The message: that everyone - from social media companies to educators to parents to students - must be alert to the harm that social media can do to young people. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Level one is a \"beginning learner,\" level two is a \"developing learner,\" and level four is a \"distinguished learner.\"Students who fall into levels 3 and 4 are considered proficient in the subject. In Dorchester County, the percent of students that fall into level 4 for the English language arts and math categories are between 0 and 5%.For the level three proficient learner category in English language arts, compared to Spring 2022 data:▪ Third graders increased to 31% from 26.4%.▪ Fourth graders increased to 32% from 27.6%.▪ Fifth graders increased to 33% from 26.8%▪ Sixth graders increased to 33% from 22.2% - a 10.8% increase.▪ Seventh graders decreased to 20% from 24.1%.▪ Eighth graders decreased to 27% from 29.2%.Along with seventh and eighth graders, there was a drop in the percent of proficient learners for the English 10 assessment compared to the previous year. The percentage dropped from 36.4% to 35%.Colman said the state average growth for English language arts was 2.9 percentage points.Dorchester County's average growth was 4.1 percentage points, she said.\"So we grew significantly, or doubled, the amount that the rest of the state did,\" she said. \"It put us at the eleventh spot [in the state] as far as growth is concerned.\"Laura Aberg, DCPS supervisor of reading and English language arts for K through 12, spoke after Colman presented on the English language arts data.\"I'm excited to see all the growth for our younger students,\" she said.\"Our secondary students, we need to do some work to get back to the levels of growth that we like to see.\"Aberg said the district has implemented more diagnostics at the beginning of the year to identify those \"reading gaps\" so they can be addressed sooner for secondary students. She also talked about getting ready to enroll students in grades six through eight, as well as tenth graders, in MCAP tutorials.Aberg said she hopes to see even greater growth for younger students in the future since the district has implemented a foundational reading program that aligns with the science of reading, or the research behind how students learn to read.Board Member Theresa Stafford asked Aberg what the district did differently last year that might be attributed to the growth in proficiency for elementary students.Aberg mentioned multiple changes including the use of DIBELS test data to \"help drive instruction\" and getting teachers trained in the science of reading.MATHWhen it came to MCAP math assessments, grade seven and Algebra I saw significant increases in proficiency. The percentage of seventh graders that were considered proficient learners increased to 11% from less than 5% the year before. The percentage of Algebra I students that were considered proficient learners increased to 10% from less than 5% the year before.For grade six, there was a decrease in proficient learners, compared the year before, from 10% to less than 5%.For the other math assessments in the county, there was a mix of slight increases, slight decreases and constants in the percentage of proficient learners compared to the previous year. These include:▪ Third graders decreased to 20% from 20.3%▪ Fourth graders increased to 15% from 14.6%▪ Fifth graders increased to 14% from 12.2%▪ Eighth graders stayed at less than 5%▪ Geometry students stayed at 0%▪ Algebra II students decreased to 0% from less than 5%Colman said that while the state average growth for math was 2.5 percentage points, Dorchester County grew 2.0 percentage points.DCPS is focusing on improving math scores for third graders, sixth graders and Algebra I students this year, she said.\"Those were kind of the focus areas as far as the data,\" Colman said.She said there is a focus on third grade because it is the first group of students to take the MCAP assessments and there is a need for those students to gain a better understanding of the assessment.At the middle school level, Colman said the math coach is working with teachers and modeling lessons. The math coach is also working and planning with Algebra I teachers.\"So she's kind of targeted certain grade levels to try to impact some of this data,\" Colman said.After Colman's presentation on the math data, Board Member Chris Wheedleton talked about the importance of recognizing the data, good and bad, and talking about how the data can be improved for next year.\"I'm really pleased to see what you all are doing with this, how you've organized it,\" he said. \"But then, it's really about the action.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wright will begin her service as state superintendent by Oct. 23, 2023, pending the completion of onboarding logistics.Most recently, Wright served for nine years as the state superintendent of schools in Mississippi.\"I am honored to be appointed to this position and am excited to work on behalf of the teachers, leaders and students of Maryland. Maryland is well-positioned to provide a world-class education system for all its students and to ensure each student's success,\" Wright said. \"I am confident that by establishing strong relationships and partnerships across the state we will witness strong, equitable educational outcomes for our students. I welcome the opportunity to be an active participant in this endeavor.\"Under Wright's leadership, Mississippi's Quality Counts grade for education improved from an F to a C, improving its ranking from 50th to 35th. Her work reform efforts to improve literacy instruction for children Pre-K through third grade produced significant improvements in literacy rates in Mississippi, with the largest gains in fourth grade literacy on the National Assessment for Educational Progress.\"I am thrilled to welcome Dr. Carey Wright as Maryland's Interim State Superintendent. She is an exceptional leader who will guide Maryland's education system into its new chapter,\" Gov. Wes Moore said. \"Dr. Wright brings exemplary expertise to this role and I am confident that she will be a dedicated leader committed to transparency, accountability, and partnership to improve education outcomes in every corner of Maryland, just as this state deserves.\"Wright has long been an enthusiastic advocate for early childhood education and in Mississippi implemented the first publicly funded Early Learning Collaborative program, which earned the state recognition from the National Institute for Early Education Research as one of only seven states in the nation that meet all or most quality standards for early childhood education.Wright brings to the position decades of service as a Maryland educator with stints in Prince George's, Howard, and Montgomery County Public Schools as a teacher, principal, director of special education, and associate superintendent. Prior to serving as superintendent in Mississippi, Wright served as the chief academic officer in DC Public Schools. Wright obtained her bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park.\"Dr. Wright is a Maryland educator and a national leader of education reform. She has the experience and expertise to lead Maryland through implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and through our state's commitment to educational equity and improving outcomes for all students,\" State Board President Clarence Crawford said. \"We are confident in her ability to lead our school system through this transition period, to be focused on transparency and accountability, and to continue building towards the improvements in results in our schools that we all know are necessary.\"Wright will receive a salary at an annual rate of $350,000, which will be prorated to the amount of time she serves from now through June 30, 2024. The joint State Board and MSDE Transition Team will support Wright as she is onboarded, and the national search for a permanent state superintendent of schools will continue in the coming months. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

TCPS Director of Operations Kevin Shafer said this submission is the next milestone in the design process.Before the board voted unanimously to submit the design development plan, Shafer and Adam McDonald, project manager and architect from design firm Hord Coplan Macht, gave a presentation to update the board on plans for the project, including the schedule and estimated project costs.McDonald explained that the project includes a full renovation of the existing building and 16,600 square feet of additions.Three total additions at different corners of the building will add additional learning space.\"The additions are also going to help us enhance the overall design of the building,\" McDonald said.Since the board's last update on project plans, McDonald said they have made changes to the addition on the north corner of the building to \"work better with the existing utilities\" during construction.A traffic pattern has been formalized, and a first submission has been made to the State Highway Administration to create an additional curb cut to separate the parent entry loop from the bus drop.\"To help alleviate some of the traffic concerns that come with a shared entrance,\" McDonald said.The design plans for outside also include an extension to the parking lot to provide more space for parents dropping off students.Inside the building, McDonald said that most spaces will remain in the same areas as they are pre-renovation.The main change, he said, is that the media center will move to the front of the building and the art classroom will take over where the current media center is.Currently, bidding for the project is expected to take place in April and May of 2024. Construction would begin in June of 2024 and is estimated to take about two years.The estimated cost of construction and site work is $25.18 million. State and county funding for this will come out of FY2025 and FY2026 budgets. With additional expenditures, for things like design costs, the project is expected to cost $29.97 million.Shafer said this estimated cost is $1 million less than the state projection for the project.\"So I feel like we're within where we want to be,\" he said, adding that this is still just a projection and the real numbers will come when they bid the project out.After the presentation, board members asked questions.Board Member Deborah Bridges asked about the plan for the school's roof.\"The slanted roofs really have me worried,\" she said, expressing concern about drainage.Shafer said the pitched roof is not near the courtyard.\"The architect will make sure that any kind of drainage that's coming off the roof, whether it's roof drain or exterior drain, is properly sized to accommodate that water shed,\" he said. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nAdam McDonald, project manager and architect from design firm Hord Coplan Macht, updates the Talbot County Board of Education on design plans for the Chapel District Elementary School renovation and addition project at a Board of Education meeting Oct. 18.\n \nCOURTESY OF TALBOT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS\n \nA rendering of what the front of Chapel District Elementary School would look like based on renovation and addition project plans. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Her first job in education was teaching at a middle school.Now, Howie is the curriculum supervisor of career and technical education for Dorchester County Public Schools as well as the interim principal at Mace's Lane Middle School.Monday, she was sworn in to the Board of Education after being appointed to the District 5 seat by Gov. Wes Moore. The appointment comes after the resignation of Susan Delean-Botkin, the previous District 5 board member.W hen she learned of the appointment, Howie told her husband first. He was so excited he switched a flight he had for a conference so he could watch her get sworn in on Monday.Howie herself was excited and honored.\"A little scared at the same time, because this is a huge undertaking and it's extremely important,\" she said.Howie talked about the importance of being able to support students' social and emotional and mental health, especially after COVID-19.\"Schools are safe places for a lot of our students,\" she said. \"If I'm hungry, if I'm angry, if I don't know where I'm going to go to sleep tonight, I can't learn.\" Social and emotional learning is one of the Board's priorities this school year. Its other priorities are increasing academic achievement and teacher retention.\"There are teacher shortages everywhere right now, and it's so important that we retain the teachers,\" she said.\"Because when you have to continually hire new teachers, there is that onboarding process and there is that learning curve.\" Joining the board, Howie is continuing her mother and grandfather's legacy in Talbot County Public Schools.When Howie was 18, her mother died from breast cancer. She remembers the funeral being \"packed\" with former students and teachers from the district.\"There are teachers in this school district that knew my mom when she was here and they come up to me all the time and they're like, 'Your mother would be so proud,'\" Howie said, tearing up.With two meetings under her belt so far - a work session on Monday and a regular meeting on Wednesday - Howie is feeling welcomed by her fellow board members.She appreciates the organization of the meetings.\"Everything went very smooth,\" she said.Although she's been on the board for less than a week, Howie has already been thinking about whether she will run for the position when her seat is up next year. She doesn't have an answer yet, though.\"I have definitely, definitely put a lot of thought into that,\" she said. \"This is such a wonderful opportunity.\" \n \n Caption: ANNA HOWIE \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Education foundation established in Caroline - Four local leaders spearhead funding financial literacy opportunities for students\n\n November 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 1A | Section: News \n \n 933\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - \"Now we truly do have an education foundation in Caroline County, which is wonderful,\" Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons said at the Board of Education's Nov. 7 meeting.The announcement followed several months of work by four community leaders to establish the Caroline County Education Foundation, which was launched on Oct. 5.Tolbert Rowe, Robert Willey, Dr. James Orr Jr. and Wayne Cole spearheaded the effort.With the Blueprint for Maryland Education's unfunded mandate, school districts statewide are exploring funding streams beyond the traditional tax base.Other Mid-Shore counties with established education foundations are Kent and Talbot.\"The Caroline County Public Schools Education Foundation Fund is a subfund through the Mid-Shore Community Foundation,\" said Rowe, vice president of Bay Capital Mortgage based in Annapolis.\"Most importantly, I think it's a landing place that we can find philanthropic individuals and organizations we can solicit.\" A previous foundation was established in 1987, according to Willey, a Denton certified public accountant who took part in its inception.\"It was set up on a mini-grant system,\" Willey said. \"The grants weren't supposed to be any more than $500, and they were to be awarded directly to classroom teachers to try to do projects that could not be funded through the school board's budget.\" \"We started off great guns, and we operated for around 10 years, and then the board just got tired,\" Willey said. \"We weren't able to recruit new blood and people with more energy and it just kind of died in the mid-90s.\" However, just over $8,000 remains in bank account once managed by the former foundation, an account which Willey still oversees.In a Nov. 18 interview, he said the new foundation will preserve the intent of the previous foundation's donors.\"Basically, it's the seed money that went into the educational fund that we've created with Mid-Shore Community Foundation,\" Rowe said in a Nov. 16 interview.During a conversation about Junior Achievement - a nonprofit providing financial literacy, work readiness and entrepreneurship education to K-12 students - Willey and Rowe decided it was time to reconstitute an education foundation with the Mid-Shore Community Foundation, of which Rowe is a director.\"We're focusing our efforts initially with financial literacy, career exploration (and) anything that will enhance children,\" Rowe said at the Nov. 7 meeting. \"Much as Junior Achievement does, it's a shotgun approach. We want every kid to experience these things that will help them to make prudent economic career decisions.\" Orr said the group of four is currently working on bylaws. The purpose of the foundation \"shall be to enhance, inspire and support educational opportunities in the area of financial literacy for all students attending Caroline County public schools,\" he said.On Nov. 16, Rowe said, \"The four of us decided that, at least at this point, it would be more impactful to focus our efforts on a specific area like financial literacy, as opposed to everything, because we just don't have a lot of money.If we get more money, then we can expand the mission, but for right now we're going to hold pat with financial literacy.\" Rowe said the founders \"will be setting up a meeting soon get our bylaws adopted and make decisions as to who could serve with us.If anyone knows of anyone in the community that would be good for this organization, we would love to have a conversation.\" \"Times are changing, and this financial literacy piece is going to become so important and we're going to grow this fund,\" said Cole, chief financial officer of WIN Transport, Inc. in Federalsburg.\"Financial literacy obviously is very powerful,\" Simmons said.\"Caroline County is still one of the only systems in the state that requires all of our high schoolers to complete a full credit of a finance course before graduation, and I'm glad we have that, but at the same time, one only has to look at the current economic situation we're in to realize that one credit during your high school experience in one county on Maryland's Eastern Shore is not solving a fiscal issue that's in front of us everywhere.But financial literacy is a massive undertaking and needed.\" Simmons explained that CCPS was the first to sign a memorandum of understanding with Junior Achievement of the Eastern Shore regarding providing students opportunities at the organization's 25,000 square-foot regional facility under construction in Salisbury.\"It's a great center, but it's also a great program that they put together, working with businesses and communities across the Eastern Shore (and it's) great, strong curriculum coming in,\" Simmons said. The curriculum aligns with the Maryland State Department of Education's requirements.He said the foundation would be in a good position to help with costs associated with students getting to the facility.\"We are the furthest distance from the center and we have the highest degree of poverty,\" Simmons said. \"We're the (school) system that has the most need with the least amount of funds to spend to get our kids there, and we have the greatest distance to drive to get there.\" He added that the Blueprint, which requires career exploration as well as dual enrollment, also requires counties to fund compliance with the legislation.\"We're required to pay for everybody's dual enrollment who are enrolled in our high schools,\" Simmons said. \"The math in Blueprint doesn't add up. They did not take financial literacy.\" \"That's where Blueprint stands right now, and we'll do our part,\" he said. He added that the foundation could \"help support other things that we're trying to do.\" \n \n Caption: SCREENSHOT\n \nDenton businessmen Bob Willey, at the lectern, and Tolbert Rowe on Nov. 7 explain how the Caroline County Education Foundation will fund financial literacy efforts for students. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hale and the class were excited to make this idea a reality.Since then, AMP cabinets with dartboard with darts included have been one of AMP's most popular products, selling out even before they were presented.Each time AMP students manufacture a product, they follow the same template.It begins with research, mood-boarding and a product pitch. With dartboards, students research the history, rules and professional leagues in the game of darts. Then each student must come up with a design for the project, followed by drafting their design and placing it on a Mood Board.This Mood Board becomes a visual they can refer to as they present their product pitch.Business partners, school officials, parents and former students are then invited to watch the students' product pitches Oct. 26.One by one, students manage the difficult task of individually pitching the details and merits of their designs to the class and guests in attendance.At the end of the presentations, everyone votes and a design is chosen.The next step in the process is called \"napkin sketching,\" which is a sketch of the product views and dimensions.These sketches are then taken to the computer aided drafting lab, where more accurate prints are made. From those prints, numeric commands are created that will drive a computer numeric control machine, which is a robot programmed to cut pieces out of stock material.Once complete, an audience is once again assembled for student presentations of the finished products, which are also offered for sale. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF CCPS\n \nAdvanced Manufacturing Program students at Caroline Career and Technology Center presented design ideas for their current project, a dartboard cabinet, on Oct. 26.

From military and law enforcement to county government and local businesses who are needing workers with specific skills, all were on hand to answer questions and discuss options for the future.One of the presenters was Connie Dean, the Career Technology Liaison for the Queen Anne's County Economic & Tourism Development department. Dean is assisting the two schools with finding businesses who are interested in the apprenticeship program.\"Students are first given skills that would be required to work in a certain business field,\" said Dean. Then the students work 450 hours at a partnering business to earn their official apprenticeship recognition.\"I try to tell businesses internships are a bigger commitment, when the apprenticeship program would be appropriate for future workers in their field,\" she said.Currently, there are three Kent Island students who were trained in the culinary department at Chesapeake College this semester.Aly Swann said she learned about the basics like cutting meat, how to work with knives and other kitchen tools, and how to make sauces. \"I know now 100% that this is what I want to do for a living,\" she said.James Smith said the school was really helpful in letting him work some during the school day. \"I appreciate that I got a pathway for my career. I have learned skills I will use for a long time,\" said Smith.Last Tuesday, was military and law enforcement day for the Queen Anne's apprentice week, with recruiters from all armed forces branches, answering questions about basic training, money for college, and traveling the globe.Troopers Christopher Bekefiand Doug Prince provided information on the Maryland State Police Cadet program, where students aged 17-19 are assigned to perform duties that do not require police authority (example helping with crowds at large public events). Cadets are also assigned to work under the supervision of a Trooper at a truck inspection station or on patrol.They also have an explorer program for students aged 14-18, where they are introduced to various divisions and tactics like crime scene investigations, traffic stops, and forensics.Adam Tolley, supervisor of Career and Technology Education for Queen Anne's Public Schools, was pleased to see so many students engaging with a variety of workforce representatives. \"This is a very organized way to provide students who are beginning to think about real career options,\" he said.County Commissioner Philip Dumenil was present to view the new apprentice week program first hand at Queen Anne's High School. \"I like new opportunities for exposure to these kind of programs,\" said Dumenil. \"Lots of money can still be made in the trade fields. Not every kid wants to go to college.\" Queen Anne's student Austin Hahn, just a sophomore, has already chosen a career for his future, and that, said Ricketts, makes him a perfect apprentice candidate.Hahn has chosen to pursue a career in marine mechanics and pipe welding and wishes to move to the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana or Texas where he has family. \"My grandfather taught me a lot about it,\" said Hahn. \"He said it would be the best money I could ever make. When he passed away, I knew I would definitely do it.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nNew Career Coach Betsy Ricketts stands beside the poster for Queen Anne's County High School's first apprenticeship week schedule. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "MCAP results show signs of recovery from pandemic learning loss - Science scores still show decline\n\n November 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Aya Hussein; Capital News Service | Page: 27 | Section: News \n \n 840\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n COLLEGE PARK - The results for the 2023 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program tests for grades 3 to 8 show that student proficiency in English Language Arts has surpassed the level it was at before the pandemic.Math scores have improved, but have yet to fully rebound from the pandemic, while science scores have declined, according to the Maryland State Department of Education.MCAP tests are administered annually in public schools to assist educators in understanding student progression so that they can better tailor their methods of instruction, according to MSDE.Students in grades 3 to 8 take tests in English and math, while students in grades 5 and 8 are given an additional science test.ENGLISH PROFICIENCY SURPASSES 2019According to data from MSDE, average English proficiency dropped from 44% in 2019 to 31% in 2021.Proficiency increased significantly in 2022 and by a smaller degree in 2023, with results showing an average passing rate of 47%, according to MSDE.Improvements can be seen across Maryland, as every county except Somerset had an increase in English proficiency between 2022 and 2023.MATH PROFICIENCY STILL BELOW PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELSThe 24% average passing rate for math in 2023 is still lower than the 31% in 2019, indicating that math scores have still not fully recovered from pandemic learning loss.Despite average passing rates in math still not being as high as in 2019, they have gone up since dropping to 15% in 2021. Proficiency increased by 6 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and 3 percentage points from 2022 to 2023.Not every county had an improvement, as there are four counties that saw a decline in average math proficiency from 2022 to 2023: Baltimore, Kent, Somerset and Talbot.Baltimore County Public Schools Board of Education Member at Large Tiara Booker-Dwyer said that an explanation for the slower improvement in math scores is that the format of math questions in these tests have become more layered, which makes it difficult for parents, teachers and administrators trained in the traditional format to help students get accustomed.HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED STUDENTS LAG BEHINDDespite making improvements over the last two years, average scores for historically underserved students in English and math still lag behind. The most recent scores of Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino and American Indian/Alaska Native students are still below those of white and Asian students.Booker-Dwyer said that it is important to build the cultural competency of educators so that they can connect better with students.\"When you look at the curriculum that was developed, it speaks to a certain demographic.There are certain people who just 'I'm not going to connect with this,' so it's going to go in one ear and out the other. Or when they try to connect to it, people recognize that it's inauthentic,\" Booker-Dwyer said.Booker-Dwyer states that another solution is encouraging more historically underserved students to take honors and AP classes, as well as providing resources to schools to give them these opportunities.\"What the research shows is that if you're placed in an advanced academic class or gifted class, even if you're earning C's in there, you're better off long term than if you're just in the standard class,\" Booker-Dwyer said.\"Sometimes it's just exposure to certain things, just being in a classroom, around students who are performing at a certain level will kind of unintentionally make you perform at a higher level,\" she said.GRADE 8 SCIENCE PROFICIENCY HITS FIVEYEAR LOWScience scores continue to lag, especially for grade 8.In grade 5, science proficiency in the last five years peaked in 2021 at 41%, a 12-percentage point increase from 2019. In 2022, the passing rate dropped to 31% before rising again to 35% in 2023, according to MSDE.Grade 8 scores have been on a steady decline since 2021, with the passing rate dropping from 35% in 2022 to 26% in 2023, the lowest it's been in the last five years.With the exception of Dorchester, every county had at least a 10% decline in grade 8 science proficiency from 2022 to 2023. Six counties had over a 30% decrease from 2022: Kent, Charles, Prince George's, Washington, Allegany and Queen Anne's.MSDE states that this decline is likely due to the grade 8 students being in grade 6 during the 2020-2021 school year, which was predominantly online. As a result, students missed key science instruction during their first year of middle school.\"The results on the grade 8 assessment make clear the impact of grade 6 and 7 disruptions on a cumulative grade 8 assessment,\" MSDE said in the press release.Booker-Dwyer stated that rollout for the new Next Generation Science Standards for K-12 education, which has lessons in engineering, technology, earth and space sciences in addition to traditional sciences, was delayed by the pandemic.She remains optimistic that scores will improve as curriculum continues to change.\"I do believe it will get better as people are getting more and more comfortable with the science standards and more teachers are getting trained and the resources are getting better, as far as the instructional material,\" Booker-Dwyer said. \"But initially it was tough.\" The 2024 MCAP tests are set to begin in the spring. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Kirwan, chancellor emeritus of the University System of Maryland.By 2019, the Kirwan Commission had come to some sobering conclusions about Maryland's education system.Half of all teachers leave the profession within the first five years. Only two out of every five kindergarteners arrive in the classroom ready to learn. And just a third of students leave high school being \"college and career ready\" in English and math.\"That was pre-pandemic.So generally speaking, it's gotten worse,\" said Rachel Hise, a policy specialist who worked for the state in tandem with the Kirwan Commission.Explaining the commission's findings to school leaders in Ocean City, she said the independent body concluded that \"ultimately, the status quo is unsustainable.\"The Maryland General Assembly passed the Blueprint for Maryland's Future in February 2021, overriding a veto by then-Gov.Larry Hogan, a Republican who had cost concerns about the plan.The Blueprint allocates $3.8 billion to schools over the next 10 years.Hise is now executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board. She said the policy changes will make sure students are ready to learn in kindergarten and ready to succeed when they graduate high school.Because public schools lack the capacity to fulfill this mandate alone, the state will fund programming via private pre-K providers as well.\"The goal is a socioeconomically integrated pre-K system that is publicly funded, but that is provided by both public schools and private providers,\" Hise told administrators in Ocean City.The Blueprint will also mean big changes in high schools.\"What the Blueprint really envisions is we want kids to be college and career ready by 10th grade, so that the second two years of high school students can focus on the pathway that they're interested in pursuing,\" Hise said.The Blueprint aims to meet this goal through curriculum changes in English and math in addition to apprenticeships and technical education programs.Implementing the Blueprint at the school level falls squarely on school administrators, said Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\"There was no doubt that the Blueprint would be a part of this conference, and the understanding of the Blueprint is actually key,\" she said in an interview.After learning more about the Blueprint at the conference, some principals said they are hopeful that the reforms will address their schools' priorities.Teachers are struggling to make do with salaries in the current economy, said Principal Ryan Daniel of Fort Foote Elementary in Prince George's County.\"I know a lot of my teachers have to have after-school jobs or second jobs to compensate for their salary,\" she said.The Blueprint will raise the minimum salary for teachers to $60,000 across the state by 2026. And if teachers obtain National Board Certification, the Blueprint allows them to earn up to an additional $17,000 per year.Other schools have yet to feel the concrete impact of the Blueprint.\"Honestly, I'm still reading and learning, and I think that they're doing a really slow roll out intentionally for us, which is good,\" said Jamie Miller, the principal at Broadneck Elementary in Arnold. \"We have people at the board level who are becoming sort of experts and then they're going to disseminate to us.\"Miller expressed a mix of excitement about the expansion of pre-K and trepidation about her school's capacity to meet the need.In March 2023, every school district submitted a detailed plan to the Accountability and Implementation Board for rolling out the Blueprint in their schools.\"The plans are fine, but they really are a baseline,\" Hise said. \"There's a need for more innovative thinking.\"The Accountability and Implementation Board expects updated plans from every district in March 2024, and has offered every district a $100,000 grant to hire a strategic planning expert. All but Frederick and Worcester counties took the state up on that deal. \n \n Caption: Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board, presents on Maryland's plan to improve early childhood education. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Superintendent Outlines Budget Priorities, Timeline\n\n December 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; Cconnolly@Chespub.Com | Page: 15 | Section: News \n \n 785\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - The conundrum of uncertain Blueprint demands coupled with a projected decrease in pandemic-related grant funding for Caroline County Public Schools is proving to be a challenge for Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons, school administrators and district staff as they build a budget for fiscal year 2025.And because the dilemma impacts the traditional budgeting timeline employed in previous years, at the Dec. 5 meeting of the Caroline County Board of Education, the Superintendent Simmons received more time to develop a more realistic budget.\nThe Board of Education approved Simmons's request to revise the traditional timeline and move his final budget proposal from February to April.\n\"We do not have a good idea of what state revenues look like until the General Assembly gets done doing their work, which is April,\" Simmons said.\nWhile some demands of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a set of policies and spending for education in the state's public schools, are clear, others are still being modified. The \"uncertainties\" of the unfunded legislative mandate have created budgetary challenges for school administrators across the state.\nOne of the demands for school districts is funding dual enrollment for high school students who wish to take college courses. Blueprint's College and Career Readiness standards require school districts to pay for any student who meets the minimum requirements for dual enrollment. At roughly $1,000 per student per semester, CCPS spent $130,000 in 2023 for juniors and seniors to take courses at Chesapeake College. While \"it's great for the kids,\" Simmons said, the Blueprint requirement presents a budget challenge.\nAnother \"cost of doing Blueprint business\" is meeting the mandated starting teacher salary of $60,000 by fiscal year 2027.\nGrant funding \"is kind of how Caroline County has survived,\" Simmons said.\nBut some of that funding will decrease or cease altogether in 2024.\nBoth American Rescue Plan and Maryland Leads grant funding will sunset in Sept. 2024. In addition, the funding formula for Blueprint shows a 1.7% increase in state funding from last year, the lowest per year increase in the formula, Simmons said.\nThe CCPS budget, typical of school systems across the state is 80% people, Simmons said.\n\"The rule of thumb is anywhere between 80% to 90% of your budget is people, and when you take people out and you take out paying for your electric and your fuel and heating your buildings and running your buses and those sorts of things, you're probably left with somewhere between the neighborhood of 5% to 7% every year that truly is discretionary,\" Simmons said.\nAnd while \"about 14% of our money comes from the county government, the rest of it comes from state and federal, which is also why those numbers are important,\" he said.\nMost categories in Blueprint require financing at the school level, adding additional elements of complexity and compliance, and requiring full time accounting level position, Simmons said.\nBesides Blueprint's requirements, budget pressures also include the rate of inflation at over 3.5%, multiyear contracts that will come up for renewal in 2024 that will likely be higher than the rate of inflation and global issues impacting the cost of goods, including fuel.\nHowever, the budgeting challenge is not \"all doom and gloom,\" Simmons said.\nCaroline County has schools that qualify for \"concentration of poverty\" grant funding. While the funding is restricted to individual schools and can't support programs or positions at the district level, it helps take some pressure off the district to fund, for example, an afterschool program or reading intervention at a specific school.\nFederalsburg and Greensboro elementary schools already qualify; Colonel Richardson Middle School received its first concentration of poverty grant in 2023.\n\"It's likely we will see multiple other schools added as the Free and Reduced Meals rates maintain or increase,\" Simmons said. Because the concentration of poverty funding formula relies on Free and Reduced Meals data, Simmons said, \"I feel very confident all nine of our schools will get there.\"\nAs for the budgeting process, Simmons and his team will continue to work on the budget, try to find funding sources and work with the County finance office into 2024. Negotiating with the teachers' association will play a role, as well as a joint budget meeting with the Caroline County Commissioners.\n\"We also have a very good working relationship with the county commissioners,\" Simmons said. \"We are not one of those counties that walks over to the county commissioners and drops an additional increase of $3, 4 or 5 million on them.\" The final CCPS budget is due to the county commissioners by the end of June.\nPriorities in the fiscal year 2025 CCPS budget are competitive salaries and benefits for all employees, maintaining reasonable staffing levels across the district, maintaining high yield positions and programs that were included in pandemic-related grants and implementing the Blueprint as required. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Com | Page: 2 | Section: News \n \n 937\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - At a Talbot County Board of Education meeting Wednesday, administrators gave an update on the school system's priorities.Talbot County Public Schools' three priorities, identified in the spring, are academic equity and achievement, fostering an engaging environment and hiring and retaining highly qualified and diverse staff.\nSince sharing the priorities with the entire school system in August, Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said they have been working to \"infuse\" the priorities everywhere.\n\"In my roundtables, out in the community, in schools,\" she said. \"We're constantly talking about those three priorities.\"\nAt the meeting, strategies and metrics associated with each priority were shared.\nACADEMIC EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT When it comes to academic equity and achievement, TCPS has six strategies, including implementing additional interventions for students in and outside the classroom, hiring additional math coaches and implementing more assessments to measure growth.\nAssistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction Helga Einhorn said that since improving math was identified as a priority by the board, the district has added the NWEA MAP Growth Assessment for mathematics.\n\"Prior to this year, we did not have a standardized assessment that would allow us to collect this type of data as we had with reading,\" Einhorn said. \"We felt it was important, if we were going to make changes throughout the year, to progress monitor our students throughout the year.\"\nStudents in kindergarten through fifth grade took the beginning of the year MAP Growth Assessment for mathematics.\nEinhorn said teachers were impressed with how well students performed.\nOverall, 14% of those students were in the 80th percentile or higher, 19% were between the 61st and 80th percentile, 18% were between the 41st and 60th percentile, 21% were between the 21st and 40th percentile and 25% were between the 1st and 20th percentile.\nAlong with measuring growth through testing throughout the year, Einhorn said teachers are working very closely with the K-6 Math Curriculum Supervisor Daisy Bradwell.\n\"They are doing a deep dive into the curriculum,\" Einhorn said, adding that Bradwell is working with teachers to identify what things might be missing from the curriculum.\nFOSTERING AN ENGAGING ENVIRONMENT Director of Student Services Darlene Spurrier started off her presentation by listing different strategies the district is employing to achieve fostering an engaging environment.\nThese strategies include school-based mental health services and substance abuse intervention and prevention; restorative practices training; and individual school wellness plans and wellness coaches.\n\"Many of (these strategies) are ongoing and will not ever really move to completed because they're things that we're just going to continue to do,\" she said.\nWhen it came to data, Spurrier shared the results of three climate surveys - an internal survey from this year and the Maryland School Climate Surveys from last year and the year before that. Each of the surveys measure student and educator attitudes on four domains: community, environment, relationships and safety.\nComparing the student survey TCPS took this year to the state's survey from last year, within those four domains, students considered physical safety, physical environment and participation and engagement significantly better this year than the previous two years.\nComparing the teacher survey TCPS took this year to the state's survey from last year, teachers also ranked participation and engagement and physical safety significantly higher. They also ranked substance abuse higher than last year, meaning it is less of a concern in schools this year. Teachers ranked bullying lower on the scale this year compared to last year, meaning it is more of a concern.\nHIGHLY QUALIFIED AND DIVERSE STAFF Assistant Superintendent for Administrative and Support Services Lynne Duncan presented data on new hires, recruitment and TCPS's Grow Your Own Teachers Scholarship Program.\nBefore she spoke, Pepukayi said that retaining, not just recruiting, is important to the district.\n\"With the shortages across our nation in education, we want to make sure the people who are here, we're tending to,\" she said.\nAccording to Duncan's presentation, last school year, 197 out of 234 people, or 84%, accepted offers of employment.\nThis year, 90 out of 126 people, or 71%, accepted offers of employment.\nDuncan said that, to date, four of those new hires this year have left employment.\nIn terms of demographics of new teaching staff this year, 32 teachers are white and two are Hawaiian.\nTCPS attended seven recruitment fairs last school year. Duncan said it yielded one support staff employee.\nThe district plans to attend a total of eight recruiting events this school year. So far, it has visited three.\nOf the five people enrolled in the district's Grow Your Own Teachers Scholarship Program last year, four have been hired. The program gives TCPS students enrolled in college a scholarship if they agree to teach in the district after they graduate. Duncan said that of the nine remaining students enrolled in the program, one will graduate this month, one will graduate in June of 2024, three will graduate in 2026 and four will graduate in 2027.\nAt the end of the meeting, board member Jymil Thompson said he could see that the administrative team has clear vision, alignment and transparency.\n\"I think you all do a fabulous, fabulous job of that,\" he said. \"I want to see where the district's going to be in a couple years because I think it's definitely trickling in the right direction. So I'm anxious to be a part of that.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TRO VATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi speaks at a Board of Education meeting Dec. 13 in Easton.\n\n MAGGIE TRO VATO/MTRO VATO@CHESPUB.COM\n\n Talbot County Board of Education President Emily Jackson (pictured) and Vice President Candace Henry were reelected as president and vice president during a board meeting Dec. 13. \"It's a pleasure to serve in this role, and I'm excited to do it again for another year,\" Jackson said at the meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Radcliffe Creek School awarded 'social-emotional' learning grant\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Local News \n \n 534\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Radcliffe Creek School (RCS) was recently awarded a grant from the Queen Anne's County Mental Health Committee (QACMHC) to expand its social-emotional learning curriculum. The new funding will broaden the robust curriculum already in place for younger students, bringing social-emotional resources to older students and their parents, as well as to the local community.Social-emotional skills serve as a guide for people to understand social situations and relationships: these abilities are central to navigating the world successfully in everyday life. Debbie Cohee-Wright, a special education learning specialist at RCS explained, \"If a child has a mental health issue of any kind, such as trauma, depression or anxiety, their ability to learn and access information is compromised. For a student to be available for learning, they must first feel emotionally safe. Making connections with teachers and peers and building trust with others must happen before the focus on academics can take place.\"\nCurrently, the school's social-emotional learning program encompasses two curriculums targeted to younger students who are identified as needing support to strengthen these skills. The program, administered by Intervention Transition Skills Coach Bryn Ponti, utilizes fun, engaging activities that integrate kid- friendly themes: kids imagine themselves as detectives who look for clues in their environment or as superheroes who earn superpowers, all while learning about executive functioning, perspective taking and self-regulation.\nHead of School Peter Thayer said, \"At RCS, we always try to meet students where they are in their learning, and here, that includes their social-emotional wellbeing. This grant from QACMHC will make a considerable difference in the lives of our older students and their families, many of whom are neurodivergent and need extra support in this area.\"\nThe funding provided by QACMHC will bring two additional curriculums—Brain Talk and Conscious Discipline—to the school, expanding its social-emotional programming to older students and their families.\nBrain Talk is a curriculum designed to teach students about the different areas of their brains, educating children about their executive function capabilities and how they impact responses to situations.\nConscious Discipline is a course designed for teachers, parents and guardians, providing adults with tools to show children better ways to self-regulate and build resilience.\n\"These grants are made possible by community support of our fundraisers and through generous donations from local businesses and individuals,\" QACMHC President Kelly Phipps said. \"We appreciate the outpouring of support whenever we have a fundraiser or ask for donations.\"\nIn addition to the new resources this grant will provide to Radcliffe Creek School's teachers, students and their families, the QACMHC grant will allow RCS to bring social-emotional programming to the local community as well. Planning is already underway to host an event for the public, bringing this important topic to local parents, teachers and residents in 2024. \"We are so grateful to QACMHC for their support of our school's social-emotional learning program. These funds will directly impact our students' mental health by supporting children both in the classroom and at home, leading to a more positive school environment, a greater sense of empowerment among our teachers and parents, and an increased sense of confidence in our children. We are excited to bring these resources to the Radcliffe Creek School community and beyond in 2024,\" remarked Director of Advancement Carolyn Thompson. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "'Diving Deep' with Dyslexia: Local Special Education Teacher Works to Raise Awareness",
    "date": "2024-01-05",

    "content": "'Diving Deep' with dyslexia: Local special education teacher works to raise awareness\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TAMARA FORTE Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 1217\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE — What do Robin Williams, Jay Leno, Albert Einstein, Alexander Graham Bell, Magic Johnson, Jennifer Aniston, Gwen Stefani, Abraham Lincoln, and Arnold Schwarzenegger all have in common? They all have dyslexia.Lindsey Parte, a mother of two boys and Special Education teacher, has reignited the Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter that fizzled out during the Covid pandemic.\nParte shares that she has been \"diving deep into advocating and teaching herself (about dyslexia)\" for the last three years.\nWhen Parte's older son, Lincoln, was six years old, he struggled with both speech and reading. Parte said a red flag to her son's learning struggle was \"knowing how smart he was but not understanding why reading was so hard.\"\nParte explains that her two-year younger son was making gains on her older son. In contrast, reading was coming with ease to her younger son.\nOn the first day of second grade, Lincoln (her older son) came home and said, \"I can't do this. I can't read. I hate school.\" Lincoln was frustrated with learning and wanted to quit.\nIt was heartbreaking for Parte as a mother and as a special education teacher herself as no one wants to see their child struggle, especially with learning. Parte explained, reading is the gateway to learning and lifelong success, and as such, learning to read successfully is vital to all.\nTwo years after Parte first suspected Lincoln was dyslexic, Lincoln got his formal diagnosis. Parte explained that getting the diagnosis meant freedom for her and her son.\nShe recounts, \"I will never forget the utter sigh of relief when we told him he has dyslexia. It all made sense to him from that moment on. Within a week, he was already talking about it in class and advocating for himself. And most importantly, we got our boy back. His light turned back on.\"\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, dyslexia is \"a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). Also called a reading disability, dyslexia is a result of individual differences in areas of the brain that process language.\"\nAn MRI shows the physical differences in the brain composition of a dyslexic thinker versus a non-dyslexic thinker. Dyslexia is so common that one in five people are a dyslexic learners.\nWhat is it like to have dyslexia? How can I help and support a dyslexic learner? What are the early indicators of dyslexia? These questions and many others will be answered at 6:30 p.m., Feb. 20, at the \"Experience Dyslexia: A Dyslexia Simulation\" workshop at the Queen Anne's County Library Kent Island Branch location.\nThe free event, hosted by Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter, aims to raise dyslexia awareness, empower families to support their children, encourage educational interventions, and ultimately influence policy makers to support Maryland students with dyslexia.\nAll are welcome. The event will offer six stations to help understand the dyslexic learner: Learn to Read, Listen to Me, Write with Mirrors, Name the Letter, Write or Left, and Unfair Hearing Test.\nParte says,\"The two biggest takeaways I have learned over the last year of my deep dive into my son's brain and the way he learns are early identification is crucial (as young as five-years-old); and the dyslexic brain requires instruction to be explicit, systematic, cumulative and multisensory.\n\"It should integrate the teaching of listening, speaking, reading, spelling, vocabulary, fluency, handwriting and written expression. There should be an emphasis on the structure of language: phonology, orthography, morphology, syntax and semantics. Training teachers and educating parents is also of the utmost importance,\" she continued.\nSince then, Lincoln has helped his mom set up and lead workshops. In October, to celebrate Dyslexia Awareness Month, this mother and son duo led the Halloween-themed workshop entitled \"There is nothing scarier than not being able to read.\"\nParte believes in dyslexia awareness and education with her whole being, which is why she fundraised, on her own, to purchase the upcoming workshop materials.\nAfter more than three years of advocating, Parte promotes all adults to learn as much as they can by listening to podcasts, attending free trainings, reading books and fact sheets, and much more.\nMoving forward, what steps can we take?\n\"Release the stigma. Embrace the label,\" Parte said. \"The label means freedom. It gives a child the right to read. The right to appropriate instruction which in turns means success in reading and regaining self confidence. We got our child back the moment we told him he had dyslexia. The label opens a world of resources for your child to feel good about themselves. Priority is a child's mental and social wellbeing.\"\nDyslexic Learners have many strengths and show a lot of leadership skills. Some other positive skills of dyslexic learners include: problem-solving, big picture thinking, creativity, empathetic, and entrepreneurial skills.\nParte shared things parents can do to help their struggling reader if they suspect their child has dyslexia:\nTesting is everything. You will be surprised how relieved your child is with a \"diagnosis\".\nFinding the right intervention specialist (tutors in reading are not the same as someone trained and certified in structured reading interventions like Orton Gillingham). Tutoring at least three times a week is most effective. The key to remediation is \"go as fast as you can and as slow as you need to\". Early intervention is crucial especially to maintain your child's confidence in school.\nDeep dive in your own research. It will help with advocacy, ensuring the right assessments are being used, and knowing the right questions to vet organizations and other folks who claim to want to help your student.\nRead to your child not so they learn to read but so that they develop their reading comprehension and vocabulary while they are learning to read with appropriate interventions.\nIf your child receives the diagnosis of dyslexia, tell them, she encourages. Share all the amazing qualities a dyslexic thinker has and famous people who have dyslexia. Show them a photograph of a dyslexic brain vs typical brain.\nKnowledge and support in this process are so important. You don't have to go through this emotional journey alone. Connect with your local Decoding Dyslexia chapter.\nParte explains, \"Most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an important role.\nThough there's no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention result in the best outcome. Sometimes dyslexia goes undiagnosed for years and isn't recognized until adulthood, but it's never too late to seek help.\"\nCommunity support, awareness, education, and training will help all our learners learn in the best ways to be successful, happy learners. Together, we can impact our future and the future of our children. If you cannot attend the workshop at the library but are interested in gaining resources and learning more, you can email decodingdyslexiaES@gmail.com for more information and for a Welcome Newsletter with a list of more resources.\nCurrently, Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter is a grassroots movement (not a nonprofit), which means it has no funding and is paid for all out-of-pocket. It is run by parents who are also working professionals.\n\"The fight continues,\" Parte said, \"Until every single child (and their families) don't have to go through this hell and back to learn how to read.\"\nTo support and make a donation to Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter, you can also email Parte at the email above. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some of his doppelgängers even brought their own fake metal detectors — a hobby of Bailey's.\nAfter eight years teaching at DCTC, Bailey is hanging up his trowel and picking up his metal detector.\n\"You know, I love metal detecting, so I'll probably go find the Holy Grail or something,\" he said about what he will do in his retirement.\nWhen Bailey came in for his last day of teaching, right before winter break began, it took a little while for him to figure out what his coworkers had done.\n\"I'm like, 'Wait a minute, something don't look right,'\" he said. \"Then, when I saw the metal detectors, I was like, 'Ohh, they got me good!'\"\nDCTC Principal Ashley Robinson came up with the idea.\n\"I was just trying to really think about how we could celebrate his time here in a way that he would enjoy and that he would feel appreciated,\" she said. \"So I really thought the best way to do that would be with humor, since that's something he really enjoys.\"\nIn order to keep it a surprise, Robinson said she made it a part of the school's holiday spirit week.\n\"So he thought everyone was just dressing in comfy sweatshirts,\" she said. \"And I let everyone else know we were really just dressing like Mr. Bailey.\"\nBailey, who was surprised by his coworkers' plan, thought it was funny.\n\"It was so great because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said. \"I would have never expected that.\"\nBailey said he knew Robinson had something to do with it.\n\"She comes up with such cool stuff,\" he said, adding that she gave him a plaque with a trowel on it to commemorate his time teaching at DCTC.\nHe said there's a reason he would wear the similar outfit that his coworkers knew so well to work everyday.\n\"Working in the masonry, you can't really go in there with real good clothes on,\" he said. \"You gotta wear your oldest stuff. Like, inside my car, all you see is dust.\"\nRobinson said Bailey, like the rest of DCTC's staff members, epitomizes the importance of CTE education.\n\"The majority of the teachers here have worked in industry in their field, they have those life experiences and then they chose to come back and give back and work with kids to set them up to be successful,\" she said. \"We were happy to have (Bailey) and happy that he was able to do this.\"\nBailey has had a few different careers over the years. He owned a masonry business, was a prison guard and spent four years in the Marine Corps. But teaching is in Bailey's blood. His father taught at James M. Bennett High School in Salisbury.\n\"He was football coach, track coach,\" Bailey said. \"And we lived right across the street from Bennett, so I was at school every day. I knew it from top to bottom.\"\nHe has memories of cigarette smoke \"flying out of the teachers' lounge\" and teachers coming over to his family's house to play cards with his father.\n\"I mean, that was the good old days,\" he said.\nLooking toward his retirement, Bailey has plans to further explore the hobby his DCTC coworkers know he loves.\nBailey said the Career and Technology Center staff knew about his metal detecting because he would send them photos of some of his finds.\nOver the last five years, Bailey said he has gotten more and more into metal detecting. His neighbors, known as The Hoover Boys on YouTube, post metal detecting videos. They have over 100,000 YouTube subscribers. When they moved next door, Bailey said they started giving him their hand-me-downs.\nOver the years, Bailey has found all sorts of things — from shoe buckle frames to Civil War bullets to cannonballs. Two of his major finds were a rare George Washington inaugural button and a pine tree shilling.\nAlthough he has plans to do more detecting, Bailey said he'll miss his students.\n\"A lot of them played sports, and I'd hook them up with a sub,\" he said. \"It was always a sub, a red Gatorade, orange Doritos.\"\nAs he moves on to his next chapter, Bailey now has fond memories of his own teaching experience to look back on.\n\"Oh I loved it,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said they will all do the best they can to continue providing students with a top-quality education.\n\"Working with you has been an absolute joy,\" Goetz said to Couch. \"There's been a lot of ups and downs, but we'll celebrate all that as we move forward.\"\nAs a first step in the KCPS leadership transition, the Board of Education is holding a special meeting at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 23 to discuss the search for the next superintendent. The meeting will be held at the KCPS Administrative Building, 5608 Boundary Ave., Rock Hall.\nCouch is retiring in the back half of her third four-year term as the superintendent of KCPS. Her most recent contract renewal was approved in the spring of 2021 for four years.\nShe first came on board at KCPS on July 1, 2013, having led a candidate field of nearly 20 applicants.\nCouch was named the Maryland Superintendent of the Year in 2021. She made her mark on KCPS early, launching a technological revolution by bringing computers and smartboards into classrooms, greatly expanding teachers' and students' access to educational resources.\nShe built a collaborative environment in schools through fostering professional learning communities, which brought teachers together to share best practices to help reach all students.\nShe also made KCPS one of the first school systems in Maryland to adopt universal all-day prekindergarten, giving children an important head start on their education. \"Amidst numerous budgetary challenges, including declining enrollment and limited resources,\nwe remained committed to prioritizing organizational improvements and addressing the diverse needs of our students and staff,\" Couch said.\nShe improved the school buildings themselves through targeted renovations, enhanced safety features like security vestibules and launching the planning process for a new middle school.\n\"During my tenure, we also executed a comprehensive six-year Facilities Strategic Plan,\nrevitalizing educational facilities untouched for over 25 years,\" she said. \"Moreover, we successfully fulfilled preliminary state requirements for the construction of a new middle school while advocating for legislation to increase state funding participation for the project.\"\nSullivan, praised Couch's professionalism in the face of myriad challenges including tight budgets, declining student enrollment and the COVID pandemic. \"You have helped our schools accomplish so much in the time that you've been here and it hasn't been easy,\" Sullivan told Couch. \"You have always been professional and represented our schools really well, and I can only imagine how tough that probably was for some things.\"\nHailing from New Mexico, Dr. Couch previously served from 2001 to 2013 as the superintendent of the Moriarty-Edgewood School District, about an hour east of Albuquerque. In 2010, she was honored as the New Mexico Superintendent of the Year.\nCouch moved to Kent County with a reputation for having turned that rural school district into one of the top-achieving in the state through a focus of continuous school improvement and the incorporation of research-based education programming.\nShe has likewise implemented similar strategies at KCPS, increasing the visibility and participation in the Career and Technical Education (CTE) program at Kent County High School, encouraging the growth of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs and training elementary school teachers in the renowned Orton-Gillingham method of English language arts instruction.\nTrish McGee, the longest serving among the current Board of Education members, was first elected the year after Couch's hiring. McGee covered the search process that saw Dr. Couch come onboard as the associate editor of the Kent County News.\nSpeaking at the Jan. 8 Board meeting, McGee said Couch paid out of her own pocket for travel from New Mexico to Kent County for one of her first interview visits. McGee said that showed just how prepared Couch was willing to go the distance to address the challenges faced by KCPS.\n\"I think every decision she ever made personally and professionally was really about how to move our school district forward,\" McGee said. \"And I can't think of a greater legacy than something like that.\"\nCouch's tenure at KCPS caps off a career in education that began in 1980 when she became a kindergarten teacher in the Las Cruces Public Schools in southern New Mexico. She was then employed by the Alamogordo Public Schools and rose through the ranks in that district from teacher to principal and, ultimately associate superintendent.\nAlong the way, she earned her master's degree and later received her doctorate in educational administration from New Mexico State University.\nCouch said she is confident that KCPS will continue to nurture and inspire every child who walks through its doors and she eagerly anticipates hearing all those future success stories.\n\"As I begin a new chapter, I know that our work has laid a strong foundation for continued student success,\" Couch said. \"The legacy of our efforts is not in the programs we've started or the facilities we've renovated, but in the lives of the students we've touched.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-01-17",
    "author": "Connie Connolly",
    "content": "DENTON — At the Jan. 9 meeting of the Caroline County Board of Education, several supervisors provided updates on progress towards meeting requirements of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a set of policies and dedicated funding seeking to transform several aspects of the state's public education system by 2026.Assistant Superintendent Dr. Tara Downes said the district has been receiving additional guidance from the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) and Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB) since spring 2023.\nAs a result, required tasks have been \"chunked out\" over a more manageable timeline, and the pillar chairs are \"actually ahead of schedule\" with some aspects of the plan.\n\"The pillar chairs have been phenomenal in being proactive when it comes to the work,\" Downes said.\nAccording to its website, \"The Blueprint for Maryland's Future was passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 to transform public education in the state into a world-class education system. The Blueprint will increase education funding by $3.8 billion each year over the next 10 years, enrich student experiences and accelerate student outcomes, as well as improve the quality of education for all children in Maryland, especially those who have been historically underserved.\"\n\"The Blueprint really involves everything that we're doing on a daily basis,\" said Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons.\nAccording to the Blueprint website, \"The bold work of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future is organized into five distinct pillars.\" Each pillar has a set of objectives to help administrators and educators align instruction and community support to them and determine needed resources.\nPillar 1: Early Childhood Education\nThe main focus of Pillar 1 is the expansion of pre-kindergarten for three-year-olds and four-year-olds, said CCPS Supervisor of Instruction Elizabeth Saylor, who serves as Pillar 1 chair.\nOf the 375 pre-K students enrolled as of Sept. 30, 58 are in pre-K three and 317 are in pre-K four. The main focus currently are Tier One families who are \"up to 300% of the federal poverty level, or 319 students. As of Jan. 9, 395 students were enrolled in pre-K,\" Saylor said.\nA challenge is the need for private daycare providers, who must follow Blueprint's criteria. Providing more qualified and more certified staff is another challenge both for Pillar 1 compliance and workforce development, an objective of Pillar 2.\n\"Making sure families and students are ready for kindergarten\" is ultimately the focus of the pillar, Saylor said.\nPillar 2: High Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders\nCCPS Supervisor of Human Resources Dr. Rob Willoughby addressed four objectives of Pillar 2, which focuses on the recruitment of high quality and diverse teachers and leaders.\nChesapeake College has been \"a fantastic partner with us through the Maryland Leads\" grant initiative, he said. The district recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Mount St. Mary's University, which offers a fully online bachelor's degree in elementary education.\nWilloughby's group is looking at other ways of providing staff and enhancing qualifications, including encouraging National Board Certified Teacher credentialing.\nForty-eight teachers are currently in the process of pursuing that certification. \"That is 10% of our teaching staff pursuing a really rigorous national certification,\" he said.\nA Pillar 2 challenge includes a starting teacher salary of $60,000 by Blueprint's July 1, 2026, deadline.\n\"Our starting teacher salary this year $53,167, and … we're about $6,800 to the end,\" Willoughby said. \"If you divide that over the three fiscal years we have, that means it needs to go up at least $2,278 (per year).\"\nPillar 3: College and Career Readiness\nBlueprint's third pillar focuses on students' college and career readiness.\nCollege and Career Readiness Director Lindsey McCormick explained the progress being made towards complying with Pillar 3 of the Blueprint as the district works under interim standards. Students are assessed at the end of their 10th grade year and can choose a career pathway. The district offers 16 Career and Technology Education (CTE) pathways.\nIn addition to pursuing a college track and taking advanced placement courses, students can receive career counseling. Students in AP courses are now required to sit for the exams in the spring; the tests are paid for by the district.\n\"I am very pleased to say that this year through our MOU with the (Upper Shore) Workforce Investment Board, we have added one high school and one middle school career coach that are in the buildings five days a week working with students,\" McCormick said.\nShe said the district is growing the youth apprenticeship program and modeling it for businesses.\nIf students are not college and career ready, the district is working on a pilot program to provide supports, including online study, to help them meet state standards, McCormick said. Chesapeake College supplied data from the past three years that showed students' learning online was just as successful as classroom learning.\nPillar 4: More Resources to Ensure that All Students are Successful\nPillar 4 of Blueprint seeks to provide students with more resources that could help them succeed.\nSupervisor of Instruction Christal Harkowa, one of the co-chairs for Pillar 4, updated the school board on multilingual learners.\nThe district has hired two multilingual learner family coordinators to work with Spanish- and Haitian Creole-speaking constituents.\n\"We have really been able to improve our communication with our families,\" Harkowa said. \"They are very dedicated; they stay after (school), they attend all kinds of after school events, parent conferences when we need them for 504 or IEP (Individualized Education Program) meetings to make sure our parents understand what the needs of their students are and to be able to advocate and ask questions.\"\nShe said her goal by the end of this school year is to \"identify MLL families for parent leadership opportunities.\"\nTo support MLLs in instruction and language acquisition, the district is providing ongoing professional development for teachers and instructional assistants while \"being respectful of their planning time,\" Harkowa said. Another focus is helping students develop English proficiency in elementary school.\nSupervisor of Special Education Erica McDonald discussed the objective of closing the achievement gap for students with disabilities.\nThe leadership team created a mission statement at the beginning of the current school year, provided Goalbook toolkit training and additional training to help teachers and co-teachers meet objectives and monitor \"disproportionate identification and disciplinary practices.\"\n\"Our special education teacher specialists have really taken on the role of educational diagnosticians,\" she said.\nA Blueprint objective is to \"establish or enhance Community Schools in areas of concentrated poverty.\" Three CCPS schools — Federalsbury Elementary, Greensboro Elementary and Colonel Richardson Middle School — meet the criteria and have district coordinators assigned to them.\nSupervisor of Student Services Nicole Fisher reported the Pillar 4 team is committed to evidence-based practices, but challenges facing the district are providing adequate behavioral health staffing and transportation.\nSimmons said \"As Blueprint ratchets up, all nine of our schools are going to qualify for Concentration of Poverty funding due to the FARMS (Free and Reduced-Price Meals) rates in all of our schools … in about another two or three years.\"\nPillar 5: Governance and Accountability\n\"Pillar 5 is what pulls together all of the other pillars,\" Simmons said, explaining that the pillar focuses on governance and accountability.\nTwo main areas of focus are the \"stakeholder engagement plan\" and Blueprint funding and resources which require \"money following the students.\"\n\"Pillars 1 through 4 have done an incredible job of reaching out to community members, and they've got strong, robust teams that are getting lots of feedback,\" Simmons said, elaborating on the stakeholder engagement objective.\n\"There are shifts — monumental shifts in some areas — for the way that we're doing (Blueprint),\" he said. \"But eventually we'll stop talking about Blueprint, and we'll just be talking about what it is that we're doing that connects to the strategic plan, because the overlap will be there when it's closer to full implementation.\"\nThe complete report is linked in the Jan. 9 meeting agenda, where you can also watch the complete school board meeting at carolineschools.new.swagit.com/videos/294177\nThe MSDE Blueprint Implementation Plan is available at bit.ly/BlueprintPlanMSDE. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Superintendent shares schools' budget constraints with Commissioners\n\n January 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: Local News \n \n 512\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Caroline County Public Schools officials shared good news and bad news with the Caroline County Commissioners at a Jan. 16 meeting.The good news: Caroline County Public Schools ended the year with a $3.25 million surplus.\nThe not-so-good news: The Blueprint for Maryland's Future unfunded mandate puts the fiscal squeeze on the budget and pandemic-based grant funding disappears in fiscal year 2025, officials said.\nChief Finance Officer Erin Thornton and Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons shared with the commissioners what they need to prepare for as the school district's budget planning continues.\n\"We have always been good stewards of the money and we're fiscally conservative, trying not to just spend money just to spend it, so we were prepared to end the year with money on the books,\" Thornton said.\nThe unassigned fund balance is currently at $9.5 million, \"which is approximately 8.4% of our current operating budget,\" she said. \"Our target range for a fund balance is one to 10%. So, we are approaching a high, which is where we want to be.\"\nCommissioner Frank Bartz asked about maintaining support services salaries, something that he said is not addressed in the Blueprint.\n\"A lot of people in the county work for support services,\" he said. \"I just want to make sure that they're taken care of.\"\n\"You're spot on,\" Simmons said. \"The Blueprint addresses teachers only and leaves out two-thirds of our workgroup, and (it) does not take into consideration any support staff or administration. Required increases to salaries are … for the most part, to classroom-based teachers with kids on the workload.\"\nSimmons said the Supportive Services Association is a negotiated employee group.\n\"Their contract was ratified to be closed from 2012 until next year, so that has been a closed contract with a required 1% in step every year, and then it's 1% in addition to whatever the teachers get. Their contract comes open next year for us to negotiate.\"\nSimmons said the \"biggest challenge that we're going to see this year\" is the Blueprint formula's increase of 1.7% over last year's budget \"when inflation is currently still running over 3%, and that factors in no increases in health insurance, which is probably 5% to 7% right now, we're hearing.\"\nThat percentage does not factor in any pay increase. Blueprint requires first-year classroom teachers to be earning $60,000 by fiscal year 2027.\n\"After this year, the budget increases roughly 5%,\" Simmons said. \"We're sitting in a different position in our county than some of our colleagues are in others. … A lot of the larger systems are looking at significant cuts of teaching positions because (of) that 1.7% increase. It's a regressive budget no matter how you cut it, when it's only that much of an increase, and the cost of living is definitely a lot higher.\"\nWhen COVID funding and (Maryland) Leads funding \"dries up in September at the same time as we're getting a 1.7% increase, that's the perfect storm,\" Simmons said. \"And again, we'll weather it for our staff. We'll figure it out. I really, truly believe we will. It's just going to be a really tough year.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eastern Shore Delegation to ask governor for Cade formula restoration\n\n January 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: General Assembly \n \n 482\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — At a meeting Friday, the Eastern Shore Delegation voted to send a letter to the governor's office asking that the Cade Funding Formula for community colleges be restored in a supplemental budget.Gov. Wes Moore's proposed fiscal year 2025 budget calls for the reduction of $22 million in Cade formula funding to community colleges in the state.\nThe Cade formula essentially ties state funding for community colleges to state funding for designated University System of Maryland institutions, according to the Maryland Association of Community Colleges.\nMoore's proposal would reduce the Cade formula from 29% to 26.5%.\nThat percentage — the amount of funding community colleges receive from the state — is based on the funding given to public four-year institutions per full-time equivalent student.\nAt the Eastern Shore Delegation meeting, legislators were joined by the presidents of colleges that are located on the Eastern Shore, as well as MACC Executive Director Brad Phillips.\nPhillips called rebasing the Cade formula a \"budget word\" for inequity.\n\"Look at it this way,\" he said. \"If you're giving a student a dollar to go to a University System of Maryland or a four-year public institution, the policy goal is that 29 cents goes to community colleges. ... (with the reduction,) you're cutting community colleges out. You're still providing a dollar to our four-year friends.\"\nWor-Wic Community College President Deborah Casey told the delegation she had spent hours preparing a budget with an 11% cut.\n\"That's $1.5 million for Wor-Wic Community College,\" she said of the budget cut. \"That doesn't work for us.\"\nCasey said that she can't build infrastructure and carry Wor-Wic in the best direction with a budget reduction of this magnitude.\n\"And you're expecting and asking us, and holding us accountable to making sure we're meeting many needs of this community,\" she said. \"Please help us get that full funding.\"\nPhillips said Maryland's community colleges are up 8.3% in enrollment this year.\n\"So this is a cut that would actually stretch less funding to more students,\" he said.\nDuring the meeting, both Casey and Chesapeake College President Cliff Coppersmith mentioned increases in enrollment at their schools.\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) said this increased enrollment is one reason why this formula change is concerning.\nDel. Jefferson Ghrist (R-36, Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline), who made the motion to send the letter, said the Maryland Department of Legislative Services had given the House Appropriations Committee, which he is a member of, a list of possible cuts that could be made in order to restore the Cade formula to 29%.\n\"There's a lot of places that we can go to find money to restore that,\" he said.\nGhrist said getting the Cade formula restored in a supplemental budget, however, would make the job of the House Appropriations Committee easier.\n\"That way it'll be done before we start really getting down to work on the budget,\" he said. \"That would make our jobs a heck of a lot easier on the committee.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This is a nearly $7.9 million increase from fiscal year 2024.\nTCPS Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said that while this seems like a larger increase than recent years, the increase is meant to offset a decrease in federal funding.\n\"This unrestricted budget coupled with the decrease in all of our federal programs nets to a 3.4% increase,\" she said.\nThis means that the district is asking for a total of 3.4% more money than it received for fiscal year 2024.\nTCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the district is losing $4.8 million in grant funding for fiscal year 2025.\nTCPS Director of Communications Debbie Gardner said in an interview that the $4.8 million came from two COVID-19 related grants — the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund and the Maryland Leads grant.\nThe proposed capital budget for fiscal year 2025 is $12.1 million. Capital requests include the renovation and expansion of Chapel District Elementary School, the installation of a turf field at Easton High School, the replacement of auditorium lights at Easton High School, the installation of a basketball court at Easton Elementary School, an update to the stadium lighting at Easton High School and a playground replacement at St. Michaels Elementary School.\nNext month, the proposed budget will be presented to the County Council. A public budget hearing, held by the County Council, is set for May.\nBoard President Emily Jackson thanked TCPS staff for \"the huge lift\" of preparing the budget.\n\"Go forth and get this passed,\" she said. \"You can do it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Einhorn said this includes discussing any challenges the district might be facing with implementation.\nThis report is a way for the state to monitor that school districts are \"able to transform\" through reshaping and adapting new polices and practices that create a more equitable system, Einhorn said.\n\"I'm here tonight to assure you that we will meet that March 15 deadline,\" she said. \"And I look forward to sharing some of the findings in that report.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Winter break will begin Dec. 20.\nThe calendar committee emailed a link to the survey Jan. 12 to over 5,400 parents, guardians and all CCPS staff members. A reminder email was sent Jan. 22, and the survey was closed Jan. 26. Some community members provided feedback, as well.\nAlthough 75% of the 3,500 parents and guardians who responded favored a post-Labor Day start, 696 staff respondents, or 70% preferred a pre-Labor Day start.\nBefore reviewing the feedback, Simmons cautioned the school board, saying, \"No matter what decision you make, you're going to make people upset, period. There is no perfect calendar, period.\"\nBoard member and retired Caroline County teacher Donna DiGiacomo favored the earlier start.\n\"So, one calendar starts Aug 28; the other starts Sept. 3, but the end date is just one day difference,\" DiGiacomo said. The adopted calendar gets \"students in a routine quicker, and you have a shorter week when you start — you have three days, so everybody's not dead by Friday.\"\nShe said a 4-day first day of school \"doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a lot.\"\nWinter break begins with a half-day Friday, Dec. 20, and students returning to school Jan. 7.\n\"A hard shutdown over winter break for two solid weeks\" would result in reduced heating costs and \"significant savings\" during \"the hardest budget year we're going to have,\" Simmons said.\nThe post-Labor Day calendar would have had students returning Thursday, Jan. 2, 2025.\n\"This might not be a popular thing to say, but the reality is not a whole lot is going to get done on that Thursday and Friday,\" DiGiacomo said.\nOther factors influencing the pre-Labor Day start were academic quarter dates and required parent-teacher conferences, which \"we talked about ad nauseum,\" Simmons said.\nCalling the process \"wonky\" and comparing it to a game of dominoes, Simmons explained the factors that prompted the calendar committee to go through \"seven or eight drafts to get down to the two that made the most sense.\"\nFor example, the first quarter parent-teacher conference day will occur Nov. 5, even though it's election day, because the first quarter ends Nov. 8 and the conference day \"has to fall before the first report card goes out, before grades are secured,\" Simmons said.\nThe adopted calendar has four inclement weather days built in. If they are not used, they come off the calendar.\nState law, teacher contracts, mandatory conferences, state testing days, a set number of half-days, a mid-year transition day all dictate certain days off. Once all of the days off are built in, \"it becomes a game of counting to 90 twice\" to achieve a state-mandated 180-day school year, Simmons said.\nDiGiacomo recommended surveying students next year and considering staggered starts for sixth grade and ninth grade students as they change schools.\n\"The pluses of draft two are just not as many as the pluses in draft one,\" said Rick Barton, president of the school board.\nAlthough he liked \"the idea of a longer break,\" school board Vice President Mark Jones was ambivalent.\n\"I honestly don't like either one of them, really,\" he said.\nThat ambivalence was reflected in the overall survey results, with 54% of all respondents preferring a post-Labor Day start and 46% going with the pre-Labor Day calendar.\nAnticipating mixed reactions from the public and staff as well, Jones asked, \"When do we want to hear complaints? Do we want to hear them right before the first day of school, or do we want to hear them after Christmas break? I think I'd probably rather hear them at the beginning of the year and get it out of the way.\"\nTo view the 2024-2025 CCPS school year calendar, visit www.carolineschools.org/page/ccps-school-calendar.

A week later, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, the Board announced that Bromwell would be stepping down from his position, effective March 1.\nBromwell was officially appointed as superintendent in 2020 with a four year term. Before that, he served as interim superintendent for the district. In his time at DCPS, he has also served as a teacher in the district and as the principal of Cambridge-South Dorchester High School.\nAccording to the Feb. 21 statement from the Board of Education, the decision for Bromwell to step down in March was \"mutually decided\" by him and the Board. In the Feb. 16 statement, the Board expressed gratitude to Bromwell for his years of service to DCPS.\nValerie Goff, DCPS communication and community outreach specialist, said Bromwell, who was not present at the Board meeting Thursday, had no comments at this time.\nAt the meeting, Board Vice President Susan Morgan acknowledged that the district is experiencing change \"once again.\"\n\"But I do trust in our teachers, our administrators, our directors and, now, our interim superintendent, to keep us moving forward,\" she said. \"Through everything we as a Board do, we always keep in the front of our minds what's best for all the children that we serve.\"\nBoard Member Chris Wheedleton said the search for the district's next leader can't happen without \"recognizing the value of somebody who has given close to 40 years of service to the district.\"\n\"I want to thank Mr. Bromwell for his service and for what he has done,\" Wheedleton said.\nEarlier in the meeting, Milton Nagel and Bill Middleton from the Maryland Association of Boards of Education presented on what to keep in mind when conducting a superintendent search.\nNagel told the Board that although it was not their reason for attending the meeting, MABE does conduct superintendent searches for its member districts.\n\"If the Board so desires to engage in that conversation about potentially having MABE do a search, we can certainly facilitate that,\" he said.\nIn a statement released later that night, the Board said it will begin the search for a new superintendent to take office July 1.\nToward the end of his remarks at the meeting Thursday, Thompson, who is also a board member of the Talbot County Board of Education, told the public that they will get mad at him.\n\"But I want you to also understand this — and I mean this from the bottom of my heart — that I'm always going to make the best decisions that I think are right for kids,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland’s teacher shortage: Will the Blueprint’s plan for better pay, training do enough?\n\n March 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AIDAN HUGHES and DARANEE BALACHANDAR Capital News Service | Section: Business \n \n 1505\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fifth-grade teacher Melissa Carpenter works a 10-hour day on average during the week, and her job sometimes requires her to put in hours on weekends, too.\"I feel like teaching is one of those jobs where we go to work to do more work — to do work after work,\" said Carpenter, who teaches at William B. Wade Elementary School in Waldorf, in Charles County.\nCarpenter's long hours are far from unique among Maryland's educators, as the state and nation grapple with a teacher shortage.\nThe U.S. Department of Education keeps a Teacher Shortage Areas database — and it found that for the current school year, Maryland was short of teachers in 28 subjects, which the state defines as \"areas of certification.\" That's up from 17 five years earlier.\nSome teacher certification areas — such as English as a second language, health science and special education — are short on teachers from pre-K through the 12th grade.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future — a landmark state law reforming public education — aims to fix that problem by \"elevating the stature of the teaching profession\" through higher pay, better training and stronger recruitment efforts.\nHowever, experts and educators have mixed views about whether that will successfully address the root causes of the shortage.\n\"Money is a huge help, but it's not everything,\" said Simon Birenbaum, director of grading, assessment and scheduling at Baltimore City Public Schools. \"Human capital is the biggest issue, and money can help with that problem, but recruiting, training and retaining high-quality teachers and staff has to be the primary focus. No amount of money can compensate for a lack of highly-skilled educators.\"\nDocumenting the shortageMaryland's teacher woes follow national trends. The National Center for Education Statistics reported 86% of U.S. K-12 public schools faced challenges in hiring teachers for the current school year.\nAmid the shortage, the Blueprint calls for hiring an unspecified number of additional teachers to ease the workload of classroom veterans.\n\"You hear a lot about the teacher shortage — and how are we going to implement all these Blueprint programs, which require additional staffing, when we have a teacher shortage?\" asked Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\nShortages stem, in part, from the fact that teachers are leaving the profession. In Prince George's County, 1,126 teachers resigned between July 2022 and July 2023 — up from 989 the previous year, The Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, 625 resigned in Montgomery County Public Schools, up from 576 a year earlier.\nDorchester County experienced the highest attrition rate in Maryland during the 2021-22 school year at 18%, according to a Department of Education report.\n\"I used to never have people just quit in the middle of the year,\" said Dorchester County Superintendent Dave Bromwell, who recently retired. \"The pandemic told some people, you know what? If you're not happy, move on.\"\nAll those factors end up impacting teachers like Carpenter. She said her grade level saw an influx of students, with around 30 students in her own fifth grade class this year.\n\"Our class sizes are growing, and we don't have the support in place to help some of our struggling learners,\" she said.\n'teaching isn't approved'Schools are suffering from a long-term decline in the number of people interested in becoming teachers.\nThat decline has been ongoing since the mid-'70s, \"but it gets worse and worse and worse, year over year,\" said Mike Hansen, an education policy expert at the Brookings Institution.\nAccording to the State Department of Education, 9,134 people were enrolled in teacher preparation programs in the state in 2012. That number plummeted by about half by 2017, but rose to 6,037 by 2020.\nWhy is teaching becoming less appealing as a career? Zid Mancenido, a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, has been studying that issue.\n\"One of the major findings of my research has been that people are taught over time that teaching isn't a great career,\" he said in a 2022 interview on the school's website. \"There are all these tiny interactions they have over their lifetime that give them this feeling that teaching isn't approved, that they should be aspiring to other careers that might be more prestigious or well-paid.\"\nAmid the shortage, many schools hire less-credentialed \"conditional\" teachers — those who have not yet received their professional certifications. Maryland's issuance of conditional certificates more than doubled between 2018 to 2022, a state Department of Education report said.\nIn Charles County, where Carpenter works, 12.4% of all teachers held conditional certificates by 2021 — a rate only surpassed by Baltimore City (13.4%) and Prince George's County (14.3%).\nCarpenter said experienced teachers are leaned on to help the conditional hires.\n\"Which would be fine if you had one or two teachers who needed that support. But we have a massive amount of teachers who are conditional right now,\" she said.\nThe Blueprint's pay bumpIn order to address the teacher shortage, the Blueprint provides a number of measures that lawmakers hope will encourage people to become teachers and ensure that existing ones don't leave for more lucrative out-of-state positions — or exit the profession altogether.\nA key Blueprint initiative increases teacher pay to a minimum of $60,000 by 2026. In some counties, that means a nearly $15,000 pay bump for new teachers.\nDavid Larner, chief human resource and professional development officer at the Howard County Public School System, said the pay raise will attract teachers from other states and build up Maryland's teacher workforce.\n\"If our salaries are higher than salaries in surrounding states … then candidates are more likely to come,\" Larner explained.\nHowever, Hansen, of the Brookings Institution, expressed skepticism about the likely impact of the measure on the state's teacher shortage.\nHansen argued that rather than a universal rise in minimum salary levels, money should be targeted where it's needed the most — attracting teacher talent in high-need schools and specialized fields like STEM subjects and special education. He also highlighted research that suggests salary is just one of many factors that can lead to teacher attrition.\n\"I think we need to be paying teachers more — I don't think paying a $60,000 minimum wage is the way to do it,\" he said.\nBoosting careers and diversityThe Blueprint also aims to improve teacher quality by encouraging educators to obtain additional training.\nThe plan provides for a salary increase of $10,000 for teachers who become National Board Certified, an advanced teaching credential that fewer than 6% of Maryland teachers held at the start of 2023, according to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. Teachers in high-need areas may see their annual salaries increase by up to $17,000 by becoming certified.\n\"We want to professionalize the career of teaching, and I think that is absolutely what we should be doing,\" said Stephanie Novak Pappas, principal of the Holabird Academy, an elementary and middle school in Baltimore.\nHowever, Hansen questioned the Blueprint's emphasis on National Board certification.\n\"We don't have a lot of evidence that actually getting your NBC makes you a better teacher,\" Hansen said.\nThe Blueprint also calls on school districts to create a diverse workforce. The Accountability and Implementation Board — which oversees the Blueprint — will evaluate those efforts.\nA diverse workforce has significant benefits, according to David Blazar, an education policy expert at the University of Maryland.\nBlazar said that increasing the share of Black teachers has \"exceptionally large impacts on students' short and long term outcomes,\" he said. \"I'd say some of the largest impacts I've seen across all of the educational intervention literature.\"\nBut maximizing the benefits of a more diverse workforce will be complicated, Blazar said. Even if the state's teacher workforce came to match the demographics of its students, there would likely still be \"clustering of Black teachers within certain districts, and within certain schools within districts,\" he said.\nHansen echoed those concerns, and said that teachers nationwide remain even more racially segregated than students. Rather than aiming to make the teachers within individual districts reflect the exact racial demographics as their students, he suggested that policymakers should \"maximize exposure and access to a diverse set of teachers for every student\" across different regions.\nA work in progressBeyond the Blueprint, the General Assembly last year passed the Maryland Educator Shortage Reduction Act, which requires the state to set recruitment goals for teacher education programs, creates an alternative teacher prep program for early childhood educators and establishes a $20,000 yearly stipend for eligible student teachers.\nGov. Wes Moore, who proposed the legislation, said upon signing it that it is intended to place \"world class teachers in every classroom.\"\nCarpenter, the Charles County teacher, said future changes may be necessary, too.\n\"We will have new students next year, and they will [have] different needs. So we need to make sure that we are constantly evolving,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Sparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George's County, stressed that reinforcing the teacher workforce is key to the Blueprint's overall success.\n\"It lands in the hands of our educators, and if we don't have educators who are highly qualified or able to do the work, then the Blueprint work would never get accomplished,\" she said.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But the thing that got me that I finally said I cannot in any way, shape or form be associated with was at the March 5 meeting.\"\n\"The superintendent called some employees minions. I was like 'did you just say minions? Mindless people who just do what you say?'\" she said.\nThe exchange between Simmons and DiGiacomo, which can be viewed in the recorded meeting on the board's website, resulted from a conversation in which the superintendent discussed the district's upcoming switch from Apple laptops to Google Chrome ones.\nHe talks about how many people it took to get the computers ready for summer.\n\"For getting the devices ready for summer, we don't quite need quite the large numbers of minions, as the devices come in more ready to go out the door. So it helps us on that end as well,\" he said in the meeting.\nDiGiacomo asks, \"Minions?... I guess just the word kind of offends me… 'Minions' offends me. It did offend me.\"\nSimmons said, \"I didn't mean to offend you. I was thinking Minion movies.\"\nMembers of the board laughed.\nShe said, \"A minion is a person that does what they, without thinking. That is all. It is derogatory.\"\nSimmons responded, \"Wasn't meant to be offensive, Mrs. DiGiacomo.\"\nShe said, \"I don't think anyone would be appreciative of that,\" before the board returned to their initial discussion.\nSimmons did not directly respond to a request for comment about the exchange, though the school district did issue a press release following DiGiacomo's resignation.\nDiGiacomo's term was supposed to end Nov. 30. She came to the position after 20 years as a high school English teacher.\n\"The main statement I am trying to make by resigning eight months early is I do not want anyone to think that I condone what is going on,\" she said.\n\"... I am not trying to start trouble. I just want people to know that I really did try my best,\" she said. \"But I can't be a part of something that doesn't respect the employees. Calling people minions is not respectful. I don't want people to think I quit. It is a moral thing for me.\"\n\"I think the people who voted for me have the right to know why I made that decision,\" she said.\nThe Board of Education's statement on the resignation thanks DiGiacomo for her time on the board.\nIn it, Board President Richard Barton stated, \"On behalf of the Caroline County Board of Education, we thank Mrs. DiGiacomo for the time she spent on the board and appreciate her service to the staff and students of Caroline County Public Schools.\"\nThe board also said, \"regarding the vacancy this resignation creates, the board will discuss options as they pertain to Maryland law with the board attorney at their next meeting.\"\nThe next meeting is on April 2 at 6 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In education, tier one instruction is instruction given to the entire classroom.\n\"Right now we see the deficit across the district as it relates to tier one instruction,\" Thompson said. \"And this is the way that we think we're going to improve our tier one instruction, by providing professional development to our leadership.\"\nThompson said the district has to put its money where its mouth is.\n\"We're trying to shift our mindset to put instruction first,\" he said. \"And we believe that this is the way to do it: By training our staff and training our leadership to be instructional leaders.\"\nThompson said Creative Leadership Solutions will cater their services to what the district needs.\nAt a Cambridge City Council meeting later that day, Thompson gave a presentation to the council on the overall picture of the school system where he talked about the need for improving tier one instruction. He spoke about the importance of having a school calendar that allows the district to provide time for professional development.\n\"We can't expect teachers to be good at their craft if we're not continuously training them to be better at their craft,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She became a school librarian 10 years ago and has served as a high school teacher for the past five years. She said she applied for the vacant seat because she saw it as an opportunity to continue to serve the school system.\n\"It is important, with a lot of the things that are coming up for Dorchester County Public Schools, that District 2 has a voice in making those decisions,\" she said. \"Because, by and large, most of the school children in the county are in this district.\"\nIn a press release, the County Council said it believes the board will benefit from Chikwendu's institutional knowledge from working in the district.\nChikwendu was appointed to fill the rest of Theresa Stafford's term, which ends in 2026. Stafford, who was elected to the Board of Education in 2022, passed away in mid-December after battling cancer for several years.\nChikwendu said her first order of business as a board member is to figure out exactly where the district is right now.\n\"I mean at this point in the year, we are in the middle of budget season, we are about to end the school year,\" she said. \"At this point, it's a function of acclimating myself to just what is happening and where I'm needed.\"\nChikwendu said she wants to be of service to the community.

    "content": "Candidates compete for 3 open Dorchester Board of Education seats\n\n April 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 3224\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Dorchester County Board of Education has three position on the ballot this year for Districts 1, 3 and 5. There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 1 and 5 will appear on the ballot of May 14's primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election. The District 3 candidates will not be on the ballot until November, since only two candidates are registered.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the eight candidates competing for the seats to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity and length. Extended versions of these Q&As are available at stardem.com.\nMIKE HARTFORDMike Hartford is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nFirst-hand knowledge from a parent standpoint on current issues. Outside perspective, from not only a parental standpoint, but from a business standpoint. As a small business owner I feel I have the tools necessary to communicate issues effectively and provide reasonable solutions when problems do arise.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nWe need to focus more on our local needs and suggestions, rather than what the state suggests. Our county is run by the students and the parents. The current board needs to be aware of that. It is about the kids, always.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nMaryland's Blueprint itself is a great concept. We need to adapt to these guidelines and utilize the tools and knowledge we have of our local community to expand the idea further. For Instance, teacher incentives, pay raises and teacher appreciation should be at the forefront of our focus. These are the people who guide the students in the right direction. We need to attract the best talent so we can provide the children the best education they can get. Our country's future depends on it.\nCHRISTINE LAMONICAChristine LaMonica is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a prospective member of the Board of Education, I bring a commitment to fostering positive change and ensuring that every student receives the best possible education in a safe environment.\nI bring a true passion for advocacy for our students, families, and educators to ensure that their voices are heard, and their needs are met within our educational system. This will include advocating for resources for all schools regardless of their socioeconomic status or location, as I believe in the power of inclusive education that celebrates diversity and promotes a sense of belonging for every student.\nAs a board member I would promote transparency and collaboration in decision making. I am looking forward to visiting the schools and listening to the needs of each district, I believe that is paramount in understanding the culture of our schools. I recognize that to make progress, the Board functions best when the members work together towards common goals with open communication and respect.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward? How do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nI am going to combine this question along with the question regarding the Blueprint. Overall, the board and district should work together towards the common goal of student safety, success in learning, and wellness for all students first and foremost, the Blueprint hopefully being a roadmap to help us meet certain objectives.\nAs a candidate and community member I see the Blueprint as a \"challenge,\" and one that has the potential to bring good to our schools, albeit nothing is perfect or easy. As a candidate I think the county and the board are addressing the issues of funding and staffing regarding the requirements of the Blueprint and the future of our education system the best they can right now with the resources available to them. The county and the board are going to have to be creative and resilient with the challenges ahead. We aren't alone or singled out in Dorchester County. Larger counties are facing challenges also. They may have more resources to pull from, but larger populations to serve. We all have our specific barriers to overcome. We see this not only in the education system, but in many public service arenas.\nLUCAS THORPELucas Thorpe is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a candidate for the Board of Education, I bring a unique blend of experience, passion, and dedication to student success. Having previously served as a student member on the board, I understand the inner workings of the education system and the challenges that students face firsthand. This experience has equipped me with valuable insights into the needs and aspirations of our student population.\nIn addition to my board experience, my current work in the nonprofit sector serving Dorchester County Public Schools students has further deepened my understanding of the issues affecting our educational system. Through my role, I have developed innovative programs and initiatives aimed at supporting student growth and achievement.\nI am committed to fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and excellence within the board. My goal is to ensure that every decision made reflects a student-first mindset and contributes to the overall improvement of our educational system.\nFurthermore, I am dedicated to promoting innovation and equity in education. I will work tirelessly to advocate for resources and programs that empower all students to reach their full potential, regardless of their background or circumstances.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe goals that the board and district need to be working toward are multifaceted and require a comprehensive approach to address the challenges facing Dorchester County Public Schools. First and foremost, we need to prioritize improving academic outcomes and student achievement. Currently, DCPS is ranked 23 out of 24 systems in the state of Maryland, which is unacceptable. We must work tirelessly to elevate our educational standards and ensure that every student receives a high-quality education that prepares them for success.\nTo achieve this goal, we need to focus on several key areas:\nLeadership and support.Parent and community involvement.Addressing chronic absenteeism.Discipline and behavioral remediation.College and career readiness.\nThe board and district need to prioritize academic excellence, foster parent and community involvement, address chronic absenteeism and discipline issues, and promote college and career readiness.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nAs a law passed in the Maryland State Legislature, my stance on the Blueprint is clear: I fully support its objectives and initiatives.\nNow, the conversation shifts to how our school system will implement and stay on track with what is outlined in the Blueprint.\nOne key aspect of the Blueprint that I strongly endorse is Pillar 2, which focuses on high quality and diverse teachers and leaders. This pillar mandates that local school systems implement new teacher ladders, including a minimum teacher salary of $60,000 by fiscal year 2026. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of partnering with Historically Black Colleges and Universities to increase and support the pipeline of diverse teachers and leaders. Increasing teacher pay is essential for Dorchester to remain competitive and attract top talent to our schools.\nHowever, it's important to note that while I fully support the Blueprint, it is not currently fully funded by the State of Maryland. Despite a budget surplus in fiscal year 2023, the state is projected to face a structural budget deficit of $761 million by fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2024, DCPS received $58,118,000 in direct state funding and $24,006,038 in funding from the county. Historically, our county commissioners have funded education locally at around 0.0-1.0% above the Maintenance of Effort, whereas neighboring Wicomico County funds at roughly 5.0-10.0% above the MOE. As leaders in the school system and the county council, it's imperative that we collaborate to find ways to fully fund initiatives and programming efforts locally.\nSUSAN MORGANSusan Morgan is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Morgan is the current Board of Education vice president.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nRaise the academic performance of all students in every school, with a particular focus on reading and math.Make kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.Reduce chronic absenteeism.Implement an effective alternative education program to address disruptive behavior at every level.Refuse to accept violent behavior by imposing serious and predictable consequences on such behavior.Increase fiscal responsibility and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe Board of Education is directing DCPS to implement the Blueprint requirements within the required timelines. However, sufficient funding to meet these mandated requirements is not being provided by the State of Maryland. Lack of adequate funding will require hard, but informed choices over the next several years. Unless increased funding is provided or implementation deadlines are modified, it may impossible to meet Blueprint requirements going forward.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have worked constructively with all individuals and groups who have the success of our students as their goal. For example, Mike Diaz (2023-24 Board President, 2022-23 Vice President) and I (2022-23 President, 2023-24 Vice President) have markedly different political views, but we have worked extremely well together to generate the constructive change needed for our children to succeed. Actions of the Board under our leadership over the past two years have resulted in the following accomplishments:\nStudent Achievement: The Board is now monitoring student achievement using structured reports prepared by the DCPS Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessments. As a result, we now have reliable data demonstrating that our students' test scores are improving somewhat is some areas.Kindergarten Readiness: Importantly, 42.4% of students enrolled in pre-kindergarten programs demonstrate readiness for kindergarten. Overall Kindergarten readiness has improved with 39% of students demonstrating readiness in Fall of SY2023-2024 (versus 32% in SY2022-2023 and 29% in SY2021-2022).Programs to Address Disruptive Behavior: This year, the Board has finally implemented a structured alternative education program that includes both academic and social/emotional components (with both an on-campus and an off-campus high school program) that is showing measurable results. Functional Family Therapy delivered in the student's home is an important component of this program. A request for proposals to develop and implement similar on-campus programs at the elementary and middle school levels has been posted.Increased Fiscal Responsibility and Accountability: Over the past two years, the Board President and Vice President have initiated increased scrutiny of budget development and detailed justifications of spending requests. The Board now requires that concrete performance and outcome measures be specified for funded programs and for contracts with external organizations. In preparation for SY 2024-25, we are going back to the basics with our budget. Every dollar is being scrutinized, including costs of maintenance, function, administration and teachers. Costs have often been carried over from year-to-year without evaluation.School Safety: School safety has been improved demonstrably. We have supplied all of our secondary schools with weapons detection systems and installed fences around many of our schools. In addition, the board now refuses to accept violent behavior and is willing to impose serious and predictable consequences for violent behavior.Website Redesign: Comments from users indicated that the previous DCPS website failed to provide important information, was difficult to navigate, and lacked effective mechanisms for getting information out to the community. The Board directed DCPS to develop a new website that would incorporate an integrated communication system to address these deficiencies. After much discussion and review, the new website and communication system were installed and became operational this year.Increased Communication with the County Council:The board president and vice president have met regularly with the president and vice president of the County Council to foster an understanding of DCPS needs and programs and to address wider areas of concern, such as juvenile justice challenges.\nMIKE DIAZMike Diaz is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Diaz is the current Board of Education president.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nElection of the right candidates is what will be working toward for the district. The Board members working with the superintendent are highly focused on retention and accountability within the system. As with any large company, or in our case school district, change doesn't occur over night and neither do results. I feel we are moving rapidly in the right direction.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nOur job as the duly elected members to the school district is to govern the district and work with the superintendent. He manages the district and, specifically, the Blueprint requirements. The county government provides us the Maintenance of Effort funding to which we and the superintendent account for in the budget. This funding accounts for roughly 20% of the DCPS budget.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI was elected in 2020 and, shortly after taking office, the pandemic occurred, slowing everything down. That being said, I ran on safety and security and accountability as my main focus. Since then we added a layered security apparatus that involves weapon detection systems, security camera upgrades, security vestibules, etc. We had the superintendent hire a director of security and an assistant superintendent to focus on safety and accountability directly in the schools.\nAlternative Education at the secondary level was something I wanted to ensure was available to the district when these students displayed undesirable behaviors and were, in most cases, sent home or suspended long term. Although DCPS by law still has to provide them educational services, many students never completed those tasks and were in the community being unaccountable. Making the investment in alternative education now ensures that there is a program in place in each high school for students that are experiencing difficulty in their normal setting.\nStudents that are placed on long term suspension are asked to participate in the off-campus alternative education program in Woolford and are there for an average of 44 days. This is in collaboration with the student and the parents. Many of the students are also given the opportunity to participate in the Functional Family Therapy program that is also offered as an intensive in-home wrap-around service.\nI can't think of a better example of the term \"equity\" than this. Providing structural, long-term, evidenced-based services to our most at risk populations.\nThis Board also approved a three year agreement with the educators, increasing their compensation to meet the Blueprint standards.\nThe overall goal is to provide the community the best education possible. DCPS is currently 23 out of 24 in Maryland, something the acting superintendent reminds us of frequently. We didn't get here overnight. I feel more confident that we are charging ahead with the mentality of accountability at all levels. This approach will shape the management and leadership culture in the district and will have a direct effect in the learning process.\nBRANDY DAWSON CUMBERLANDBrandy Dawson Cumberland is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nA fresh perspective as a parent and invested community member, without a private agenda. I have studied and implemented quality initiative projects throughout my doctoral studies. I am serious about safe, evidence-based and data-driven solutions while remembering the uniqueness and diversity of our large school district. Additionally, as a mental health professional, I aim to serve our community, and the future of our community is our children.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nGoals must prioritize safety, transparency, learning, retaining quality educators and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nWhile the Blueprint has been passed at the state level, several districts are in a similar situation to Dorchester. We must continue working with local and state legislators to advocate for resource allocation to allow for implementation.\nCHRIS WEEDLETONChris Wheedleton is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. He is currently serving as District 5 board member.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe board and district leadership established and aligned on a strategic plan last year that lays out clear goals for improvement and growth. Those goals were translated into scorecards and metrics in every area of the strategic plan including academic success, school/family/community partnerships, school safety & climate, high quality workforce and operational efficiency. We have shifted the monthly board meetings to put student outcomes and deliverables in each area at the forefront of what we focus on and post the outcomes on the DCPS website after every meeting to ensure transparency and clarity for all community stakeholders. Continuous improvement in every one of those areas is what the district needs to and is working towards. Check out the plan at: https://www.dcps.k12.md.us/o/dcps/page/parents\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nIn an honest and open way. That includes how we are working to understand and stay compliant with the guidelines that have been and continue to be laid out from the state, which we are currently doing through our Blueprint coordinator, Dr. Boyd. It also includes sharing with all stakeholders what is working and not working for our District and community. There are multiple elements of Blueprint that need to be refined in order for it to help support the unique needs of Dorchester County. The board and superintendent continue to share those with state and local officials so that they understand, from the educator's perspective, what the implementation looks like on the ground. Working together to understand and try to improve what is needed for our county is important. There are positive aspects that have brought resources in the area of workforce development and career planning for students, as well as areas like early childhood that have yet to be structured in ways that work in Dorchester County.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have enjoyed the work of the board and appreciate the feedback I have received that community members have seen my approach as organized and thoughtful to the questions and work that comes before the Board for consideration and action. I am proud to have added value in helping to develop and steer the publicly available Data Dashboard and the process behind it, clearer connections to the business community, and a reinstated CASE Agricultural program at DCTC to ensure that exposure to pathways to success in agriculture remain a viable part of the educational experience for students in our community. One clear goal ahead is the critical work of finding the best next leader of DCPS as part of the superintendent search process that we are currently going through, and I am honored to be helping to lead that process. I would be proud to represent the area of Dorchester County in District 5 that raised me.

There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 3 will not appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The two candidates for the seat will appear on the ballot for the November general election.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the candidates competing for the District 3 seat to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity.\nChristine LaMonica\nChristine LaMonica is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhy are you running?\nAs a parent and a dedicated member of public safety in Dorchester County, I am motivated to address safety concerns in our schools as well advocate for all students to have access to a quality education. As a community we continue to face evolving challenges, these challenges look different in each district. I am prepared to serve our community's public schools and assist in ensuring that the school districts are responsive to these challenges and receptive to the values and priorities of its community members.\nIn addition, as a prospective board member, it is my desire for our children and educators to be set up for success. I plan to use my commitment to public service and my personal and professional experiences to assist with solutions, ideas, and decisions. I firmly believe it is time for Dorchester County Public Schools to start rising to the top and to exceed expectations.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a prospective member of the Board of Education, I bring a commitment to fostering positive change and ensuring that every student receives the best possible education in a safe environment.\nI bring a true passion for advocacy for our students, families, and educators to ensure that their voices are heard, and their needs are met within our educational system. This will include advocating for resources for all schools regardless of their socioeconomic status or location, as I believe in the power of inclusive education that celebrates diversity and promotes a sense of belonging for every student.\nAs a board member I would promote transparency and collaboration in decision making. I am looking forward to visiting the schools and listening to the needs of each district, I believe that is paramount in understanding the culture of our schools. I recognize that to make progress, the Board functions best when the members work together towards common goals with open communication and respect.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nWe have many important issues, all requiring attention. However, as a parent with children in the school system, and as a public safety professional in Dorchester County, I personally believe we need to start our new school year off creating a safer school environment for everyone. Safe schools foster successful learning. This goes beyond more school resource officers and weapon detection systems. This includes addressing the root cause of violence and insecurity in our community by advocating for safe schools with a holistic approach that addresses social, emotional and environmental factors that impact our students.\nThis issue as well as many others require commitment, collaboration (one of my favorite words) and action to ensure our schools are nurturing and safe environments where our students can thrive for success. We can achieve this with more wraparound services and consistency in planning and implementing.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward? How do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nI am going to combine this question along with the question regarding the Blueprint. Overall, the board and district should work together towards the common goal of student safety, success in learning, and wellness for all students first and foremost, the Blueprint hopefully being a roadmap to help us meet certain objectives.\nAs a candidate and community member I see the Blueprint as a \"challenge,\" and one that has the potential to bring good to our schools, albeit nothing is perfect or easy.

The county and the board are going to have to be creative and resilient with the challenges ahead. We aren't alone or singled out in Dorchester County. Larger counties are facing challenges also. They may have more resources to pull from, but larger populations to serve. We all have our specific barriers to overcome. We see this not only in the education system, but in many public service arenas.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nThese numbers tell me that we have work to do. We need those numbers to rise, not only because they are statistics to boast about, but because we want our young students to do well so they can be successful learners. Our educators and support staff that I personally have worked alongside are giving what they can and then some. There is no simple solution, however this is where I think the Blueprint has some promise to help us navigate through some of these difficulties. It just has pieces and parts that are difficult for Dorchester County to achieve for many reasons.\nThe district has its work cut out for it, and so does the board. But as a community, we also have work to do. It takes a village. We need to come together with transparency and a willingness to listen without any personal agendas. As a candidate, I am ready to work with other board members, community leaders and stakeholders to move us forward.\nSusan Morgan\nSusan Morgan is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Morgan is the current Board of Education vice president.\nWhy are you running?\nDriving change has not been easy. More work is needed to bring about the changes that our children need and deserve. DCPS still faces tremendous challenges.\nDCPS students score next-to-last in the State on every academic measure.\nIncoming students lack social, emotional and academic readiness.\nChronic absenteeism remains a significant impediment to achievement.\nDisruptive behavior too often impedes learning and threatens student and teacher safety.\nBudget reductions will require hard, but informed choices over the next several years.\nWithout a strong, improved school system, our community will never attract the young families and businesses that are that are critical to future success.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nMy top priority going forward is to raise the academic performance of all students in every school, with a particular focus on reading and math. The Board is now monitoring student achievement using structured reports prepared by the DCPS Director of Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessments. As a result, we now have reliable data demonstrating that our students' test scores are improving somewhat is some areas. However, unacceptably large percentages of our students in every grade score below grade level in reading and math. Chronic absenteeism remains a significant impediment to achievement. More effective interventions are needed that dedicate time EVERY DAY to reading and math.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nRaise the academic performance of all students in every school, with a particular focus on reading and math.\nMake kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.\nReduce chronic absenteeism.\nImplement an effective alternative education program to address disruptive behavior at every level.\nRefuse to accept violent behavior by imposing serious and predictable consequences on such behavior.\nIncrease fiscal responsibility and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe Board of Education is directing DCPS to implement the Blueprint requirements within the required timelines. However, sufficient funding to meet these mandated requirements is not being provided by the State of Maryland. Lack of adequate funding will require hard, but informed choices over the next several years. Unless increased funding is provided or implementation deadlines are modified, it may impossible to meet Blueprint requirements going forward.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nImportantly, 42.4% of students enrolled in pre-kindergarten programs demonstrate readiness for kindergarten. Overall Kindergarten readiness has improved with 39% of students demonstrating readiness in Fall of SY2023-2024 (versus 32% in SY2022-2023 and 29% in SY2021-2022) We need to make kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have worked constructively with all individuals and groups who have the success of our students as their goal. For example, Mike Diaz (2023-24 Board President, 2022-23 Vice President) and I (2022-23 President, 2023-24 Vice President) have markedly different political views, but we have worked extremely well together to generate the constructive change needed for our children to succeed. Actions of the Board under our leadership over the past two years have resulted in the following accomplishments:\nStudent Achievement.Progress – The Board is now monitoring student achievement using structured reports prepared by the DCPS Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessments. As a result, we now have reliable data demonstrating that our students' test scores are improving somewhat is some areas.Priority – Unacceptably large percentages of our students in every grade score below grade level in reading and math. Chronic absenteeism remains a significant impediment to achievement. More effective interventions are needed.Kindergarten Readiness.Progress – Importantly, 42.4% of students enrolled in pre-kindergarten programs demonstrate readiness for kindergarten. Overall Kindergarten readiness has improved with 39% of students demonstrating readiness in Fall of SY2023-2024 (versus 32% in SY2022-2023 and 29% in SY2021-2022).Priority – We need to make kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.Programs to Address Disruptive Behavior.Progress – This year, the Board has finally implemented a structured alternative education program that includes both academic and social/emotional components (with both an on-campus and an off-campus high school program) that is showing measurable results. Functional Family Therapy delivered in the student's home is an important component of this program. A request for proposals to develop and implement similar on-campus programs at the elementary and middle school levels has been posted.Priority – Implementation of these intervention programs is critical to ensuring students' academic progress and behavioral control. These programs must be flexible enough to address individual student needs, and must be based on a written Functional Behavioral Assessment, supported by a concrete, individualized Behavioral Intervention Plan.Increased Fiscal Responsibility and Accountability.Progress – Over the past two years, the Board President and Vice President have initiated increased scrutiny of budget development and detailed justifications of spending requests. The Board now requires that concrete performance and outcome measures be specified for funded programs and for contracts with external organizations. In preparation for SY 2024-25, we are going back to the basics with our budget. Every dollar is being scrutinized, including costs of maintenance, function, administration and teachers. Costs have often been carried over from year-to-year without evaluation.Priority – The practice of continuing programs without evaluation must stop, and programs that cannot demonstrate effectiveness must be eliminated in favor of programs that can. Budget reductions will require hard, but informed choices going forward.School Safety.Progress – School safety has been improved demonstrably. We have supplied all of our secondary schools with weapons detection systems and installed fences around many of our schools. In addition, the board now refuses to accept violent behavior and is willing to impose serious and predictable consequences for violent behavior.Priority – Violent students may be offered appropriate voluntary educational programs outside DCPS, but violence can not be accepted on any DCPS campus. Consequences for violent behavior must continue to be clear and consistently enforced.Website Redesign.Progress – Comments from users indicated that the previous DCPS website failed to provide important information, was difficult to navigate, and lacked effective mechanisms for getting information out to the community. The Board directed DCPS to develop a new website that would incorporate an integrated communication system to address these deficiencies. After much discussion and review, the new website and communication system were installed and became operational this year.Priority – The website must be maintained and updated in a timely and user-friendly manner.Increased Communication with the County Council.Progress – The board president and vice president have met regularly with the president and vice president of the County Council to foster an understanding of DCPS needs and programs and to address wider areas of concern, such as juvenile justice challenges.Priority – Increased communication with the County Council must be maintained and strengthened. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Three candidates compete for District 5 Dorchester Board of Education seat\n\n May 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Dorchester County Board of Education has three position on the ballot this year for Districts 1, 3 and 5. There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 5 will appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election in November.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the candidates competing for the District 5 seat to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity.\nChris Wheedleton\nChris Wheedleton is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. He is currently serving as District 5 board member.\nWhy are you running?\nI was honored to be appointed last year by the County Council to represent District 5, based on the experiences and skills that I have built working in education and workforce development innovations across the country over the last several decades. I have enjoyed the process of collaborating with the board and community stakeholders to align our resources and find solutions to improve opportunities and outcomes for our students, educators and schools. I feel like I have added value and see the opportunity to help make further improvements. I would like to continue that work for a full term.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThere are many needs and challenges that we face as a community and school district. Among the most important issues currently is the need to have a clear sense for where we are and where we need to go as a school system, and a consistent culture across the system and in each school for accountability and working together to find the best solutions. The current process for finding the best next leader for DCPS is an important part of that, and the board is starting with direct engagement with the community to get the voice of all stakeholders as part of this process. I believe that having a culture that brings all resources that we have as a collective community to help create the best conditions for our students to find success, is among the most important issues we face right now and into the future.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe board and district leadership established and aligned on a strategic plan last year that lays out clear goals for improvement and growth. Those goals were translated into scorecards and metrics in every area of the strategic plan including academic success, school/family/community partnerships, school safety & climate, high quality workforce and operational efficiency. We have shifted the monthly board meetings to put student outcomes and deliverables in each area at the forefront of what we focus on and post the outcomes on the DCPS website after every meeting to ensure transparency and clarity for all community stakeholders. Continuous improvement in every one of those areas is what the district needs to and is working towards. Check out the plan at: https://www.dcps.k12.md.us/o/dcps/page/parents\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nIn an honest and open way. That includes how we are working to understand and stay compliant with the guidelines that have been and continue to be laid out from the state, which we are currently doing through our Blueprint coordinator, Dr. Boyd. It also includes sharing with all stakeholders what is working and not working for our District and community. There are multiple elements of Blueprint that need to be refined in order for it to help support the unique needs of Dorchester County. The board and superintendent continue to share those with state and local officials so that they understand, from the educator's perspective, what the implementation looks like on the ground. Working together to understand and try to improve what is needed for our county is important. There are positive aspects that have brought resources in the area of workforce development and career planning for students, as well as areas like early childhood that have yet to be structured in ways that work in Dorchester County.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nThere are so many positive improvements happening across our community, and the collective impact of community partners is starting show real results, in concert with the leadership of DCPS. It is no accident that the timing of these improvements comes in the second year of a 10 year comprehensive plan as part of the Campaign for Grade-Level Reading that was started in Dorchester County by a wide range of community partners. This has included nonprofits, business partners and action agencies including Moving Dorchester Forward, the Health Department, the Chamber of Commerce, the library system, the YMCA, Boys & Girls Clubs and United Way. Much of this was started through the leadership of the John & Janice Wyatt Foundation. DCPS is a key leader in this effort through the Early Childhood Advisory Council. The more that we can bring EVERYONE together in this collective effort, the more we will see continued progress. Learn more at: https://www.dorchestercglr.com/\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have enjoyed the work of the board and appreciate the feedback I have received that community members have seen my approach as organized and thoughtful to the questions and work that comes before the Board for consideration and action. I am proud to have added value in helping to develop and steer the publicly available Data Dashboard and the process behind it, clearer connections to the business community, and a reinstated CASE Agricultural program at DCTC to ensure that exposure to pathways to success in agriculture remain a viable part of the educational experience for students in our community. One clear goal ahead is the critical work of finding the best next leader of DCPS as part of the superintendent search process that we are currently going through, and I am honored to be helping to lead that process. I would be proud to represent the area of Dorchester County in District 5 that raised me. I welcome anyone who wants to learn more to check out my website at: https://skillsgap.org/welcome\nMike Hartford\nMike Hartford is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhy are you running?\nMy main focus is keeping our current schools in place. The last few years have been challenging for the current students, board and parents. We need to be sure parents have a true say in what is happening and a place to have their questions answered. I'm running to bring transparency to the current issues at hand and to keep the parents well informed in not only our district, but our county. Its time the younger generation stands up and starts making the changes they wish to see.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nFirst-hand knowledge from a parent standpoint on current issues. Outside perspective, from not only a parental standpoint, but from a business standpoint. As a small business owner I feel I have the tools necessary to communicate issues effectively and provide reasonable solutions when problems do arise.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe infrastructure of certain schools. We need to explore all options that work for the parents, not just the budget. We have schools that have been standing in low-lying areas creating common problems that if fixed, could potentially save the small communities around them. These communities make our county great, if we remove the school(s), we not only face logistical nightmares for parents, grandparents and siblings. We need reasonable solutions that the parents of the students who attend the schools can come to an agreement on.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nWe need to focus more on our local needs and suggestions, rather than what the state suggests. Our county is run by the students and the parents. The current board needs to be aware of that. It is about the kids, always.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nMaryland's Blueprint itself is a great concept. We need to adapt to these guidelines and utilize the tools and knowledge we have of our local community to expand the idea further. For Instance, teacher incentives, pay raises and teacher appreciation should be at the forefront of our focus. These are the people who guide the students in the right direction. We need to attract the best talent so we can provide the children the best education they can get. Our country's future depends on it.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nWhile trending in the right direction, we need to keep the momentum. Providing parents of toddlers and childcare workers educational supplies and online classes to further their skills could potentially be beneficial. The parents/daycare providers could use these supplies/skills to ensure our young children are mentally, physically and emotionally ready for their big transition. The current pk-3 option we are bringing into the 2024-2025 school year is a great idea, but at what expense?\nJerome Harris\nJerome Harris is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Harris did not respond to the candidate questions. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

There are currently six candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Talbot Public Schools.Candidates in District 2 will appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election. The Districts 5 and 6 candidates will not be on the ballot until November, since no more than two candidates are registered in those races.\nEach position will serve a four-year term beginning in Dec. 1, 2024, and ending in Dec.1, 2028.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the eight candidates competing for the seats to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity and length. Extended versions of the candidates' Q&As can be found at stardem.com.\nCANDACE HENRY\nCandace Henry is running for the District 2 Board of Education seat. She is currently on the Board of Education.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nSeveral very important issues face Talbot County Public Schools. One key issue is the recruitment and retention of diverse teachers and administrators.\nAs a board, we should continue and enhance our efforts to create a welcoming and supportive work environment, offer competitive compensation, increase opportunities for high-quality professional development, prioritize work-life balance, and recognize the value of all educators.\nAnother important issue is the opportunity gap. To address the opportunity gap, it is important to continue our multi-faceted approach to advancing equity throughout TCPS. Examples include resource allocation, targeted support for underserved communities, access to challenging courses for all students, data-informed decision-making, community engagement, and recruiting diverse educators.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe implementation of the Blueprint involves careful planning, collaboration with stakeholders, and a focus on equity. Additionally, TCPS leadership should continue efforts to regularly communicate with our local community and stakeholders on the progress and updates related to implementation planning.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nEach year, the board and district meet to identify and align our goals with the district's strategic planning initiatives. The board and district should continue to work toward several overarching goals to effectively improve educational experiences and outcomes for all students.\nWe should continue to ensure that all students have equitable access to high-quality education, regardless of their background, socioeconomic status, race, or ability. This includes addressing disparities in resources, opportunities, and outcomes among student populations.\nThe board and district should continue to set ambitious goals that focus on improving student achievement, closing achievement gaps, increasing proficiency levels in core subjects, and preparing students for post-secondary education and/or career success.\nWhy are you running?\nI currently serve on the TCPS School Board, a position I've been proud to hold for the last 4 years. I am inspired by my personal experiences as a student in Talbot County Public Schools and am a proud alumna of Easton High School.\nI am also a mother of two TCPS students. My grandmother's legacy as a TCPS educator has instilled in me a profound passion for education, which has fueled my dedication to serving on the Board of Education.\nI witnessed my grandmother go above and beyond for her students and work tirelessly in our community to help others. Her work inspired and shaped the mother, advocate, wife, community leader, and professional that I am today.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nI bring over 20 years of advocacy experience and a deep commitment to public education to the Board of Education.\nRegarding my professional background, I am currently the director of the Disability Resource Center at Salisbury University, where I am responsible for the oversight and coordination of all operational, administrative, budgetary, personnel, outreach, and assessment activities for students with disabilities.\nAdditionally, I am an adjunct professor in the College of Health and Human Services, where I co-developed and teach in the university's first disability studies minor.\nData is showing a lack of kindergarten preparedness since the pandemic. What do you feel needs to be done to help young students catch up to pre-pandemic numbers?\nTCPS's commitment to engaging families as partners in their children's education has been critical to the goal of improving kindergarten preparedness. I am in support of expanding access to high-quality early childhood education programs, including pre-kindergarten and Head Start programs, especially for children from historically-excluded backgrounds.\nThese programs can provide a strong foundation for academic and social-emotional development before kindergarten. Additionally, extended learning opportunities, such as summer and afterschool programs, can also provide complimentary academic support and enrichment experiences for young students.\nWe should also continue to establish systems for ongoing data monitoring and assessment to track students' progress in kindergarten preparedness and adjust strategies as needed. Using data to identify areas of improvement and allocate resources strategically to support student success.\nOver the past decade, Talbot County elementary schools have seen a rise in Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language. What would you suggest or hope to do to better accommodate these students?\nI support TCPS's continued efforts to increase and strengthen support for our Hispanic and ELL students.\nTo better accommodate Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language in Talbot County elementary schools, it's essential to implement strategies that foster a supportive and inclusive learning environment while addressing student needs.\nSuch strategies include establishing strong partnerships with Hispanic families and community organizations, increasing outreach initiatives, incorporating culturally responsive teaching practices, and expanding support services to include topics related to academic support, cultural integration, and navigating the school system.\nCYNTHIA JURRIUS\nCynthia Jurrius is running for the District 6 Board of Education seat.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most significant issues facing Talbot County Public Schools are interrelated:\nStudent mastery of essential knowledge and skills.Retention, recruitment, and support of excellent teachers.Positive, safe, effective, inclusive school climate for all learners.Family and student engagement.\nAlthough test scores are not always indicative of a student's mastery of the subject matter, statewide and local assessments indicate that many of our TCPS students are not yet achieving grade level standards in essential subjects.\nOne of the most significant indicators for student success is an effective teacher, and, like the rest of the nation, Talbot faces significant teacher shortages.\nA positive, safe, effective, and inclusive school climate is fundamental for student success, as well as teacher retention. Finding innovative ways to engage families, including non English speakers, and students will support all aspects of student success.\nThe current board and superintendent are making progress toward addressing these issues despite many challenges, such as the learning gap caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through additional instructional support, expanding use of innovative community partnerships, strategic use of technology, targeted allocation of resources, and engaging all sectors of our community, I believe that working together we can accelerate progress in these areas.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling the Blueprint?\nThe board, Superintendent (Sharon) Pepukayi and team have a detailed plan for managing the Blueprint. I commend the transparency with which they are approaching this massive undertaking, providing regular reports on Blueprint progress for public review.\nThere are areas of the Blueprint that Talbot was already doing well and new areas that are now required to be addressed. There are many aspects of the Blueprint that are positive. However, the most challenging aspects of the Blueprint in Talbot are state mandates without sufficient funding.\nI would support continued efforts to address the state funding formula as it has been applied to Talbot County.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nAs stated in the TCPS FY 23 Annual Report, the board and superintendent have identified the following goals:\n\"Academic Equity and Achievement; increasing student mastery of grade level/course mathematics standards as measured by local assessments and MCAP measures.\nFostering an Engaging Environment; create and maintain a supportive environment that engages all students and staff.\nHiring and Retaining Highly Qualified and Diverse Staff. Recruit, hire, retain, and promote highly qualified and diverse staff.\"\nI support these goals — innovative, collaborative solutions are needed to accomplish the goals.\nWhy are you running?\nOur public schools play a pivotal role in shaping our community's future, and we need community members on our board who can help move Talbot County Public Schools forward to excellence.\nI serve to make a difference, I care about kids, and I have skills and experience to contribute. I would listen to all perspectives and value the richness in diversity of opinion.\nI am a natural collaborator, skilled at helping people work together to find solutions to challenging community problems. I am also willing to speak up and ask tough questions when necessary.\nI want to ensure that our Talbot Board of Education continues to function effectively and that the polarization that has infected many school districts stays out of our community. We have many strengths on which to build, and together we can solve any challenge.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a seasoned community leader and mediator, I am committed to fostering an inclusive environment where all perspectives are heard, valued, and considered.\nThrough my community involvement; career as an attorney, community mediator, former director of a local nonprofit; and in my current role, I have honed the skills necessary to navigate complex community challenges.\nAs director of youth and family services for Mid Shore Community Mediation, and later as executive director, I launched the implementation of school-based programs focused on conflict resolution, leveraging limited resources for successful outcomes for students.\nI thrive on the challenge of collaborating with diverse stakeholders to uncover innovative solutions that benefit all parties involved. As the parent of three TCPS graduates, I understand the importance of advocating for policies and initiatives that prioritize the well-being and academic success of every student.\nAs a family member of educators and school administrators, I bring a multifaceted understanding of the educational landscape. We have many good things to celebrate in the Talbot County Public Schools — a great foundation of caring and skilled teachers, experienced administrators, an effective Board, and fantastic kids.\nI am dedicated to listening, collaborating, and working hard to ensure that our schools continue to evolve and thrive for the benefit of our entire community.\nData is showing a lack of kindergarten preparedness since the pandemic. What do you feel needs to be done to help young students catch up to pre-pandemic numbers?\nTCPS is currently implementing aspects of the Blueprint that provide for expanded pre-K, to support improved kindergarten readiness in the future.\nAdditionally, these students are now moving through the elementary grades, and students at other grade levels also have a pandemic learning gap. The existence of the gap needs to be recognized and addressed at all grade levels.\nAt the elementary, middle school, and high school levels, additional math coaches, use of differentiated self-paced technology, and additional instructional aides could be beneficial, including bi-lingual math and language coaches.\nIt is essential to meet students where they are, so that students who need support are not left behind, and those who are ready to excel have that opportunity.\nOver the past decade, Talbot County elementary schools have seen a rise in Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language. What would you suggest or hope to do to better accommodate these students?\nProviding an inclusive environment that supports all learners is important at all grade levels, and students who are not yet proficient in English come into TCPS at all grade levels.\nIt is essential for students at all grade levels to receive support to achieve English language proficiency, as well as support in other subject areas. The types of support for young learners, who are emerging readers, may differ from those for older students.\nThere is considerable research available about working with emerging language learners at all grade levels, and as a Board member, I would look for the best evidenced-based approaches.\nIn addition to providing additional bi-lingual instructional aides in classrooms, math and language coaching, and other direct supports for ESOL students, working with community organizations and community partners to engage these students and their families could be beneficial.\nANNA HOWIE\nAnna Howie is running for the District 5 Board of Education seat. She currently serves on the Talbot County Board of Education.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now is providing exceptional education opportunities for all students while being fiscally responsible.\nCurrently, the curriculum coordinating committee has brought high quality resources to the board for approval in the areas of reading and mathematics. These resources are paid for through educational grants.\nUtilizing grants is a responsible way of ensuring that we are providing our students with high quality instructional materials while being fiscally responsible.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future is designed to improve the quality of education for all children in Maryland and is law. We must ensure that our plan is attainable to meet the goals of the five pillars.\nTalbot County Public Schools and the Board of Education worked in collaboration to create three goals to serve serve serve as the priorities for this school year.\nThe goals include ensuring that we recruit and retain a high quality and diverse staff, increase and improve our mathematics Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program (MCAP) scores, and ensure that our schools are safe. These goals directly align with the pillars of the Blueprint.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nTalbot County Public Schools and the Board have been working toward three goals which are recruiting and retaining a high quality and diverse staff, increasing and improving our mathematics MCAP scores, and ensuring that our schools are safe.\nTCPS and the Board of Education are on target with the three identified goals that we are working towards that align with the needs of the school system, as identified through stakeholder surveys, as well as the Blueprint. TCPS will continue to work collaboratively with stakeholders to continuously improve and meet the needs of our community.\nWhy are you running?\nI am running for a position on the Talbot County Board of Education because not only am I a product of public-school education, I come from a long line of educators and education is my passion.\nMy grandfather was the industrial arts teacher at Moton High School and Easton High School. My mother was a teacher at Easton Middle School, as well as an elementary school teacher in Michigan and Florida.\nMy husband has worked as a special education teacher, assistant principal, principal (Easton High School), and now currently services as the director of student services in Dorchester County. My daughter is a fifth-grade elementary school teacher.\nEducation is extremely important to me and my family, and we have made it our mission to ensure that all students receive a high-quality education.\nStudents deserve to learn in a safe and nurturing environment that allows them to discover their strengths and develop skills that will ensure that they grow to be lifelong learners and productive citizens.\nAs a board member, I want to ensure that our students are safe, healthy and successful. Teachers should be compensated at a wage that respects their professional position and levels of education.\nCommunity stakeholders should be reassured that the students from our school system are provided with the best education and are college and career ready when they graduate from high school. As a member of the board, I will make it my job to do what is necessary for all of our students to succeed.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nI bring to the Talbot County board more than 20 years of public-school experience.\nMy career in education has progressed from being a teacher to an instructional mathematics coach, human resource administrator, local accountability coordinator, curriculum supervisor for mathematics and career and technical education, and a principal.\nI have learned so much from the various roles that I have had the privilege of working in over the years. I work collaboratively with my colleagues, and the Board of Education is a team that works collaboratively to ensure that we achieve our educational goals.\nI bring respect, leadership and the ability to listen which are all essential to ensuring that our collaboration is productive for our students' success.\nData is showing a lack of kindergarten preparedness since the pandemic. What do you feel needs to be done to help young students catch up to pre pandemic numbers?\nKindergarten preparedness is important, and by providing pre-K to our students, Talbot County Public Schools is taking the initiative to ensure that our students are ready for kindergarten. I will make sure that we are working to start our students on the right path to academic achievement.\nOver the past decade, Talbot County elementary schools have seen a rise in Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language. What would you suggest or hope to do to better accommodate these students?\nTalbot County Public Schools welcomes all students and now that we are seeing a rise in our Hispanic student population, we are ensuring that we have the appropriate staffing to accommodate our students.\nThis includes making sure that we have the appropriate number of English language teachers and instructional assistants in our schools.\nThe funding formula that has been the guiding principle in our budget mandates that resources are aligned to each school's need.\nThis includes ensuring that funding is available for all students identified within specific student populations. I will work to ensure that all students receive the education and accommodations that they need to succeed.\nOTHER CANDIDATES\nKerry Gunshenan, District 6, is also running for a position on the Board of Education.

    "date": "2024-05-05",
    "author": "Jim Johnson",
    "content": "Moms For Liberty fields candidates in elections\n\n May 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM JOHNSON | Section: Columns \n \n 1066\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Voters need to know that three candidates for the Talbot County Board of Education are backed by Moms For Liberty, a group that has raised questions across the country and stirred controversy with its views.I don't think it was a coincidence that none of the three candidates — Ann C. O'Connor in District 2, Karla Wieland-Cherry in District 5 and Kerry Gunshenan in District 6 — submitted a questionnaire the Star Democrat sent to candidates seeking their opinions on why they are running for the Board of Education and their stances on various issues.\nOther candidates in the race submitted the questionnaires and their answers were published in the newspaper this week. This is a common practice in elections to give voters insight into how to cast their ballot.\nThe Associated Press, in a July 2023 story, described Moms For Liberty as a \"parental rights\" group that has sought to take over school boards in multiple states.\nThe group has been accused of harassing community members, advancing anti-LGBTQ+ misinformation and fighting to scrub diverse and inclusive material from lesson plans, according to the AP story.\nMoms for Liberty advocates for various conservative causes in education, such as opposing critical race theory and advocating for school choice. They often mobilize parents to attend school board meetings, petition policymakers, and advocate for changes in curriculum and policies.\nWhether Moms for Liberty poses a threat is a matter of perspective.\nSupporters argue that they are exercising their democratic rights to advocate for their beliefs and values, particularly in education, where they feel their voices have been marginalized.\nCritics raise concerns about the group's impact on public education, the potential for polarization within communities, and whether their advocacy could lead to the undermining of public institutions and democratic processes.\n\"'Parental rights' is an appealing term, but voters have caught on to the reality that it is fueling book bans, anti-LGBT efforts, pressure on teachers not to discuss race and gender, whitewashing history, and so on,\" said political analyst Larry Sabato, a politics professor at the University of Virginia and founder and director of the Center for Politics, who was quoted in a November Washington Post article. \"Parents may want more input in the schools, but as a group they certainly aren't as extreme as many in the Moms for Liberty.\"\nHere in Talbot County, I wish the local candidates had taken the time to write about their stances on issues. There is no doubt that there will be voters in Talbot County who agree with them. In some districts, that may be a majority. Yet few people know what these candidates stand for.\nThe fortunate thing: Due to only two candidates running in each district, all of these candidates will be on the ballot again in November. Only District 2 will be on the May 14 primary ballot. In that district, three candidates will be listed, but Connie Loveland said that she has withdrawn from the race, albeit too late to have her name removed from the ballot.\nThe November election will give these candidates another opportunity to tell voters what they stand for. I hope they take it. Before voters cast their ballots, they deserve to know where candidates stand.\nTalbot County this week celebrated the businesses that keep our region's economy thriving. It was an inspirational event.\n\"Our goal is to connect the business community with resources that will help them succeed and grow, and to tell the stories of business leaders who are doing extraordinary things,\" said Cassandra Vanhooser, director of Talbot County's Department of Economic Development and Tourism.\nBefore the awards, Chris Pilkerton, former acting administrator and general legal counsel for the U.S. Small Business Administration, talked about the value of small businesses in the county. He should know. His wife, Amanda Cook, owns the Tilghman Island Baking Company in Tilghman where the couple live.\n\"Talbot County's small business community actively seeks out ways to work together to support each other and their businesses,\" Pilkerton said. \"That type of environment creates real opportunities for new and existing companies.\"\nHe praised the county's economic development efforts.\n\"I have had the opportunity to travel through many states and counties throughout the country and meet directly with local economic development officials,\" he said. \"In my experience, the team within Talbot County is uniquely supportive of their small businesses and is accessible to help with so many topics as they come up.\"\nPilkerton is right. The team led by Cassandra Vanhooser continues to provide much needed support for businesses both small and large in Talbot County. We are lucky to have such talent here.\nA Washington Post story this week showed alarming data for the Eastern Shore, sea levels are rising quickly along the Gulf coast and Atlantic seaboard. The story documented the change in coastal sea levels between 2010 and 2023, in some cases more than 8 inches in the past 14 years.\n\"Since 2010, it's very abnormal and unprecedented,\" said Jianjun Yin, a climate scientist at the University of Arizona who has studied the changes. While it is possible the swift rate of sea level rise could eventually taper, the higher water that has already arrived in recent years is here to stay.\n\"It's irreversible,\" he said in the story.\nThe study included Cambridge, which has seen a 2.8-inch sea level rise since 2010. That was the only Eastern Shore community listed in the story.\nThis increase should not be a surprise to people in the area. A friend with a home on the Choptank River in Cambridge has pumped out his basement multiple times this year, not due to heavy rains but because of high tides.\nJust over a week ago, Oxford announced a pair of federal grants to address the rising sea levels. One grant of $2.6 million is to raise 14 Oxford homes. Residents in those homes agreed to covering 10% of the cost for their home to be elevated. The other 90% of the cost will be paid by the federal government. Lewis said one of those 14 homes is currently being elevated.\nCommission President Tom Costigan turned to the residents in the room, \"I hope you all appreciate just how gigantic this is.\"\nMany towns on the Eastern Shore are taking steps to deal with this problem. As shown by the sea level increases reported in this week's Washington Post story, there is no time to waste.\nJim Johnson is the Star Democrat executive editor.

    "author": "Aidan Hughes and Daranee Balachandar Capital News Service",
    "content": "Will plan for better pay ease teacher shortage?\n\n May 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AIDAN HUGHES and DARANEE BALACHANDAR Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 911\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fifth-grade teacher Melissa Carpenter works a 10-hour day on average during the week, and her job sometimes requires her to put in hours on weekends, too.\"I feel like teaching is one of those jobs where we go to work to do more work — to do work after work,\" said Carpenter, who teaches at William B. Wade Elementary School in Waldorf in Charles County.\nCarpenter's long hours are far from unique among Maryland's educators, as the state and nation grapple with a teacher shortage.\nThe U.S. Department of Education keeps a Teacher Shortage Areas database — and it found that for the current school year, Maryland was short of teachers in 28 subjects, which the state defines as \"areas of certification.\" That's up from 17 five years earlier. Some teacher certification areas — such as English as a second language, health science and special education — are short on teachers from pre-K through the 12th grade.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future – a landmark state law reforming public education — aims to fix that problem by \"elevating the stature of the teaching profession\" through higher pay, better training and stronger recruitment efforts.\nHowever, experts and educators have mixed views about whether that will successfully address the root causes of the shortage.\n\"Money is a huge help, but it's not everything,\" said Simon Birenbaum, director of grading, assessment and scheduling at Baltimore City Public Schools. \"Human capital is the biggest issue, and money can help with that problem, but recruiting, training and retaining high-quality teachers and staff has to be the primary focus. No amount of money can compensate for a lack of highly-skilled educators.\"\nDOCUMENTING THE SHORTAGE\nMaryland's teacher woes follow national trends. The National Center for Education Statistics reported 86% of U.S. K-12 public schools faced challenges in hiring teachers for the current school year.\nAmid the shortage, the Blueprint calls for hiring an unspecified number of additional teachers to ease the workload of classroom veterans.\n\"You hear a lot about the teacher shortage — and how are we going to implement all these Blueprint programs, which require additional staffing, when we have a teacher shortage?\" asked Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\nShortages stem, in part, from the fact that teachers are leaving the profession. In Prince George's County, 1,126 teachers resigned between July 2022 and July 2023 — up from 989 the previous year, The Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, 625 resigned in Montgomery County Public Schools, up from 576 a year earlier.\nDorchester County experienced the highest attrition rate in Maryland during the 2021-22 school year at 18%, according to a Department of Education report.\n\"I used to never have people just quit in the middle of the year,\" said Dorchester County Superintendent Dave Bromwell, who recently retired. \"The pandemic told some people, you know what? If you're not happy, move on.\"\nAll those factors end up impacting teachers like Carpenter. She said her grade level saw an influx of students, with around 30 students in her own fifth grade class this year.\n\"Our class sizes are growing, and we don't have the support in place to help some of our struggling learners,\" she said.\nBLUEPRINT PAY BUMP\nIn order to address the teacher shortage, the Blueprint provides a number of measures that lawmakers hope will encourage people to become teachers and ensure that existing ones don't leave for more lucrative out-of-state positions – or exit the profession altogether.\nA key Blueprint initiative increases teacher pay to a minimum of $60,000 by 2026. In some counties, that means a nearly $15,000 pay bump for new teachers.\nDavid Larner, chief human resource and professional development officer at the Howard County Public School System, said the pay raise will attract teachers from other states and build up Maryland's teacher workforce.\n\"If our salaries are higher than salaries in surrounding states … then candidates are more likely to come,\" Larner said.\nHowever, Hansen, of the Brookings Institution, expressed skepticism about the likely impact of the measure on the state's teacher shortage.\nHansen argued that rather than a universal rise in minimum salary levels, money should be targeted where it's needed the most – attracting teacher talent in high-need schools and specialized fields like STEM subjects and special education. He also highlighted research that suggests salary is just one of many factors that can lead to teacher attrition.\n\"I think we need to be paying teachers more – I don't think paying a $60,000 minimum wage is the way to do it,\" he said.\nWORK IN PROGRESS\nBeyond the Blueprint, the General Assembly last year passed the Maryland Educator Shortage Reduction Act, which requires the state to set recruitment goals for teacher education programs, creates an alternative teacher prep program for early childhood educators and establishes a $20,000 yearly stipend for eligible student teachers.\nGov. Wes Moore, who proposed the legislation, said upon signing it that it is intended to place \"world-class teachers in every classroom.\"\nCarpenter, the Charles County teacher, said future changes may be necessary, too.\n\"We will have new students next year, and they will [have] different needs. So we need to make sure that we are constantly evolving,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Sparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George's County, stressed that reinforcing the teacher workforce is key to the Blueprint's overall success.\n\"It lands in the hands of our educators, and if we don't have educators who are highly qualified or able to do the work, then the Blueprint work would never get accomplished,\" she said.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "School officials: Blueprint money is not enough\n\n May 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: OLIVIA BORGULA and OLIVIA YASHAROFF Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1614\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n You might think spending $16.6 billion more in state funds from 2024 through 2029 — and billions more after that — would be enough to give Maryland a world-class education system. But that's not what many people at the state's local school districts think.For proof, look at what local district leaders said in March when they updated state officials on efforts to implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's landmark effort to rebuild its public schools.\n\"The funding provided under the Blueprint is not sufficient to meet all of the requirements,\" officials in the Baltimore City Public School System wrote.\n\"Blueprint funding tied to specific programs for expansion requires the elimination of other programs and supports,\" the St. Mary's County Public School System's report said.\nMeanwhile, in Kent County, school officials bemoaned that the district will see increased costs related to staffing, data systems, student support and transportation.\n\"KCPS has found that many of the requirements of the Blueprint come without subsequent funding sources to sufficiently cover full implementation,\" district officials wrote.\nCreated by legislation passed by the General Assembly in 2021, the Blueprint is built on five pillars: expanding pre-K to all 4-year-olds and low-income 3-year-olds, improving the teacher workforce, changing curriculums statewide to prepare students for college and careers, expanding funding and setting up a state agency to oversee it all.\nBut in those March updates, 15 of the state's 24 school districts listed funding or resource allocations among the three central challenges they face under the Blueprint.\nMeanwhile, some county officials — such as Harford County Executive Bob Cassilly — say the Blueprint is unaffordable.\n\"Unrealistic state spending mandates for the Blueprint for Education are straining local budgets statewide and should be paused and revisited,\" Cassilly said as he unveiled the county's latest budget April 15.\nNEW MANDATESWhile dramatically boosting state funding for public education over a decade, the Blueprint asks local school districts — and taxpayers — to do their part. And that is causing some concern among the state's school principals, said Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\n\"In education, one thing that sometimes happens is we get unfunded mandates, and unfunded mandates are very challenging,\" Kaufman said at a principals conference late last year.\nCounty leaders find the mandates challenging, too. In a letter to Gov. Wes Moore — a Democrat and strong supporter of the Blueprint — the Maryland Association of Counties last November listed a litany of concerns. They said the Blueprint's cost estimates don't take into account the bottom-line local impact of several major spending items, including:\nConstruction costs for additional classrooms needed under the plan's expansion of pre-K.Classroom modifications to accommodate instructional changes called for under the Blueprint plan to expand career and technical education.Additional staffing for special education students and English language learners.The new minimum $60,000 teacher salary starting in 2026 and other efforts to construct a \"career ladder\" for Maryland teachers.\nNoting that local education funding has already reached all-time highs, the Maryland Association of Counties said: \"This record county funding, combined with greater funding requirements mandated by the law, will limit counties' ability to fund competing governmental needs at basic operational levels.\"\nThe Blueprint's burden on local school districts is only beginning to be felt. By 2034, local school districts will be expected to pay $700 million more annually than they would if the Blueprint hadn't been adopted, a 2022 state report projected.\n\"As the Blueprint ramps up and the formulas increase, more and more counties will have to put more funds in because the local share will increase,\" said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board, the statewide agency created to oversee the Blueprint. \"We're just in the early first couple of years of Blueprint implementation. So it's only four or five counties that are required to put in more than they have been. But over time, it will be more than half of them.\"\nTROUBLE IN COUNTIESTo hear county officials tell it, though, the Blueprint's mandates are already leaving them in a pinch.\nWhen the Blueprint began its rollout, Dorchester County saw a $3 million jump in local funding contributions, according to County Council President Lenny Pfeffer.\n\"That $3 million jump was devastating to us,\" Pfeffer said. \"We had to pull from every resource and cut some programs that we wanted to do as far as highway maintenance, bridge maintenance and other things like that.\"\nMeanwhile in Cecil County, a school funding battle tied in part to the Blueprint led to the creation of a Facebook group — Fund CCPS — with 6,700 members.\nCecil County Executive Danielle Hornberger, a Republican, has refused to meet the school district's funding request. And last month, Hornberger filed an ethics complaint against Cecil County Schools Superintendent Jeffrey Lawson, accusing him of using public property and funds for political purposes in the budget battle.\n\"CCPS families deserve better,\" Hornberger said.\nThat prompted an angry response from Allison Stoudt, the Rising Sun High School senior who founded the Fund CCPS Facebook group. Noting that the county has funded local schools \"at the legal minimum\" for three years running and that its current budget proposal falls $13 million short of the $17 million in additional local aid the district is seeking, Stoudt called Hornberger's accusation against Lawson \"shameful.\"\nIn Worcester County, the county government has similarly refused to increase school funding above the state requirement minimums, leading to a $9 million cash shortfall that could force the district to trim between 90 and 100 staff positions.\n\"It is WCPS' belief that drastically cutting instructional staff runs contrary to the spirit of the Blueprint's goals of continual improvement and transformation in education,\" district officials said in their March Blueprint update.\nSHIFTING RESOURCESThe Blueprint calls for shifting resources within school districts at the expense of other schools.\nCarroll County Public Schools Superintendent Cynthia McCabe explained the potential ramifications of that change at a public meeting in Sykesville last year.\n\"What I don't want to be is a fearmonger, but I also don't want to get to September of 2024 and have parents calling me saying, 'Why are the class sizes so much bigger in my child's school this year?'\" McCabe said during the presentation.\nThe Blueprint shifts funding to higher-need schools in several ways.\nThe education reform plan provides \"concentration of poverty\" grants to some schools to bolster support for academics, extracurriculars, and mental and physical health. Grants are given to schools based on the number of students receiving free and reduced-price meals. In this fiscal year, 454 schools in Maryland received concentration of poverty grants, with just over one- fourth given to schools in Baltimore City.\n\"Especially the community where I serve within my district, they've benefited greatly from having concentrations of poverty funding,\" said Ashley Moore, principal at the Empowerment Academy, a charter school in Baltimore City.\nIn addition, a new requirement under the Blueprint requires students who qualify for Medicaid to automatically be enrolled in free and reduced-price school meals.\n\"This is an improvement from the standpoint of feeding kids,\" said Christopher Meyer, a research analyst at the Maryland Center on Economic Policy.\nBut shifting resources to the schools that need them leads to ramifications elsewhere.\nIn Baltimore County, for example, average class sizes will go from 25 to 24 in grades 1-3 starting in the fall, but middle school class sizes will grow from 20 to 22 while high school class sizes will increase from 21 to 23.\nAt a February media briefing, Baltimore County Schools Superintendent Myriam Rogers said elementary school class sizes have been reduced under the Blueprint because making sure students can read by third grade \"has been proven time and time again to be an indicator of success.\" In addition, she noted that fifth-graders must pass state tests on reading and math.\nAsked if the larger class sizes in other grades could negatively impact students, Rogers replied: \"No,\" saying district officials were being careful in how they were planning to adjust class sizes.\nBut McCabe, the Carroll County superintendent, reiterated her concern about class-size adjustments called for under the Blueprint.\n\"We are concerned that very large class sizes will be detrimental to student learning,\" McCabe said in an email. \"As we are seeing increased mental health concerns in our student population. It is essential that teachers have a manageable class size in order to meet the varied needs of students.\"\nTHE FUTUREThe Blueprint's long rollout period — along with the nation's post-pandemic bout with inflation — could pose other financial concerns to local school districts.\nMapping out the potential district-level impact of the Blueprint in 2022, the Maryland State Department of Legislative Services projected that 15 of the state's 24 school districts would have to increase local funding levels at some point before the Blueprint rollout is complete in 2034.\n\"The impacts are not uniform … leading several counties to need to make significant increases in their local appropriation to the boards of education in the early years, later years, or both,\" the state report said. \"Other county governments are forecast to spend about the same or slightly more than they would have otherwise.\"\nOf course, inflation could impact those projections. Meyer, the research analyst with the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, noted the Blueprint's cost projections were made before prices skyrocketed at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Actual costs in the economy have gone way up, but the funding amounts that are required under state law haven't,\" Meyer said.\nThat being the case, it's possible that some of the funding requirements in the Blueprint may be changed at some point, either by the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board or the General Assembly.\n\"No law is ever perfect,\" Maryland Education Coalition co-chair Rick Tyler Jr. said. \"We're still early in the process of what is intended to be a 10-year process.\"\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Will Maryland’s Blueprint for education work?\n\n May 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lizzy Alspach and Apurva Mahajan Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1394\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland plans to spend $16.6 billion through 2029, along with billions more after that, to improve its public schools.But will it work?\nState legislators created a seven-member oversight board to ensure it would.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a transformative education law passed in 2021, aims to boost student performance and education quality throughout Maryland schools. It outlines these goals in five pillars: the expansion of prekindergarten, the hiring and retention of high-quality and diverse teachers and leaders, college and career readiness, additional resources, and accountability and governance.\nLawmakers established the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board to monitor the Blueprint's progress. The board oversees funding and initiative implementation while providing guidance to school districts, all with the intention of improving academic performance in Maryland.\n\"I think part of it is just understanding that we can do better, we need to do better and we're going to do better,\" said Rachel Hise, executive director of the accountability board. \"That's the promise of the Blueprint.\"\nSchool leaders across the state tend to agree — but they said the Blueprint comes with complications that go beyond the financial challenges it poses to the state and its 24 public school districts. Educators said they're concerned about the Blueprint's deadlines, a lack of detailed procedural information and the plan's overall place in the educational system.\n\"Implementing a law as comprehensive as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future is going to be a herculean effort under the best of circumstances,\" Baltimore City Public Schools officials wrote in their May 1 report to the accountability board. \"But combined with the added complexities of pandemic recovery, delays that resulted in extremely limited pre-implementation planning time for districts, and the slow pace of regulations and guidance pertaining to the Blueprint, the challenges are amplified.\"\nAssessing the BlueprintThe Accountability and Implementation Board will oversee the progress of each public school system in implementing Blueprint initiatives.\nThe board is by law required to:\nDevelop a plan to fully implement the Blueprint in public school systems, complete with timelines and deadlines.Monitor the progress school districts and the state are making regarding the Blueprint by reporting annually on 92 data measures, which collect information on student performance, teacher preparation and outcomes backed by Blueprint funding.Determine if changes need to be made to the plan to achieve the plan's original goals.Ensure \"Expert Review Teams\" of teachers, faculty and staff observe schools and understand how to make recommendations about changing how the plan is implemented.Release about a quarter of Blueprint funds each year to school systems that are implementing initiatives properly.Hire an independent contractor to evaluate the Blueprint's success.Ensure school systems demonstrate at least 75% of funding received per student follows the students to their school.\nUnder the law, the accountability board can withhold funding from school systems that fail to implement Blueprint initiatives or show significant student progress.\nThe board holds routine meetings to hear from Marylanders. It also has a series of advisory groups to gather feedback from teachers, parents, students and other stakeholders, according to Laura Stapleton, a board member and chair of the University of Maryland's Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methodology.\n\"There's so many moving parts,\" Stapleton said. \"Many different stakeholders are needed to implement all the various parts of the Blueprint.\"\nStretching deadlinesEvery Maryland public school district is responsible for rolling out Blueprint initiatives and collecting each of the 92 different data measures for the Accountability and Implementation Board to evaluate, Stapleton said.\nBut school district officials said none of that is easy.\n\"With educational reform of this scale, it is difficult to keep up with the constant changes, timelines and work of each pillar,\" Carroll County school district leaders said in their May 1 submission to the accountability board.\nJanine Bacquie, Montgomery County Public Schools' Blueprint implementation coordinator, said her district is straining to properly gather data and implement Blueprint initiatives within allocated deadlines.\n\"We're struggling to get the guidance that we need to do the work that we need to do with a short timeline,\" Bacquie said. \"If we had another year or two, it'd certainly take some of the pressure off.\"\nAll 24 school districts were originally required to submit their final Blueprint implementation plans by March 2024.\nBut because the state provided necessary materials — such as report templates and expectations — to districts only two months before the March deadline, the submission schedule was revised.\nThe March deadline was changed so it only had to be a 10-page preliminary report, according to Bacquie. The final report deadline was then pushed back to May 1.\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board is facing a tough deadline, too. According to Stapleton, an independent contractor is set to perform an evaluation of the Blueprint by October.\nBut Stapleton said she hopes the deadline for the evaluation can be pushed back a few years to give the Blueprint's many initiatives more time to lead to change.\nA slow flow of informationMeanwhile, Blueprint information seems to move slowly to and through the state's school districts.\n\"Because the implementation of Blueprint is massive and encompasses the entire district, one of the biggest challenges is communicating with employees the ways in which their work already aligns with the Blueprint,\" Prince George's County school officials said in their March 2024 submission to the accountability board.\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board holds regular meetings on Zoom for anyone to attend. All meetings are held online and published in an online archive for anyone to view.\nBut Javier Valera, a math content specialist at a public middle school in Montgomery County, said he and other teachers have no clue about the depth of information in the Blueprint.\nHe said the state should work harder to keep teachers informed.\nChanges are coming next year, \"and we don't even know anything about it,\" Valera said. \"It is concerning, because we are going to be the ones implementing the plan. … There should be more transparency and they need to talk with us and let us know what is this about.\"\nSparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George's County, echoed Valera's sentiments about a need for more details about the Blueprint.\n\"There's a lot of information that definitely needs to be clarified,\" Jefferson said. \"I think it needs to be disseminated in a clear, concise manner where of course our principals are able to understand — and understand the impact that it has for each school.\"\nMembers of the accountability board encourage community members to provide feedback. Principals, parents and teachers are urged to reach out about the Blueprint, Rachel Amstutz, the accountability board's policy director, said at a principals conference late last year.\n\"We need to hear from the local level what's happening and what you need,\" Amstutz said. \"We need to hear from our parents what's working for their kids and what isn't.\"\nLingering concernsImplementing the Blueprint hasn't gone exactly as planned so far. Deadlines for criteria and implementation plans have been extended at least three times. And in district-level Blueprint plans submitted this spring, school officials across the state expressed a variety of concerns.\n\"From funding uncertainties to staffing shortages and delays in receiving critical guidance, the district must navigate various obstacles to ensure the successful execution of Blueprint initiatives,\" Caroline County school officials said in their March submission to the accountability board.\nMeanwhile, school officials in Allegany County said workforce issues make implementing the Blueprint a challenge. \"Sustaining district-level initiatives across all schools is difficult because of staff retirements and turnover rates,\" officials wrote in their May 1 report.\nIn their Blueprint update, St. Mary's County school officials said they are concerned about all the elements of public education the Blueprint ignores. Other crucial parts of the learning experience could see funding cuts as the district strives to meet the Blueprint's mandates, they said.\n\"The ubiquitous challenge inherent in meeting Blueprint goals is in the fact that the Blueprint is silent on supporting all else, i.e., the arts, athletics, enrichment and after-school programming, transportation, facilities, health care, etc.,\" St. Mary's County school officials wrote. \"These elements of school are necessary and imperative in supporting the whole child.\"\nAmid all the concerns, Bacquie, Montgomery County's Blueprint coordinator, said further delays may be necessary. The rush to complete various measures in the Blueprint could render the plan to reinvent Maryland's public schools less effective than it could otherwise be, she said.\n\"It's not something where you just come in and say something's going to change overnight,\" Bacquie said. \"You're changing hearts, thoughts, minds, strategies.\"\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Foremost, salary increases, with the next priority to address health insurance cost increases (approximately 8%), and an increase in utilities; adjusting for what was also an increase in FY24, and subsequently adjusted for in FY25.\n\"It was a very tight and very concerning push and shove…for coming up with the budget,\" Couch said.\nAdding to the challenge, everything is placed in designated line items now, Couch said, referring to the requirements coming from the Accountability and Implementation Board (another component of the Blueprint) that dictates how funds are allocated and prevents the transfer of funds among categories.\n\"Right now we can't see how it's going to work and its going to be very muddy and its going to be devastating I think unless something changes,\" she said, The AIB consultant is very much aware of this problem and can help us try to figure it out.\nOf the proposed budget, \"This is what I believe what we need to operate our school system,\" Couch said. \"If we don't get the money to make this budget, we will need to figure out what we can do without.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester BOE passes emergency virtual education plan with amendment\n\n May 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 647\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — A drafted prolonged state of emergency virtual education plan, now required by the state through a Maryland Senate bill, brought discussion among the Dorchester County Board of Education at a board meeting Thursday.Dorchester County Public Schools' Jodi Colman, the director of curriculum, instruction and assessment, said the drafted plan includes information about staffing, personnel, student instruction and assessment and learning supports in the event of an emergency that is longer than 14 consecutive days. The plan can be amended as needed when entering into a state of emergency, she said.\n\"The purpose of this is in case something like COVID happened,\" she said about the plan.\nColman said the district needs to submit its plan to the Maryland State Department of Education by June 1.\nAfter Colman talked about why the plan is needed, board member Talibah Chikwendu asked why the draft plan requires that content supervisors are invited into Schoology classrooms, a school management system that connects students and teachers online.\nChikwendu said as a teacher, she puts multiple plans in different places and adjusts those plans based on what she's seeing in the classroom and how students are doing. She said she doesn't like the idea of someone else being able to go into the Schoology classroom and possibly move around or delete things.\n\"Especially if I'm going to be held accountable or made responsible for what is in there,\" she said.\nBoard member Sheri Hubbard asked if this is something content supervisors have access to now. Chikwendu said that they did not currently have that access and that it needs to be given upon request.\n\"Which certainly they could request and certainly a teacher should do,\" Chikwendu said. \"But they don't automatically have it. This plan says that they automatically have to do this, and I don't like that.\"\nColman said her intention for including that line in the plan was to be a support for teachers and not so that supervisors could go into Schoology and make changes.\n\"As you're wearing your teacher hat, if you're not seeing that as a support, that's not what I was going for,\" Colman said to Chikwendu.\nChikwendu said she agreed with offering it as a support but did not like the idea of making it mandatory. The board voted to approve the prolonged emergency virtual education plan on the condition that the content supervisor line is amended to be offered as support rather than mandatory.\nBefore the board passed the plan, the subject of camera usage in virtual classrooms was also brought up. In the plan, it says that cameras need to be turned on in the event that classes become virtual.\nChikwendu said she understood why having cameras on is important, but brought up concerns with bandwidth.\n\"When you have a classroom of even 15 students and all of their cameras are on and your camera is on, the bandwidth is horrible,\" she said, later adding, \"I get why we need to turn them on, I'm just wondering how we manage the bandwidth issues that come with keeping a whole class together for the period of time the Google Meet is on if we have all those kids' cameras on at the same time.\"\nColman said she went back and forth on this aspect of the plan. She said the district learned with the COVID-19 pandemic that not requiring cameras to be on creates a lack of accountability. She said a sentence could be added to the plan to explain that cameras can be turned off in the event of wifi or bandwidth issues.\nChikwendu said she just wanted to make sure everyone was aware of the issue.\nThe board also talked about students not feeling comfortable with classmates and teachers seeing their homes in the background in virtual classroom settings. Hubbard suggested using a standard background for all students on camera so that students' homes aren't in view. Colman said this was something the district could do. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The Sodexo contract was set to expire on June 30 and QACPS is now joining 22 other school systems that run in-house food-service programs in their districts.\nAs of July 2024, QACPS food services will be self-operational and no longer operated by Sodexo as a food service management company. In order to be self operational, a vendor contract is needed to provide the necessary food and items which is currently being procured through the district's food service management company, according to Hickey.\nThe district looks to save money in aspects such as management, by going self operational, she said, and will be joining forces with MSEC to join in a contract with Sysco.\nCaroline County put forth a bid for food and food related items and Sysco was the only bid received, Hickey said.\nThe MSEC contract contains a clause for Queen Anne's to partner and utilize the services. The contract was recently renewed for the third year to begin July 2024 with two more years of renewal options, she said.\nThe total estimated cost for FY25 is $800,000 and will utilize the food service balance account, according to Hickey.\nFood service department staff have been notified of the district's conversion to self-operational and have been given the opportunity to ask questions.\n\"No hourly positions are being cut and they are all encouraged to reapply when the positions become available, \" Hickey said.\nBoard member Richard Smith noted, \"I was back in the day when we had it in-house, then we went out, now we're back in.\"\nWhile the operational budget may not look different within the first year, Hickey emphasized, \"What we're doing is keeping that money in the county, and being able to prioritize and utilize local vendors which it cannot do right now,\" she said. By October, the district hopes to have a partnership with a local vendor in time for Homegrown School Week.\nIn addition to the cost savings, Board President Helen Bennet was particularly excited about the prospect of partnering with local farms, particularly for the benefit of FFA, and looked forward to updates as it moved forward.\nThe board's approval of the contract was necessary as the district needs to begin ordering food for summer programs and the start of next school year, Hickey said.\nIt was also noted, as the district shifts away from its current food service management company Sodexo, so too does its milk distributor service contract and the BOE approved piggybacking off of the MSEC milk contract with Cloverland Dairy.\nCloverland is QACPS's current milk provider through the Sodexo, so the approval just brings a different contract, Hickey said.\nPricing on half pints of regular milk are estimated to be better with the piggybacking contract, Hickey said.\nWicomico County Public Schools put the public bid out for milk delivery and the contract contains a piggyback clause for QACPS to jump on, she said.\nThe total price is expected to be $190,000 for the Fiscal Year 2025 and funding will come from the food service funding account, according to Hickey.\nAn established milk vendor is required as part of compliance with the national school lunch and breakfast programs and federal guidelines, she said.\nThe contract is in effect until June 2026 unless terminated early by Wicomico, which is unlikely, Hickey noted, as Clover Farm is one of the only dairies in the area that has K-12 compliant milk products and has been that way for some time.\nThe board will next meet June 5. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat.

But is throwing money at it going to do it?\"\nTravers said that funding the Blueprint requirements is forcing the county to strip its other services.\n\"They want to buy a Lamborghini on a Toyota budget, and they want to pay for it in a really short time,\" he said.\nSanderson told the council that it's not lost on him that income taxes and property taxes are the main revenue sources for county governments. He said that because two-thirds of Marylanders are at the \"absolute cap\" on the income tax, property taxes are the only way counties are going to be able to pay for their share of the Blueprint.\n\"It's exactly the wrong way to try and fund it,\" Sanderson said. \"Even if you're a big fan of the progressive policies in the Blueprint.\"\nThose policies include expanding full-day pre-K for children in families with incomes up to 300% of the federal poverty line, increasing teacher starting salaries to $60,000 by 2026, implementing a new college and career readiness standard and increasing funding for special education and multilingual learner students.\nIn November, MACo sent a letter to Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson and Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne Jones writing that \"in many ways,\" the Blueprint is a one-size-fits-all approach to investing in education in a state with \"diverse local government capacities, processes and abilities.\"\nThe letter says that record county funding and additional mandated funding for Blueprint will make it difficult for counties to fund other things in their jurisdiction.\nIn the letter, MACo makes a variety of requests — including a more comprehensive cost analysis of the Blueprint, an increase in state aid for the renovation and construction of pre-K facilities and more time for the development of educator career ladder models — to ensure the Blueprint's success.\nAt the meeting, council member Rob Kramer pointed out that 72% of Dorchester County is considered critical area, like wetlands, and cannot be built on. He said that under the new critical areas map, that percentage will increase to 78%. With only so much space that can be built on, how much the county's property tax revenues, which pay for Blueprint requirements, can increase without raising taxes is limited.\n\"We're a small county and we basically rely on property taxes to operate,\" Kramer said. \"So that makes it tough on the ones that do own property here.\"\nCouncil member William Nichols said he refuses to raise taxes on seniors. He said their are a lot of seniors in his district, and they can't afford higher taxes.\nDuring his presentation to the council, Sanderson brought up the Cade Funding Formula for community colleges, which received a reduction from the state for fiscal year 2025, and highway user revenues, which Sanderson said could receive cuts in the future.\nOlszewski said talked about how this affects counties, especially when they have to meet Blueprint requirements.\n\"It sort of becomes, well we can't fund community colleges and roads and all the other things and meet their obligations,\" he said about the Blueprint requirements.\nSanderson said that for any county governing body that doesn't meet Blueprint requirements, its county income taxes will be sent directly to the schools, rather than to the county.\nAt the end of the conversation, Olszewski talked about the importance of facilitating these conversations between MACo and Maryland counties.\n\"They're so helpful because they us sort of inform the legwork (we're) heading into,\" he said. \"And it's already sounding like Blueprint is going to be another major issue that we are going to be taking up in the year ahead.\" \n\n Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "DCPS approves fiscal year 2025 budget in 3 to 1 vote\n\n June 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1386\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Although the Dorchester County Board of Education approved the district's fiscal year 2025 budget on June 3, not everyone felt what was proposed was ready for approval.On social media, county residents shared their concerns, and board member Chris Wheedleton, who could not be at the meeting due to a work conflict, said he was shocked when he found out the budget had been approved.\n\"I as a board member then should have had the opportunity to receive feedback from the community (and) talk with the community about some of the ideas that we should have around that budget so that, by the time we voted, I was equipped to have all that feedback,\" he said.\nOne aspect of the balanced $88.5 million operating budget that drew particular concern — and has since been reversed — was the decision to remove media specialists from libraries, redistributing them to other positions in the school system and putting instructional assistants in the libraries.\nThis would have contributed to the district saving over $313,000, or 32.3%, in salaries and wages expenditures compared to fiscal year 2024, according to board documents.\nBoard member Talibah Chikwendu, who voted against approving the budget, said during the meeting that she thought the board needed to look harder at the budget to find other ways to save that money.\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat Thursday, Chikwendu said she did not like some of the ways that the district's financial concerns were being resolved.\n\"I like the fact that we got a chance to work to resolve them,\" she said, later adding, \"It wasn't about media specialists as much as it was about any frontline staff.\"\nChikwendu said if another category of staff had been moved around like that, \"the objection would have been the same.\"\nAt the meeting, North Dorchester High School librarian Jacqueline Bennett talked about the impact of her role in the school and asked that the district not remove media specialists from libraries.\n\"I understand that you have to make tough decisions, but I've devoted my life to this,\" she said.\nBoard member Sheri Hubbard, who voted in favor of the budget, said she agreed that \"it would be a shame\" to move media specialists to other positions in the district, and clarified that approval of the budget did not mean they couldn't amend it.\nIn an interview Friday, Board President Mike Diaz, who also voted to approve the budget, said Dorchester County Public Schools Interim Superintendent Jymil Thompson made a decision later in the week to not redistribute its media specialists to other positions in the school system.\nOn Wednesday morning, DCPS communications and community outreach specialist Valerie Goff said in an email that the district is \"looking at other means to mitigate the budget shortfalls.\" Goff said Thompson met with district media specialists June 6 to reassure them that their positions are secure.\nLeading up to the district announcing Thompson's decision, multiple took to social media expressing frustrations. Some called on residents to reach out to the Board of Education.\nLucas Thorpe, who ran for Diaz's board seat in the May primaries and lost, took to social media to express his discontent.\nThorpe said in an interview that he doesn't think taking librarians out of the libraries would benefit literacy scores. He said the entire situation points to a larger issue of elected officials trying to run the school system like a business, without considering students and staff.\nThorpe brought up the district's alternative education contract with Vision Quest, which the district is paying more than $93,000 per month for, as well as two alternative education programs with Transforming Lives for elementary and middle schools that the board approved at the June 3 meeting. He said that although alternative education is important, the public needs to draw concern to these contracts.\nDiaz said in an interview that alternative education is something DCPS has used for many years. He said the Board felt Vision Quest was \"best poised\" to provide services to the district, and mentioned there are services built into the program like family functional therapy.\nUNANSWERED QUESTIONS\nAlthough Wheedleton was aware the budget had been included on the agenda for the meeting, he said he communicated with the Finance Committee — made up of Diaz, board Vice President Susan Morgan, Thompson and DCPS Assistant Comptroller Laurie Dale — ahead of the meeting to say he didn't think the board was ready to approve the budget.\nWheedleton told them he still needed answers to some \"significant questions\" related to the budget approval process so that he could support the budget moving forward.\n\"I asked, both verbally and in writing, when we would be having a community meeting to share both the challenges and the priorities that we were working through, when we would have a meeting where we were expected to vote and what needed to be submitted to either the state or the county,\" Wheedleton said in an interview with the Star Democrat on Friday. \"And I still have yet to receive answers to those questions.\"\nIn the interview, Wheedleton spoke about the importance of receiving community feedback in the budget process. He said that, instead, the board made a decision at a meeting they knew he wouldn't be able to attend and gave no time for community feedback on Thompson's budget presentation.\nWheedleton said that although he is expressing his concerns publicly, he remains committed to working with the board to find \"productive solutions.\"\n\"I really do want us to learn from this and move forward in a way that we can all work together to make the best possible decisions for the schools and our students,\" he said.\nAt the meeting, Diaz said unlike previous years where it would take about two months of work to get the budget to the finish line, the fiscal year 2025 budget process started in January.\n\"I can't tell you how many meetings we did and the hours that we committed to really getting into this thing to make it what it is right now,\" Diaz said at the meeting. \"Nobody's ever going to be perfect, and I think there's probably still some more work to do ongoing as we move through this thing.\"\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat Friday, Diaz said there are some things the board will agree on and others that it won't. He said it's inevitable that there are times when board members can't attend a meeting.\n'FISCAL CLIFF'\nThe balanced $88.5 million operating budget is a $7.4 million increase from fiscal year 2024.\nState revenue sources total $59.9 million, an increase of $4.6 million from fiscal year 2024. County revenue sources total $23.7 million, a decrease of $265,200 from fiscal year 2024. The remaining revenue comes from fund balance carryover from prior years and other funding sources, like investment income and building use income.\nCompared to the fiscal year 2024 budget, fixed charges expenditures increased 22%, from $17.8 million. Pupil services had the second largest increase between fiscal year 2024 and 2025 budgets, increasing 7.8%, from $2.7 million to $6.8 million.\nIn his budget presentation at the June 3 meeting, Thompson talked about the \"fiscal cliff\" that is coming with COVID-19-related Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funding and Maryland Leads grant funding coming to an end.\nDiaz said the district is trying to dial it back when it comes to spending. In January, the board asked for an audit trail so it could look at every financial transaction the district makes.\n\"We had an overspending problem,\" Diaz said. \"And to get the house back in order, we've got to do certain things to right that ship. And it's painful sometimes. And they're hard decisions to make.\"\nBoard members also talked about costs that are out of the district's control. Diaz mentioned inflation and Morgan, who voted to approve the budget, said there was a requirement of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future that the district will need to increase teacher starting salaries to $60,000 by 2026.\n\"That's not an easy thing to do,\" she said. \"And that's causing a lot of money to be poured into personnel.\"\nThompson warned that it's possible more cuts will need to be made down the road.\n\"We really have to look at our financial situation,\" he said, later adding, \"Our financial situation hasn't improved, and we've made a lot of poor decisions that have gotten us into this situation that we're in currently.\"\nThis story has been updated to include the district's response. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot school board passes special education staffing plan\n\n June 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 697\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot County Board of Education unanimously approved a special education staffing plan at its meeting Wednesday, but not without pinpointing areas to improve moving forward.Kristin Mentges, director of special education, showed projections that indicate the number of elementary special education students will decrease at all five schools this fall, though that may change as younger students' needs are identified early next school year.\nWhile Easton High School had a projected decrease in special education students, Easton Middle projects to increase from 71 to 85 and St. Michaels Middle High is expected to go from 38 to 51 students.\nMentges recommended that elementary and secondary staffing remain the same heading into next year, as well as the seven current speech therapists.\n\"We do feel like the number of teachers can currently support this number of students,\" Mentges said of the recommendation for secondary staffing. \"The caseloads are going to be a little bit higher, but not a whole lot.\"\nBoard members questioned if it would be more effective to analyze staffing needs for the elementary schools based on hours of need rather than number of students.\n\"116 students can be kind of elusive because it really is dependent upon the number of hours those students have,\" board Vice President Candace Henry said, referencing the upcoming projection for Easton Elementary. \"In configuring how many teachers are proposed, is it based on how many students that you have or how many hours the students are needing?\"\n\"It's both,\" Mentges replied. \"So we look at the hours, we look at the environments that the students are served in, as well as the numbers of students total.\"\nHenry asked that the presentation include those hours in the future, as did board President Emily Jackson.\n\"We have asked for hours every year, and we have not yet been able to discuss hours per student,\" Jackson said. \"We talk a lot, especially from a budget perspective, about our growing needs in special education. And to me it seems like our special ed staff has been pretty flat.\n\"It doesn't seem like we are really as a county growing with the student need proportionally.\"\nAdditional recommendations presented by Mentges included the addition of a special education supervisor and four additional instructional assistants \"to support young students with more significant disabilities.\"\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the next step would be setting up a work session next month to lay out special education data and indicate areas to improve upon. Henry requested that in the future, a work session be scheduled prior to the approval of the staffing plan, to which the board and Pepukayi agreed.\n\"I would like to continue this conversation,\" Jackson said. \"A yes vote from me tonight does not mean a 'check this box, let's talk about it next year.' If we could continue this conversation at a more frequent pace, that would be fantastic.\"\nENROLLMENT STEADY\nKevin Shafer, Talbot County Public Schools' director of operations, presented enrollment projects reviewed by the Maryland Department of Planning. Numbers are steady and no schools were marked to be overutilized.\n\"TCPS remains in a relatively comfortable position related to our overall utilization across all facilities,\" Shafer said. He signaled housing development, demographic shifts and the state's education plan — Blueprint for Maryland's Future — as potential as areas of uncertainty in regards to enrollment and facility needs.\nEaston High peaked around 93% facility utilization last year, according to how large of an enrollment it could support, but Shafer said that percent will drop in years to come. All other percents came in under 90%, with Tilghman Elementary at a district-low 57% last year.\nShafer was asked by the board which school may be next in line for renovations after Chapel District Elementary School's upcoming expansion. He said Easton High School would be next, even if it's not needed the most.\n\"We would look at the state facility assessment data and use the data in order to make an informed decision on what makes more sense,\" Shafer said. \"The truth of the matter is that Easton Middle School is probably in a greater need for a renovation, but unfortunately state funding is dependent on the age of the building. … We have some years yet before we would qualify for funding.\" \n\n ",

    "content": "Dorchester school board Vice President Susan Morgan resigns\n\n June 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 860\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Susan Morgan, Dorchester County Board of Education vice president and former president, has resigned. Morgan made the announcement on Friday following a contentious vote and discussion during Thursday's school board meeting.Morgan said she also is withdrawing from running for reelection on the November ballot.\nAt the Thursday, June 13, meeting fractures in board member relationships were apparent.\nMorgan was the sole vote in favor of keeping the contract with Vision Quest, an alternative education program for district high schoolers that has been met with criticism from residents since it was approved in September.\nOver three years, this would have cost the district more than $3.3 million — one of the primary reasons other members voted against the contract. Morgan advocated for the program, citing seven students who graduated this year who otherwise would not have.\nThis vote was not the only reason Morgan decided to resign, she said in an interview with the Dorchester Star. \"My decision,\" she said, \"[came] when I saw the direction the people appointed by the County Council — not elected by the people — have chosen to take.\"\nMorgan referred to appointed members, Chris Wheedleton and Tabilah Chikwendu, who filled vacancies on the board this year.\nAt the June 13 meeting, board member Wheedleton called out the board for not being more collaborative.\nThe accusation came 10 days after the Board of Education voted to approve the proposed fiscal year 2025 budget at a meeting where Wheedleton was absent. At that meeting, the board acknowledged the challenges of passing a balanced budget and interim Superintendent Jymil Thompson talked about the \"fiscal cliff\" that is coming with COVID-19-related funding nearing an end.\nWheedleton, who was not at the June 3 meeting due to a work conflict, said he was shocked when he found out the budget had been approved. Wheedleton brought this up at the meeting Thursday, calling out board leadership, revealing fractures within the board.\n\"I'm now convinced, after a year on the board, that one of the biggest challenges in DCPS, if not the biggest, is this board,\" he said. \"I am part of that, so I am partly to blame. I have failed in bringing people together, and I need to be part of whatever solutions we find.\"\nWheedleton said he hates to have to make statements like this.\n\"This does not feel collaborative, and it feels divisive,\" he said. \"But this experience and the culture of this board currently matches that.\"\nThompson, whose four-year superintendent contract beginning July 1 was unanimously approved at the start of the meeting, asked that everyone work together.\n\"Because if this is the reality, if we don't get better, if we don't work together, we're going to still be sitting at 23 in five years,\" he said. \"That's a guarantee.\"\nSince becoming interim superintendent in March, Thompson has talked about the need to increase the district's ranking from 23rd in the state. At the meeting, he said the district will be using the hashtag #23nomore this year. There are 24 school districts in Maryland, one in each of the 23 counties plus Baltimore City.\nThompson talked about the importance of seeing one's role in the district as bigger than themself.\n\"I'll say it 1,000 times,\" he said. \"I'm the superintendent, but the job's not about me. It's much bigger. And that's what I want to keep the focus on, the most important people. And that's our kids.\"\nIn an interview Saturday afternoon with the Dorchester Star, Morgan said that crafting the fiscal year 2025 budget — the budget approved in Wheedleton's absence — was difficult for the board. Losing COVID-era funding and having to decide whether to continue to fund hires made during the COVID-19 pandemic was a tough decision.\nIn addition to funding Vision Quest — a need Morgan saw as a paramount to creating a good alternative school program — the safety of teachers, their pay and the performance of students have always been forefront in her decision-making, she said.\nGoing through expense reports for the past three fiscal years, Morgan said she was \"simply amazed at what was spent.\" In that deep dive, Morgan said they discovered \"rampant misspending with no real controls or oversight.\"\nWhile the board enacted a freeze on spending and hiring was only approved for those positions that opened due to attrition, Morgan said she thinks this year's budget \"might be saved, but it won't be known for a while yet.\"\nThe contract for Vision Quest was fair, Morgan said, reiterating the need for an alternative program for the fall — one that will benefit the students as much as Morgan witnessed first-hand with the success of Vision Quest.\nMorgan said when the \"surprise\" vote on Vision Quest was made, and she saw her fellow members voting to eliminate the program \"without anything other than hearsay\" she knew her opportunity to influence the board for the betterment of Dorchester County students was not to be.\nMorgan's term was set to expire in December. She had filed earlier to run against Christine LaMonica in the general election to retain her District 3 seat on the board. Saturday, she said she is no longer running for reelection.\nSchool board President Mike Diaz said he would have a statement about the situation on Wednesday. \n\n Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Along with Wheedleton, board members Talibah Chikwendu and Sheri Hubbard voted in favor of terminating the contract. Board Vice President Susan Morgan voted against termination, and board President Mike Diaz abstained from the vote and stayed silent during the discussion, as his wife is employed at Vision Quest.\nAccording to the contract, either party can terminate the agreement by providing written notice at least 180 days before the termination date. Under the agreement, Dorchester County Public Schools paid Vision Quest $93,363 per month for:\nIn-school services — such as psycho-educational groups, anger management and conflict resolution — for up to 10 students at any given time.Voluntary off-campus educational and behavioral support services at Vision Quest's Morningstar Youth Academy facility in Woolford for up to 16 students at any given time.Family functional therapy services for up to 10 DCPS families at any given time.\nOver three years, this would have cost the district over $3.3 million.\nBefore the vote, Wheedleton said he had multiple conversations with constituents about Vision Quest. He said the contract should be terminated because it is \"fiscally irresponsible\" and he believes Vision Quest has violated its contract with DCPS by not providing monthly reports.\n\"I, as a board member, have only seen two reports this year on progress,\" he said, adding that he doesn't think those reports have actually demonstrated progress.\nWheedleton said he believes there needs to be alternative education options for students, but this current agreement is not in the district's best interest.\nMorgan — who said she had been to Morningstar Youth Academy in Woolford and talked with parents of the students in the program — asked Wheedleton if he had visited the facility. He said he had not because that is not his job as a board member.\nMorgan said there were seven district students who graduated this year that wouldn't have if they had \"stayed on the path they were on.\"\n\"You have no idea what would have happened to those students if they had been in our schools supported by another program,\" Wheedleton said in response.\nMorgan said DCPS has tried other alternative education programs that have been unsuccessful. She said the school system won't have enough time to put another program in place before school starts in the fall.\nWheedleton said he believes the district's executive team has time to form a new agreement for an alternative education program.\n\"It's a three-year contract,\" Morgan said. \"And if you want to break the contract and you think you have the reasons, then you've made the vote.\"\nChikwendu said she didn't believe the Vision Quest contract is in the best interest of DCPS students. She said she has based that on information from people who have gone to the facility, from people who have seen the program inside schools and from the Vision Quest reports that the schools have received.\nHubbard said she voted to terminate the contract due to the \"numerous, numerous complaints\" she has received about Vision Quest as well as a conversation she had with a former Vision Quest staff member about the conditions. \n\n © Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Simmons pointed to a $185,000 increase in miscellaneous revenue, interest revenue and non-resident tuition.\n\"We had a good year with interest revenue,\" he said.\nRevenue from the county totals $18.49 million, an increase of $2.4 million over the previous year, and revenue from the state totals $75 million, an increase of $1.38 million over the previous year.\nSimmons talked about rising expenditures, such as budget adjustments for Blueprint for Maryland's Future programs, a 5% increase in health insurance costs and increases due to the cost of doing business. Those cost of business increases include Maryland Association of Boards of Education insurance costs and transportation costs.\nWhen it comes to Blueprint programming, unrestricted career ladders and unrestricted transitional supplemental instruction — which had both previously been restricted — will cost the district $559,688.\nSimmons said teacher pension costs continue to increase a little every year.\nSimmons also talked about the need to fund positions that were previously funded through COVID-19-related Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funding and Maryland Leads grants, which will both expire in September. Those positions include a third assistant principal at North Caroline High School and three technology support positions so the district can continue to have those employees in each building.\n\"We've learned that having tech support in person available at every campus was a much better model than having a centralized model and literally sending people out to the buildings,\" Simmons said. \"The mileage was killing us.\"\nSimmons said the district was able to save money from salary lapse, which is when new employees that are hired to fill the positions of people retiring. Because the new hires often have less experience than their predecessors, their salaries aren't as high.\n\"So you get some savings there,\" Simmons said.\nAfter Simmons' presentation, commissioners asked questions related to the Blueprint, a state plan to improve student outcomes and the quality of education through increasing education funding by $3.8 billion over a 10 year period.\nCommission Vice President Larry Porter asked Simmons how close the district is to reaching a $60,000 starting salary for teachers, which districts must do by 2026, per the Blueprint.\nSimmons said starting teacher salaries for next year are over $55,000, and he believes the district will reach the $60,000 mandate by 2026.\nThere are two scales for teachers: the traditional scale and the career ladder. The career ladder is a part of one of the five pillars of the Blueprint.\nTeachers on the career ladder are encouraged to pursue National Board Certification, which is a process that teaches teachers to reflect on their craft. An expenditure of $70,000 in the fiscal year 2025 operating budget will go toward increasing salaries for teachers who receive that certification.\nSimmons said the district will reach the $60,000 salary minimum by 2026 for teachers who are on the career ladder, but not for teachers on the traditional scale. He said current teachers have the option to stay on the traditional scale or move onto the career ladder.\n\"But all new hired staff will start on the career ladder,\" he said. \"So that will be the scale that we get to ($60,000).\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This includes prepayments and covering for anticipated overages.\nJones asked for approval to transfer $75,000 to student services, in part for prepayments on software, and $500,000 to transportation to prepay upcoming bus lease payments.\nThe district also asked to transfer $600,000 to fixed charges for other postemployment benefits contributions and health insurance prepayments.\n\"We're just trying to make headway there because we're very far behind on that liability,\" Jones said of the benefits payments.\nTo balance the budget, Jones requested that savings from three categories — instructional salaries, special education and interfund transfer to capital projects — be used to transfer the funds. Notably, there was $850,000 saved in instructional salaries.\n\"Whenever we're transferring out of instructional salaries, it always raises an eyebrow,\" Council Vice President Pete Lesher said. \"Because of course that savings comes from vacant positions.\"\n\" … I'm curious what the plan is to fill those positions for the coming years so that we don't see that loss in direct student contact,\" Lesher said.\nJones said the district has a director of recruitment and retention. She also mentioned that having mentors for teachers has been \"very helpful for retention of newly-hired staff.\"\n\"I think a little bit of the savings are a reflection of us having grant availability this year,\" Jones added. \" … If money frees up in a grant and it's appropriate to charge a teacher or part of a teacher salary, we're going to use that money.\"\n\"It's comforting to know that you're being intentional about ensuring that those positions will get filled,\" Lesher said. \" … The success of the schools is one of our most powerful economic development tools. When the schools succeed, it helps all the other businesses, everybody else who's looking to hire in this community.\"\nThe council approved the request unanimously. \n\n Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Diaz resigns from Dorchester Board of Education\n\n July 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 648\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Mike Diaz, president of the Board of Education of Dorchester County, has resigned his position, leaving three members on the five-member board.According to a Monday morning press release from Dorchester County Public Schools, Diaz cited health and family concerns as the reason behind his resignation, which was effective June 28.\nIn an interview Monday, Diaz said this was something he's been thinking about since undergoing a liver transplant in February.\n\"During that time I was recovering and thinking about leaving the board,\" he said. \"But I also wanted to see through the new superintendent process and knew that would take a few months.\"\nDiaz said he almost died after getting an infection in May.\n\"Fortunately my wife found me passed out on the floor,\" he said. \"The Dorchester County paramedics did a fantastic job, and I received great medical care. And I'm still here.\"\nDiaz said he wanted to make sure he left the board and the management of the board \"in good hands and on good footing\" before resigning, and he felt that had been accomplished when he resigned Friday.\nDiaz' resignation comes on the heels of Board Vice President Susan Morgan's resignation in mid-June.\nMorgan announced her resignation one day after a board meeting that broadcast fractures in board member relationships. At the meeting, Board Member Chris Wheedleton called out board leadership and said the culture of the board felt \"divisive\" rather than collaborative.\nDiaz said his health was the only reason for his resignation.\n\"Every board or council or what have you has its moments,\" he said. \"People trying to work together and find a common path. And (my resignation) has nothing to do with anything other than when I fell ill in February.\"\nWith neither a president nor vice president, the board is planning to have a special meeting next week where an election for a president and vice president will be held, said DCPS communications and community outreach specialist Valerie Goff.\nAlthough the board is currently down two members, the remaining three members make up the minimum number of members needed to hold a meeting, or a quorum.\nThe Dorchester County Council is in charge of making appointments to vacant Board of Education seats. Monday morning, Goff said the county had been made aware of Diaz's resignation. She said the district is waiting to hear how soon the county is planning to move and what it is planning to do.\nGoff said she does not know how far along the council is in appointing Morgan's seat.\n\"The important thing for Dorchester County Public Schools is focusing on the upcoming school year,\" Goff said. \"These resignations will be dealt with by the County Council, and we'll await and hear from them. But we're busy here getting ready to push out the next school year.\"\nNOVEMBER ELECTION\nBefore submitting their resignations, both Diaz and Morgan were running for reelection in District 1 and District 3, respectively.\nDorchester County Board of Elections Program Manager Kim Jones said Morgan has already withdrawn from the election and her name will not appear on the ballot for the general election in November.\nDiaz, who received the second highest number of votes in his district in the May primary, has not decided if he will withdraw from the election. He said he doesn't know what the future holds and it is something he will have to discuss with his family.\nIf Diaz chooses to withdraw from the election, his name will also be removed from the ballot as long as he withdraws before the ballots are proofed in August, Jones said.\nDiaz said he wishes nothing but the best to the board and recently appointed Superintendent Jymil Thompson.\n\"As with anything, I hope that (the board) stays aligned with the common goals that we have set forth,\" he said. \"And that's retaining teachers and providing good alternative education programs and school safety. ... Those are things that are going to make good school systems.\"\nThis report may be updated. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Finding childcare in Maryland is hard. Finding good childcare is even harder\n\n July 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KHUSHBOO RATHORE Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 2331\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When Stephanie Jovine searched for child care for her nearly 4-year-old daughter LuzMarie in Prince George's County in 2015, she found two options, both of them bad.Jovine couldn't afford the first one, and the second denied the young girl snacks and then sheets for sleeping.\n\"I was so upset, you know, it was so hard to trust anyone,\" said Jovine, a teacher in the District of Columbia Public Schools at the time.\nAfter six months of searching, Jovine found a grandmother who ran a small before-and-after care service, LiLi's Child Care Center, in Temple Hills. The times the program was open aligned perfectly with Jovine's needs.\n\"She's a godsend, for real,\" said Jovine, who's now 33.\nJovine's arduous search for child care is not unique — and it would not even be her last search. Interviews with several Maryland families showed that while finding child care is hard, finding a facility that fits a family's needs and budget is even harder.\nMaryland offers a rating system to help parents select the right child care facility, but providers say the rating system is difficult to navigate. Most parents interviewed by the Local News Network said they never looked at the state rating system.\nSimilarly, the state offers a generous scholarship program to help pay for child care, but providers complain they often have to wait months for the state to pay for child care for those scholarship recipients. Parents like Jovine struggle with the scholarship program, too.\nThe complications of finding child care in Maryland often leave families waiting for a place for their child, and that can lead to trouble, said Doug Lent, communications director for Maryland Family Network, which helps parents find child care and helps providers manage their businesses.\n\"When you're on that waiting list, that's when you're more likely to be tempted to rely on unlicensed care, unregulated care, and get into a situation that's maybe not safe or maybe not high quality,\" Lent said.\nThe ratings dilemma\nLinda Garey woke up at 6 a.m. on a springtime Saturday at her home in Dundalk to create a communication board for the autistic children she cares for daily in her home. Eleven hours later, she was still working on the project. She isn't paid for the time she spends preparing her classroom.\nGarey is a level-3 provider with Maryland EXCELS, the child care quality rating system in the state that offers a top rating of 5. Garey created a 65-page handbook outlining her teaching philosophy. She also assists other programs with their handbooks.\n\"I've typed probably about 20 to 30 handbooks and turned them in for other people, right? And they're all level 5,\" she said.\nEXCELS is an optional program for licensed child care providers. It offers them training and guidance and, if they qualify for it, a rating that parents can refer to when choosing a place to care for their child.\nThe Maryland EXCELS rating is based on five categories: licensing, staff qualifications, accreditation, developmentally appropriate practices and administrative policies. The highest overall rating a facility can get is the lowest rating it gets in any of those five categories.\nAnd even though Garey has more than 20 years of experience, her lack of national accreditation as a child care provider means she can't go higher than level 3.\nGarey is working on getting her child development associate credential and becoming accredited — but she won't be submitting that information to Maryland EXCELS. She said whenever she submits new documents and information to the Maryland State Department of Education, it goes to waste.\n\"'I turned in some information about 20 times and it was denied,\" she said.\nState officials insist they are trying to help. Jena Smith, the director of quality improvement initiatives at the state's Division of Early Childhood, said quality assurance specialists work with each child care facility to improve its quality rating.\nThe Maryland State Department of Education also publishes a provider toolkit that outlines the documents necessary to rise up the ratings ladder, Smith said. The requirements for each level build on the last, she said.\n\"It's a scaffold, and so that's really how our quality assurance specialists work with our programs,\" Smith said. \"They help them assess where they currently are and where they want to go.\"\nSince January 2020, the number of level-5 providers in Maryland has increased by 9.6%, according to state statistics retrieved by the Local News Network. However, 15 of the state's 24 jurisdictions have lost level-5 providers, and providers overall appear to have mixed feelings about the EXCELS program.\nAsked to rate the EXCELS program's effectiveness on a 1-to-5 scale, with 1 being least effective and 5 being most effective, the 256 child care providers who replied to a Local News Network survey gave the program an average rating of 3.\n\"I answered 3 because part of the program, I feel, has been extremely helpful, such as writing policies for guidance (on) nutrition and such,\" Cheryl Thomsen, a child care provider in Salisbury, wrote in her survey response. \"I did obtain accreditation but found it was very difficult to actually follow all the requirements properly on a daily basis.\"\nA difficult search\nJovine moved from Prince George's County to Waldorf, in Charles County, in 2020 and left teaching. Two years later, she returned to the District of Columbia Public Schools system while pregnant with her second child — only to discover searching for child care was still difficult and time-consuming.\n\"I was looking and looking and looking for child care,\" she said.\nJovine experienced exactly what other young mothers have experienced in recent years. She went on a frantic search for child care without referring to the state's EXCELS ratings.\nPriya Mahfooz's son Zakir was born in May 2019. She sent Zakir to a child care facility near the family home in Clarksburg, in Montgomery County, a few months later. But that operation shut down at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, never to reopen.\nDesperate for child care, Mahfooz and a friend banded together to hire the teacher who ran that closed facility to look after their children. Each family paid the teacher $425 a week.\nIn the summer of 2021, Mahfooz decided to send Zakir back to a child care facility. During her search, Mahfooz said, she didn't rely on Maryland EXCELS or the state inspection reports.\n\"When you're searching, it's really just whatever you're being fed in your feeds,\" Mahfooz said. \"You're thinking about price, location, (online) ratings.\"\nMahfooz found a child care slot for Zakir later that summer in Germantown and then enrolled him in Green Valley Montessori School in September 2021.\nMeanwhile, Javiera King, an administrator at the University of Maryland, had to hire a nanny to take care of her young daughter, Layla, while the family searched for a slot in a child care facility.\nWhile pregnant, \"I had to put myself on a waitlist already because most day cares have a waitlist a year out,\" she said.\nKing's nanny gave her two weeks notice in December 2023. That meant King had to quickly piece together a schedule where family members took turns caring for her daughter, who was 11 months old at the time. The family then found a child care facility that had a part-time slot for Layla, meaning the family's piecemeal plan for caring for the young girl would continue.\nFinally, in February, Layla's part-time slot at that facility became full-time.\n\"We were really lucky with how everything played out for us,\" King said.\nJovine wasn't so lucky. When she was five months pregnant with her second child, she called 12 child care facilities. All of them had a waiting list of a year or more for infants.\nHer daughter Lily was born at the end of February 2023, and Jovine finished the school year on maternity leave. She had to go back to work in August, but the earliest availability at most nearby child care facilities was in October.\n\"There was one spot that had an availability. I wasn't too satisfied with it,\" Jovine said.\nThere were few toys and learning tools. The outdoor play equipment was dirty and the facility had no curriculum for promoting development in infants, Jovine said.\nShe found another option on a billboard. Jovine called that facility and when she found they had a spot, she took it. She only took three days off work to care for Lily.\nThe facility Jovine sent Lily to after a 10-month search is enrolled in the EXCELS program but is not yet rated.\nAsked if she referred to the EXCELS system during her search, Jovine said she didn't even know about the state rating system at the time.\nJovine has seen her daughter develop significantly at the day care. Lily is happy to go and a little reluctant to leave in the evenings, Jovine said.\n\"This is how I know she's in good hands. She likes it there,\" she said.\nA scholarship program\nIn addition to offering ratings of the state's child care providers, Maryland expanded its child care scholarship program in 2022, making it easier to afford child care, said Heather Harding, coordinator at the Federalsburg Judy Center in Caroline County.\nBut providers said the scholarship program doesn't work as well in practice as it does in theory.\nThe eligibility requirements for the scholarship program allow middle class families to apply. Any family of two making less than $61,222 per year is eligible; for a family of four, the limit is $104,438.\nA new fast-track program, launched on July 1, 2023, aims to reduce the wait time for parents to receive approval for a scholarship. Three days after applying, eligible families can get 60 days of child care paid for while their long-term aid application is processed. Scholarship values each year can range from $9,000 to $25,000 per child.\nLent, of the Maryland Family Network, said the new fast-track has vastly improved the scholarship program. Previously, parents would be placed on a waiting list to receive help with their child care expenses, he said.\nBut other requirements can make the system a catch-22, Harding said. Parents are required to be enrolled in school or working to be eligible for the scholarship, she said. But many of them can't do either unless they have child care guaranteed.\n\"Even if they find it, then they can't pay for it till they get the scholarship,\" Harding said.\nThese scholarships can only be used in facilities that are enrolled in the EXCELS program. After parents receive a voucher from the state, they present it to the provider. The provider then has to send paperwork to the state in order to be paid.\nGarey, the child care provider from Dundalk, said this is one of the most frustrating parts about the process. Multiple times, she filed paperwork and had to wait three months to be paid. At one point, the state owed her $15,000 in scholarship pay. This happened after the state moved to an advance-payment system that was supposed to provide providers with income more quickly.\n\"It's this delay after delay after delay,\" Garey said.\nShe finds ways to deal with the months-late payments because she refuses to make the parents pay or to drop families from her list of clients.\n\"One little girl is nonverbal. She sang and pointed to every single letter of the alphabet,\" Garey said. \"I did that. So why in the world would I drop that family?\"\nOther providers also complain about late scholarship payments. Christine Morris, the director of Trinity Lutheran Christian School and Early Learning Center in Joppa, in Harford County, said this spring that the state owed her $40,000 in scholarship payments. And Shantel Rouzer, who runs Happy Feet Enrichment Childcare Center in Baltimore City, said she turned away students on the scholarship program because she knows the state's reimbursements will come so late.\n\"It's not the families' fault, but (Maryland State Department of Education officials) don't hear us!!!?? And providers are tired!!!\" Rouzer wrote in response to a survey from the Local News Network.\nSolving her own problem\nParents like Jovine don't always know about the scholarship program. When she found out about the program in February, months after Lily, her youngest daughter, started day care, Jovine applied. A day later, the program's new fast-track program started temporarily covering her child care costs for two months.\n\"It took a huge load, And it's amazing to have that option,\" she said.\nBefore that, Jovine was paying $1,360 per month for child care for Lily. On top of that, she had to provide snacks, milk, lunch and other resources to the center.\nBut four days before Jovine's temporary aid expired, she hadn't gotten a final decision from the state. Jovine didn't receive a response until June. By then, she was already paying out of pocket.\nShe'll have to continue to do so because the state decided she was earning too much money to qualify. Noting her application listed extra money from her old job at D.C. Public Schools that doesn't reflect what she's making now, she has reapplied.\nJovine and her longtime partner, Abdul Dopson, now need child care more than ever. Their third child, Mia, was born on June 14.\nKnowing infant spots are difficult to find, Jovine decided to leave her teaching job — and do her own small part to alleviate Maryland's child care shortage.\n\"I got licensed to start a day care myself: a home day care,\" she said. \"The need is that prevalent, you know, I might as well try to open up a day care myself and see what happens.\"\nJovine's fledgling child care facility, Elite Kidz Clubhouse, opens in August — but it's already overtaken her home's living room and dining room. She's spent more than $2,500 on cots, desks, developmentally appropriate toys and other necessities.\nA large, colorful tree painted on the wall of the facility showcases the skills Jovine wants her students to get out of their day-to-day activities. Jovine said she wants her facility to work its way through the EXCELS system and eventually qualify as a preschool under the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education reform plan.\n\"Why not start this beautiful generation how it should, educating them and giving them what they need to be successful little children?\" she said.\nLocal News Network reporter Laura Shaughnessy contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Milk cartons are now 55 cents each.\nMeal prices do not impact the number of students who would be eligible for free or reduced meals, Hickey said.\nIn other business it was noted, as it moves toward self operational food services, QACPS once again approved a piggybacking contract, this one a little more soft served.\nThe BOE approved a piggyback off Anne Arundel County Public Schools contract with Hershey Creamery Company for ice cream products and freezers.\nThis contract that other Maryland school districts are piggybacking off of is set to expire March 2025 and then QACPS will be able to piggyback off of Baltimore County Public Schools' bid through March 2028, Hickey said.\nThe fiscal impact will be $50,000 and funding will be out of the food service fund balance account, she said.\nQACPS currently sells Hershey's ice cream as an a la carte item.\nThe QACPS Board of Education will next meet July 17 at 6 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

On July 18, Brandy Dawson Cumberland and Christine LaMonica — who were appointed by the Dorchester County Council to fill Diaz and Morgan's seats — will be sworn in as the District 1 and District 3 board members, respectively.\nAt the meeting on Thursday, Hubbard said the board welcomes Cumberland and LaMonica and looks forward to working together \"to help make Dorchester County Public Schools a place where students are safe and get the best education possible, a place where teachers look forward to coming to work and want to serve their entire careers here, and a place where parents are happy to send their children to us, knowing we will do our all for them.\"\nALTERNATIVE EDUCATION\nAfter electing its new leadership, the board unanimously approved a one-year contract with Transforming Lives for an alternative education program for elementary and middle school students.\nThe program — which will be housed at The Judy Center at Sandy Hill Elementary School and at the New Directions Learning Academy — will cost the district $950,000, or about $79,000 each month for 12 months. The program will serve a maximum of 48 students at one time.\nAt the meeting, DCPS Superintendent Jymil Thompson said the district looks at this program as one stop in a student's education journey. He said it is a place where students can remedy behavior and improve academics before going back into a \"regular educational setting.\"\nThompson also said the district is looking for a new term to replace \"alternative education.\"\n\"We're going to change the term to something more positive in nature,\" he said.\nAlternative education has been a hot topic in Dorchester County this past school year.\nIn June, the Board of Education voted to terminate its more than three-year contract with Vision Quest, an alternative education program for district high schoolers that has been met with criticism from residents since the contract was approved in September. The district had been paying Vision Quest $93,363 per month for services, which would have added up to over $3.3 million over three years.\nOne day after the vote — and a tense discussion leading up to the vote — Morgan resigned from the board. Morgan was the only board member to vote against terminating the Vision Quest contract.\nAt the meeting on Thursday, Hubbard said the Vision Quest program will be available to district high school students for the first half of the 2024-2025 school year.\n\"And then we will make a determination somewhere in that timeframe (of) how to proceed,\" she said.\nOne thing Hubbard likes about the Transforming Lives program for elementary and middle schools is that the professionals from Transforming Lives will train teachers, she said.\n\"So that eventually we will be able to do this on our own without having to look to a third party,\" she said. \"So I think that's a very positive step forward.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘Stretched very thin’: Child care providers in Talbot County seeing long waitlists\n\n July 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1214\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CORDOVA — When Melissa Johnson flips through her binder, she's reminded of around 80 families anxiously awaiting day care services. Some of the children on the waitlist are under a year old. Others are not born.Johnson, the director of Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers' Cordova site, calls it a \"heart-wrenching situation.\"\nCritchlow Adkins is a nonprofit that provides preschool and before- and after-school care across five sites in Talbot County. Over 100 children are on the waitlist for Critchlow's child care services in Cordova.\n\"And I really feel so bad because I want to help them, but I just cannot,\" Johnson said. \"There's a staff-child ratio.\"\nRelief for some families on waitlists in Cordova is expected by next year.\nRenovation plans for Chapel District Elementary School will allow Critchlow Adkins to build a new preschool room for 3-year-olds, two additional classrooms, an office and a teacher workspace.\nNotably, Executive Director Christy Morrell said they will double the amount of before- and after-school children they can serve from 30 to 60. Currently, that program, which includes students in kindergarten through fifth grade, operates in the school cafeteria.\n\"When school's in session, we share the cafeteria,\" Johnson said. \"And there have been a lot of times that we have been displaced. We have to relocate because of an activity or something that goes on in the cafeteria.\"\nDividers in the cafeteria split the different ages. While staff and children have made the most out of the space, Johnson said, it has limited the number of activities and stimulated learning.\nThe dedicated classrooms will create a better learning environment for the children, Morrell said, one that is more akin to the Easton Elementary site that already has two full classrooms. Johnson and Morrell said it's important for children in before- and after-school care to have a consistent space they go to each day that creates a familiar environment.\nWhile the state is taking on efforts to provide accessible child care to families, facilities across Talbot County are limited in spacing and staffing. Many are forced to turn parents and guardians in need away or add them to extensive waitlists.\nBarbra Diaz, the director of the Talbot County Center for Children and Families, said the county's Early Head Start program has a waitlist. The federally funded program serves children under 3 and focuses on serving those below the federal poverty line.\nDiaz has administered the program since January, and the number one hurdle has been staffing, she said. Currently, the program is only taking in 20 of a possible 40 kids due to state-mandated staff-child ratios.\nIn Easton, The Lab Child Care Center provides care for over 100 children between its Cynwood Drive and Creamery Lane locations. Owner John Givens, who also runs The Lab Martial Arts and Fitness Center, said there's a rolling waitlist for children under two.\nGivens said The Lab faces the challenge of adjusting to rising costs required to provide child care and a new state scholarship program that hasn't yet worked out all its kinks. As a for-profit business, he said he has to balance doing as much as possible for families in need while also keeping the business afloat.\n\"It's kind of a double-edged sword,\" Givens said. \"From an owner/operator perspective, infants and toddlers in general are the most labor-intensive, they're the most expensive to care for.\"\n\"All parents who have kids who don't have a support network need day care,\" Givens continued. \"And I think the day care game in Talbot County is stretched very thin.\"\nCORDOVA EXPANSIONThe expansion of the Cordova facility, doubling capacity from 30 to 60 will help that situation, said Christy Morrell, the executive director.\nFor parents and guardians, Morrell says having a dependable place to drop off their children provides peace of mind.\n\"They're better employees, they're more consistent employees,\" Morrell said of parents who have a reliable day care service.\nDespite challenges in available space, Critchlow's Cordova site has remained at the peak of the state's quality rating system for child care and early education programs, Maryland EXCELS. It's accredited and has a Level 5 rating, the highest rank. Those efforts, though, have taken years of dedication and funding.\nCritchlow's upcoming Cordova expansion totals around $1.82 million, not including an outdoor playground and indoor furniture. Critchlow is working to fundraise that mark, helped in part by a $300,000 boost from the Talbot County Council in American Rescue Plan funding.\nJust last week, funding for child care was stressed at the state level when Gov. Wes Moore and the Maryland Board of Public Works approved $148.3 million in state budget cuts. The cuts are intended to make way for Medicaid and child care efforts by the state.\nHowever, Morrell is concerned that those cuts may actually hurt funding for child care in Maryland's rural counties. She pointed to a 25% reduction in funding for the Rural Maryland Council, which is run under the Department of Agriculture.\nThe grantmaking cut for the council reduces what was $9 million to $6.75 million available. Morrell had hoped to receive a council grant to contribute to expansion costs.\nSTATE PROGRAMThe state cuts are, in part, meant to increase the state's ability to accommodate a rising number of families in the Maryland State Department of Education's Child Care Scholarship Program. According to the Department of Education, about 42,000 children are enrolled. Eligible families receive aid in the form of vouchers that go to licensed providers, such as The Lab.\nThe program is meant to help families afford high-quality child care programs, which falls in line with the state's Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a state education initiative.\nGivens calls it a \"fantastic program in theory,\" one that allows parents with children to maintain jobs. However, he believes its issue \"is in the implementation.\"\nHe says the program's shortcomings cause late payments, and sometimes his business is providing six to eight weeks of service without payment.\n\"It's a scary world when you have back pay that's months or years old that you're trying to track down and chase down to get,\" Givens said. \"As an owner/operator, that is a scary thing.\"\nIn a statement to The Star Democrat, the state Department of Education said the program \"exhibits no systemic issues concerning timely payment processing for providers.\" The department pointed to its advanced payment practice that ensures timely payments, a practice mandated at the federal level.\nIf scholarship enrollments include additional children after advanced payment is calculated, accurate payments to providers are delayed. The state said it is in the process of reducing that delay period.\n\"MSDE recognizes the need to reduce the True-Up reconciliation period from 90 days to 30 days for providers receiving payments from the Child Care Scholarship program,\" a portion of the statement read. \"This reduced turnaround time requires technological changes in backend systems, and MSDE is currently working on those changes.\"\nWhile Givens said The Lab has always accommodated its families and children, he said the state's scholarship program is putting day care providers in a middle position.\nAnd in some cases, that may end up yielding a dilemma: provide a much-needed service to a family or ensure one's business remains profitable. It's a problem he said reigns true at a national level.\nGivens said child care should be considered a \"critical part of infrastructure,\" such as roads.\n\"We have to support it that way,\" Givens said. \"We have to figure out a way that all kids who should have care, can have care.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Like a three-legged stool, the community as a whole must come together with MSDE and Maryland READS for success to stand up, she said.\nMaryland READS recently wrapped up its summer series convenings to build networks and establish planning networks across the state, according to Maryland READS member Fred Curtis.\nThe READ Strong conveyings in Baltimore City and Queen Anne's and Montgomery counties saw stakeholders from a variety of different sectors, nonprofit executives, school board members and educators, he said.\nThese meetings provide ideas for a backbone of how to establish strong reading ecosystems rooted in the science of reading, he said. County convenings are instrumental in helping assist in sort of planning these efforts to bring people together and identifying what private ecosystems look like throughout different jurisdictions.\n\"For us, local experience, local expertise and relationships truly matter and they are imperative,\" Curtis said.\nMaryland READS will compile the data from the meetings for implementing feedback and continuous improvement, he said.\nOther events on the horizon for Maryland READS include additional READ Strong Network meetings in the fall, Happy Hour Conversations, and upcoming discussions to revolve around upcoming testing score releases.\nThe board expressed gratitude for the work of Maryland READS as a reminder of the individuals dedicated to the reading proficiency of all students and looked forward to progress.\nMaryland READS is actively recruiting for new board members for representation throughout the state and is accepting recommendations for its Expert Advisory Committee.\nMore information about Maryland READS, including its complete report on the state literacy crisis, can be found at https://marylandreads.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Considerations of the working policy include aspects such as curriculum adoption, assessment data, analysis, early warning systems, intervention and accountability.\nThe proposed policy aims to help the State Board of Education clarify and develop the more rigorous requirements already embedded in state statutes, according to Deann Collins, deputy state superintendent, and Tenette Smith, executive director of literacy programs and initiatives.\nThe proposed policy emphasizes the importance of economic issues and addressing literacy at a young age, Collins said.\nThe drafters welcomed feedback from a multitude of stakeholders, as well as reviewed other state policies, Smith said.\nAnother important aspect was ensuring the policy could articulate goals and align with the Blueprint for Maryland's Future's goals for improving literacy outcomes, she said.\nAchievement gaps in literacy persist across state demographics, according to Collins. Research suggests \"reading is an economic issue as well as an education issue,\" Smith said.\nMany Maryland students are not meeting reading grade level expectations \"and this gap has profound implications for the overall academic success and future and their future opportunities,\" she said.\nAccording to the 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 31% of Maryland students scored at proficiency levels or advanced, \"Which means a staggering 69 percent of our students did not reach proficiency,\" Smith said.\nThese findings underscore the urgent need for a unified comprehensive approach to ensure that all students develop strong reading skills early in their education to support their long-term academic success and high school graduation, she said. Research from the Annie E. Casey Foundation emphasized the critical importance of early reading proficiency.\n\"88% of students who failed to earn a diploma were struggling readers in third grade,\" Collins said.\nThe stakes are even higher for children living in poverty and are from a minority, according to Smith, who face a eight times more likelihood of not graduating on time if they lack reading proficiency by third grade.\nFour major components of the comprehensive literacy policy draft spotlight teacher support, assessment and parent notification, instruction and intervention, and retention and intervention.\n\"By improving literacy outcomes we can enhance the economic and social wellbeing of our communities,\" she said.\nAreas for additional consideration include addressing staffing models and class sizes, strategic training as well as how to hold students accountable, Collins said.\nThe draft policy is still in its early stages, and the department was grateful for stakeholders and partner collaboration to spotlight where work needs to be focused, she said.\nWith over 900 responses collected already, the office of the superintendent continues to receive input and feedback can be submitted at the MSDE website.\nNo final decision has been made regarding the policy and additional work is needed to finalize a timeline. Another revisited policy is expected to be presented for board action at a later date.\n\"This is just the beginning,\" Wright said.\nPublic comment about the literacy policy is expected, and the MSBOE will next meet Aug. 27.\nMore information about the MSDE can be found at marylandpublicschools.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The six-week work program gives students with learning disabilities and handicaps not only a path get out into the workforce, but many retain their jobs after completing the course.These teens do all kinds of things across five counties like washing dishes, taking movie tickets at a theater and working at a day care center. There are lots of different businesses who are willing to work with these students like Aaron's Place, Dorchester Parks and Recreation and the Kent County Animal Shelter.\nOne student learned data entry so thoroughly that he was teaching his employer a few tips.\nAs their names were to get their diploma, some were shy and some were triumphant with their arms in the air. Most were dressed up for the event. The crowd clapped enthusiastically for every kid. There were tears of joy as parents snapped cell phone pictures of their child in front of the balloon-covered backdrop.\n\"We are here to celebrate our summer youth connections program that we do for youth in the Upper Shore from Kent all the way down to Dorchester,\" said Dan Schneckenburger, executive director of Upper Shore Workforce Investment Board. \"Students with any kind of learning disabilities or handicaps, we place them with the employer. We off job coaching along the way.\"\nHe said this was the culmination of their achievement and their first job. He says they work with employers and with Division of Rehabilitation Services, which is part of The Maryland Department of Education.\n\"For a lot of these kids this six-week program is their first paid work experience. YMCA, animal shelters, restaurants. One kid liked IT. We placed him at the St. Michael's library,\" he said.\nCase manager Elizabeth Chiocca watched with pride as the kids got their diplomas.\n\"It is hard for local youth to find jobs and this gives them a stepping stone that they need,\" Chiocca said. \"Some of the businesses are actually hiring our students.\"\nYouth coordinator Deborah Boulden said she likes the intake part, where other people have written these students off.\n\"Because they do have a disability, some people write them off,\" Boulden said. \"We take them as they are and don't write them off. And we make diamonds.\"\nBoulden spoke to the crowd from a lectern. She was proud of many students who not only completed the six-week program, but stayed at their place of employment to keep working.\nMason Callis worked as a \"dishwasher at Mamma Mia's in Sudlersville, Maryland. Clean dishes, sweeping floor out in the lobby and in the kitchen. And washing and more dishes. I like my job very much, and I am a hard-working person.\"\nSavannah Quinn had a clerical job at Chesapeake College with tasks like shredding paper and making name tags for folders.\nOne successful multi-year participant in the program is Connor Swann. He is 21 now and was a keynote speaker at the event.\n\"Miss Debbie and Miss Elizabeth helped me get jobs. I started in ninth grade. One job was Chesapeake Cats and Dogs and the other was Talbot Humane Society. That helped me get great skills toward working with animals,\" Swann said. \"Right now I work at Dogwood Acres Pet Retreat in Kent Island. I am starting to train people now. I completed the veterinary assistant program at Chesapeake College. I am getting my associates degree in liberal arts. Then it is off to the real world of working.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Colman said a lot of those tutors were Dorchester County teachers, and so they were only able to provide services after school at night.\nElementary school students requiring services outside of school will still receive tutoring as the Edmentum agreement is only for secondary students in the district.\nUnder the agreement, Dorchester County schools will be able to offer secondary students enrollment in the Edmentum courses on an as-need basis.\nColman said the service will cost $200 per student per course. She said she doesn't know exactly how much it will cost the district in total as that is dependent on how many students will need to enroll, but she estimates the total cost will be somewhere around $100,000.\n\"I don't know if we'll use that much or we'll need more,\" she said. \"Based on our students, last year, we would have needed more than $100,000, but we're going to see how that goes right now.\"\nThe district will get billed monthly for up to $100,000 for the service.\nAt the meeting, board Vice President Talibah Chikwendu asked about funding the service and how the district will pay for it if costs go over budget. Colman said some money can be moved from the budgeted line item for home hospital services tutor stipends and the district can also use Title IV or Title V funds.\nNEW SCHOOL YEARAt the end of the meeting on Thursday, board members wished everyone in the district a great start to the school year.\n\"Parents, you're about to turn over your kids to us, and we're going to give them our very best,\" board President Sheri Hubbard said.\nFor Dorchester County Public Schools first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and ninth graders, the first day of school will be Sept. 3. For seventh, eighth, 10th, 11th and 12th graders, the first day of school will be Sept. 4. For pre-K and kindergarteners, the first day of school will be Sept. 5.\nSuperintendent Jymil Thompson said he thinks the district is off to a great start to the school year. He said the professional development that teachers have been receiving has been \"excellent.\"\n\"I just think the whole team has energy,\" he said. \"Because I think that everyone is focusing on what we're in the business of doing. And that is instruction.\"\nSince becoming interim superintendent in March and then superintendent in June, Thompson has talked about the need to increase the district's ranking from 23rd to 15th in the state.\n\"I just want to make sure we keep the main thing the main thing,\" he said at the end of the meeting, \"and that's moving from 23rd to 15th.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In front of the building, participants inscribed chalk messages on the sidewalk.\n\"People love the school systems here. The future lives in that building,\" Mitchell said, pointing to nearby Centreville Elementary.\n\"It's deeply frustrating that QACPS wants to cut some of our lowest-paid educators who work directly with our students, and at the start of the year, no less. We don't know how many people, or what job titles,\" Mitchell said in a statement ahead of Tuesday's rally. \"There are any number of ways to deal with budget problems, but not if you won't talk to your educators.\"\nAccording to a press release issued by the Association, they were notified on Aug. 14 of the potential layoffs of \"an unknown number of QACPS support staff, who are among the lowest-paid employees in QACPS.\"\nThe Association seeks the superintendent and school board to address the budget shortfall before pushing it on to employees, Mitchell said.\nThe layoffs announcement came after the school district asked Queen Anne's County educators on Aug. 12 to accept five unpaid furlough days during the 2024-25 school year.\nThe educators association said they asked for documentation to justify the furloughs and were \"sent no response nor documentation, and then refused to meet on any of the dates offered to discuss the matter.\"\nSeeking budget transparency, the Association has filed a formal information request, with questions including where the money was going, and what is being done that doesn't involve cutting positions, according to Mitchell.\n\"So, we just have two questions for Dr. Saelens. First, why are you asking us to cut our salaries if you won't ask the county for additional funding, and second, why won't QACPS answer our questions about the budget crisis like the law requires?\" Mitchell said.\nOther measures needed to be exhausted first before the proposed Reduction In Force and layoffs of essential support staff, she said.\nMitchell highlighted the effect layoffs would have on the livelihood of support staff, who ensure the optimal running of the school, while making up the smallest portion of school system employees, \"And they make the least amount of money,\" she said.\nAccording to a statement from Superintendent Patricia Saelens, the school system sought to balance the budget through attrition.\nSaelens noted the \"severely underfunded Blueprint For Maryland's Schools, coupled with overall inflation has created a recipe of frustration\" — a deficit that Queen Anne's County is not alone in facing, she said.\nAs a result of that lack of attrition there is still a current shortfall of two million dollars. Saelens wrote in a letter to staff on Aug. 19, \"This summer, we have worked to do a detailed budget analysis and determine what could be cut to put those funds into salaries. We have identified numerous items to help reduce the budget shortfall. We will cut scanning, tutoring and locally funded conferences. We will reduce our legal line item. We will cut school block grants by 10%.\"\nAdditionally Saelens wrote the district is canceling the Cenergistic Energy contract, and repurposing the staff tuition reimbursement line. \"While these measures will help, it is simply not enough to balance the budget,\" she stated, \"Under Maryland Law, a local board of education is prohibited from carrying a budget deficit.\"\nSaelens contends the district met with the union on July 18 and 31 to discuss a retirement incentive and potential furlough days. The retirement incentive was not successful as only two employees took advantage, still leaving them under the attrition necessary to balance the budget.\nTogether with the union, Saelens said they selected dates that purposely would not impact student days. \"We also determined the proposed furlough days would be for all employee units, including the superintendent and all administrative staff. These proposed five days would have avoided the need to reduce any member of our staff,\" she said, \"We know that each of our employees are vital to the successes of students. It was our intention to keep our staff whole.\"\nSaelens said they provided the union with all the information they requested within 24 hours, meeting again on Aug. 6 and sharing a draft MOU regarding proposed furlough days.\nGiven the upcoming start of the school year, we requested that they provide us with their decision by Aug. 12, Saelens said. The union responded in writing informing leadership that they \"formally decline Queen Anne's County Public Schools proposal of furlough days for the 2024-2025 school year\".\nAs a result, Reduction In Force (RIF) letters were issued on Aug. 14, in accordance with the RIF process outlined in the negotiated agreement, Saelens concluded.\nWhether proposed furlough dates or RIF, the teacher's union has a ratified contract based on an offer the BOE presented to the union that was accepted, according to Mitchell.\n\"We must take care of each other,\" she said.\nShowing support for fellow union members and district bus drivers, Tony Mansfield stated the rally was a \"good start\" and sought collaborative efforts to come up with a budget that does not include reductions and a solution that honors the contract ratified in June.\nSchool psychologist Julie Rock, of Matapeake Middle School and Kent Island Elementary School, stated it was her job to advocate for students and the rally highlighted the invaluableness of the various support needed within the walls of the schools. \"Right now, the students that need us the most are going to be losing the support,\" Rock said.\nStanding alongside QACEA was Lori Hrinko, President of Cecil County Classroom Teachers Association. \"This isn't about you wanting more, this is about what's right for our kids,\" Hrinko told the crowd.\nHrinko encouraged everyone to be involved in their school districts, as students represented the future generations.\nQACEA is a local affiliate of the Maryland State Education Association (MSEA), which in turn is an affiliate of the National Education Association, and Mitchell voiced appreciation of the organizations' support.\nWorking to promote change through action, Mitchell hoped to inspire students of all ages and showcase that change is possible.\nMitchell noted issues cannot be addressed by avoiding dialog or shifting blame, \"Problems can only be solved with conversation, creative solutions and direct contact,\" she said.\nMoving forward, Mitchell seeks to have all groups unite with the same underlying goal: identify the best interests for the good of students. \"[Working] together; real numbers, real decisions,\" Mitchell said.\nMore information about QACEA can be found at https://qacea.org.\nThe Board of Education will next meet for a regular meeting Sept. 4 at 6 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One side includes a screenshot from the U.S. News & World Report's web page on the district's finances. \"And what are taxpayers getting for all this money?\" the flyer reads.\nOn the other side, it reads: \"Despite all of this spending, math proficiency for students in Talbot County stands at a dismal 17.2%, well below the state average. It doesn't add up! With all this taxpayer money being spent, what are they teaching our kids?\"\nTalbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi briefly addressed the mailers during an Aug. 14 Board of Education meeting.\n\"There (were) inaccurate monetary figures on that card, number one,\" Pepukayi said. \"Yes, I will say we have work to do in the area of math, and that's one of our priorities.\"\nThe superintendent said there will be a Board of Education work session in September to show recent state testing data that is currently embargoed. The state average math proficiency rate for the 2022-23 school year was about 25%, according to the Maryland Department of Education.\nReturn addresses indicate the mailers were sent by Pay Attention America Inc., with an address listed as 1000 N. West St. in Wilmington, Delaware.\nThe group's registered agent is listed online through the Delaware Department of State as The Corporation Trust Company, also located in Wilmington. The company offers registered agent services and has provided these services to more than 300,000 businesses, according to its website.\nRepresentatives from The Corporation Trust told The Star Democrat that Pay Attention America is newly formed, and thus, no contact information can be publicly provided since the group hasn't filed an annual tax report.\nThough not confirmed to be behind the mailers, a website with a domain of payattentionamerica.com describes itself as a \"group of concerned citizens across the United States of America joined to combat the decline of our beloved country.\" No contact information or addresses are listed on the website.\nAs of Tuesday evening, The Star Democrat has not received a response from a contact form submitted on the website payattentionamerica.com.\nResident Hilary Spence received the flyer in her mailbox on Aug. 9. She was most struck by \"the anonymity\" of the mailers for such a small community. \"It's hard to have dialogue with nobody to (have) dialogue with,\" she said.\n\"That's what offends me the most, to be honest, as a local resident supportive of public schools,\" Spence said. \" … It's like if you have something to say to me … say it to my face.\"\nEaston resident Shari Wilcoxon had a different stance on the mailers.\n\"I was actually pretty excited to see that someone was willing to tell the truth to the public,\" Wilcoxon said. \"Because I feel like most people have absolutely no idea of the state of the education system in Maryland.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bands from the district's schools joined together to welcome staff, and many other students performed and introduced speakers for the gathering.\nJeremy Hillyard, the district's 2024-2025 Teacher of the Year, and Rosario Steele, the district's 2024-2025 Support Staff of the Year, were each presented with a 2025 Chevrolet Trax from Hertrich Chevy Buick GMC of Easton.\nGeneral Manager Pat Papineau thanked Hillyard, Steele and all of the district's teachers for their dedication to their professions.\n\"I imagine that a lot of people think that your guys' job starts a few minutes before the kids get there and ends a few minutes after the kids leave,\" Papineau said. \"That couldn't be farther from the truth. … It's pretty much nonstop. You're continuously trying to improve yourself, you're continuously investing in yourself, you're continuously investing in your students.\"\nHillyard, a Spanish and English second language math teacher at Easton High, and Steele, an instructional assistant for English second language students, both delivered speeches to the crowd.\n\"Each of us in this room plays an important role in our students' stories,\" Hillyard said. \"And it's our job and up to us to make that role a supporting one by always having their backs.\"\n\"This job has been the most rewarding experience in my life,\" Steele said. \"I have witnessed those students that start as ninth graders with very little English inspire me when I see them in the community after graduation.\"\nMany other awards were handed out during the event. AJ Rojas, the district's facilitator of interpretation and translation, was presented with the Wardell Brine Multicultural Award. Robin Werner, director of teaching and learning, was named winner of the Brewster Merrill Technology Award.\nNamed after a past superintendent, the J. Sam Meek Unsung Hero Award was presented to three staff members: Charlotte Compton and Heather Ewing, teachers at Easton Elementary, and George Larrimore, a bus driver since 2010.\nMOVING FORWARDDistrict Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi closed Thursday morning's festivities with a speech indicating major areas for the district to focus on. Some examples were staffing, transportation, dress code and student behavior.\n\"I believe in bite-sized chunks and taking it slow, so that it's not a lot and it doesn't seem overwhelming,\" Pepukayi said.\nShe noted that adding mentors for incoming teachers and math coaches has been successful for the district. Pepukayi said the district will begin working on a new four-year strategic plan, as the current plan wraps up in 2025.\nAt the end of her speech, Pepukayi indicated the district is maintaining its three priorities of improvement heading into the 2024-2025 school year: academic equity in math, an \"engaging\" environment for students and staff, and recruiting and retaining a more diverse staff.\n\"We're going to stay the course with these three priorities as we continue to move into this next year of transforming and performing together,\" Pepukayi said. \n\n © Copyright 2024",

The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company is leading construction, which started Aug. 5.\nA short ceremony outside the school provided attendees insight into the renovations and what benefits will follow. Speakers included Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi, Principal Kari Clow, Talbot County Council President Chuck Callahan, Board of Education President Emily Jackson, Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers Executive Director Cristy Morrell and two students, Abdiel Santamaria and Laney Childress.\n\"This groundbreaking ceremony symbolizes not just the start of construction, but the beginning of a vision coming to life,\" Clow said. \"A vision of a school that will provide an environment where our students can thrive, learn and grow into the leaders of tomorrow.\"\nConstruction on the multimillion-dollar project is expected to take a couple years. The school was built in 1952 and last renovated in 1994.\nDuring Friday's groundbreaking ceremony, Pepukayi thanked the school's teachers and staff and emphasized safety is a top priority as the school year begins and construction continues.\n\"Together the Chapel District Elementary School staff has shown patience and flexibility to work with Whiting-Turner and associates, keeping safety a priority while the project moves forward,\" Pepukayi said.\nThe Talbot County Council allocated a projected $26.9 million in capital project funding to Talbot County Public Schools for the renovations. That funding is expected to span across both fiscal years 2025 and 2026.\nThis April, the state's Interagency Commission on School Construction unanimously approved a $3.8 million funding request for the project. Lisa Vaughn, capital project manager for the commission, said on Friday that the \"kids are worth every penny.\"\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, the project includes a full renovation of the existing building and around 16,000 square feet of additions. There will be additional learning space for the school, as well as the Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers site located in the building.\nThe school's media center is moving to the center of the building, and the playground is also under renovation.\nOn behalf of the board, Jackson thanked the county and state for funding the renovation.\n\"Funding these improvements for our cherished elementary school shows the collective commitment, not only to education, not only to rural education, but to rural education for our earliest learners,\" Jackson said. \"It does not go unappreciated or unnoticed.\"\nFollowing the ceremony, administrators, teachers, staff and students took turns shoveling the dirt to commemorate the beginning of construction. \n\n (c) Copyright 2024",

Results showed a 0.5% statewide increase in English proficiency and a 0.8% statewide increase in math proficiency. 48.4% of students tested proficient in English, and 24.1% of students tested proficient in math.\nTalbot, Caroline and Dorchester counties all fall below these state averages, though those three districts did increase in English and math proficiency from the 2022-2023 school year.\nTALBOTThe 2023-2024 results show Talbot County Public Schools saw an increase in English and math proficiency, while following state trends with dips in science scores.\nEnglish proficiency increased 2.8% to be 47.3% proficient, which ranks 14th in the state out of 24 districts. Math proficiency increased 1.1% to be 18.3% proficient, which ranks 18th in the state.\nScience levels for TCPS dropped along with the state, as Talbot County fell from 29.5% to 16.9% proficiency in fifth grade science. The county dropped from 30% to 20.1% in eighth grade science. District-wide rankings fell four spots for each category, as Talbot is now 19th in fifth grade science and 16th in eighth grade science.\n\"The 23-24 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment results showed modest improvement across all MD Districts,\" Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said in a statement emailed to the Star Democrat. \"In Talbot County, our overall margin of progress as a district was slightly larger than what the State achieved as a whole. These results will inform our continued work on the initiatives that we put in place to provide our educators with the resources needed to ensure student success. We also know that student success is measured by many indicators in addition to state assessment scores.\"\nCAROLINETendencies for Caroline County Public Schools in math and reading proficiency align with state trends. However, like Talbot, Caroline County dropped in rankings for science proficiency.\nEnglish proficiency rose 2.1% to 45.3%. Math proficiency rose 3.9% to 19.7%. Both rankings slot Caroline County at 15th statewide.\nCaroline County's proficiency marks went from 34.4% to 17% in fifth grade science and 22.1% to 19.3% in eighth grade science. The district's rankings fell from 13th to 18th in fifth grade science and 15th to 17th in eighth grade science.\nDORCHESTERWhile Dorchester County Public Schools still ranks in the bottom four for English and math proficiency rates, the district did see year-to-year increases in those two categories.\nIn English, the district rose 1.4% to 33.7% proficiency, which ranks 22nd in the state. In math, the district rose 1% to 12.3% proficiency, which ranks 21st in the state.\nDorchester County's science proficiency marks went from 23.5% to 14.4% at the fifth grade level, and from 19.1% to 15.3% at the eighth grade level. Its fifth grade science ranking, though, did increase from 22nd to 20th. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Plans to address test scores, cell phones shared by district staff at Moms for Liberty meeting\n\n August 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On Monday evening, Talbot County's chapter of Moms for Liberty, a nationwide conservative political organization, held a meeting with Sharon Pepukayi, superintendent of Talbot County Public Schools, and other district professionals.During this meeting, attendees shared their concerns about the state of education in Talbot County, including low math scores, and student cell phone use.\nJan Greenhawk, chapter chair for Moms for Liberty, expressed gratitude for the attendance of the district representatives, including Debbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools; Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent for school leadership and Student Success; and Vulieka Jarmon-Horsey, assistant superintendent of administrative services, systems and strategies.\n\"Y'all don't realize what a privilege it is to have a superintendent and a school board and her staff that will come in and talk to your group and answer questions,\" Greenhawk said. \"Believe me when I say that because I have friends who are chapter chairs on the western shore. That does not happen.\"\nGreenhawk noted there may be times \"we disagree, and that's okay, but we can talk through issues.\"\nDuring the meeting, Pepukayi shared news of a research-based math and English language arts curriculums that will be implemented in schools.\nIn addition to the new curriculum, the county has added some positions to help, such as math coaches. According to Pepukayi, while these changes are important, it is essential to roll it out slowly so as to not overwhelm teachers.\nPepukayi's emphasis on changes to the math curriculum comes after an anonymous countywide postcard was mailed to county residents criticizing Talbot County Public Schools.\nThe 14-by-8.5-inch, two-sided post cards were sent out to the residents of Talbot County last week. The flyers included a screenshot from the U.S. News & World Report's web page on the district's finances, and on the other side they shared that Talbot County students' math proficiency stands 17.2% below the state average.\nShari Wilcoxon, an attendee of the meeting, expressed concern over the postcards that were sent to residents. She told representatives in the meeting that there will be \"multiple other ones coming out.\"\nThe following morning, a second round of similar postcards arrived in residents' mailboxes. Instead of addressing math scores, this postcard addressed English proficiency, stating that 59% of students in third through eighth grade are not proficient in English.\nCELL PHONE USE\nDuring the question-and-answer portion of the meeting, several attendees asked for the district's overall stance on student cell phone usage during school hours. Pepukayi shared the district's policy on cell phone usage may be different from what is practiced in the classroom.\nPepukayi said the district is piloting a new program called YONDER as a way to limit cell phone usage in the classroom.\n\"It's a cell phone pouch, and what it is is a student comes into school, they put their cell phone in this pouch, and it locks,\" Pepukayi said.\nAccording to Pepukayi, the pouches will stay with the students and will be locked all day until they leave and press the pouch up against a magnet, which will allow them access to their cell phones.\nPepukayi said the roll out of the pouches have not begun yet. The district would need to communicate the plan with families and have a board presentation on it. The draft plan is to start rollout after Thanksgiving.\nRobert Jurrius, a math teacher at Easton Middle School, said it is difficult for students to stay off their cell phones, but it is made worse by parents who text their kids during school hours.\n\"I'm going to say with all authority that I can muster, (parents) need to break that addiction that you have to be able to reach a child every time anything occurs,\" Jurrius said.\nToward the end of the meeting, Pepukayi said it was important for her to take the time to talk to community groups and hear their concerns. It falls under the district's theme of \"transforming and performing together.\"\n\"I'm a big proponent of people knowing the facts, and number two, making sure we're partnering with anyone who wants to help our Talbot County Public students be successful,\" Pepukayi said. \"And so whatever that looks like, we'll partner and we'll talk about the issues.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This equates to a total county allocation of $75.1 million plus an additional $42.1 million in state funding, for a total operating budget of $118,400,000 for FY 25, according to Moran.\n\"However, the board is currently operating with a projected budgetary deficit just six weeks into FY 25 and there are concerns that this trend will continue to get worse in the coming years,\" he said.\nThe commissioners reiterated the audit was \"not a witch hunt\" but a means in which to support the Board of Education including assistance in identifying resources, guidelines, and best practices with the County's Finance Department and the Spending Affordability Committee.\nCommissioner Chris Corchiarino noted when things go wrong some people have a tendency to get caught up in the blame game and not put forth viable solutions.\n\"We want to fix things,\" he said.\nCommissioner Jack Wilson noted the audit would be a good first step and \"huge push toward transparency across the board\" and with the current fiscal state of Maryland, time was of the essence.\nCommissioner Phil Dumenil noted Superintendent Patrica Saelens, the Board of Education, and leadership have been \"more than cooperative\" regarding the endeavor and a review of the financial books.\nWith the Board of Education's next fiscal year budget process beginning soon, work is underway narrowing down potential firms to expedite the auditing process as quickly as possible, and no final schedule has been set, County Administrator Todd Mohn said.\nThe audit is capped not to exceed $100,000. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

At the conclusion of school, a magnetic, unlocking device lets the students unlock the pouches and retrieve their phones.\nCaroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said middle school was the right level to implement the test of the technology.\n\"Middle school students are wrestling with a lot of things, a lot of changes,\" Simmons said. \"There's a lot going on for kids at that time, a lot of research is talking about the impact of devices on kids at that age in particular.\"\nAs Caroline County pilots the Yondr pouches, Talbot and Dorchester counties are preparing for implementation later this fall. Across the board, there is a common goal of improving in areas such as student achievement, attendance and discipline.\nSimmons said his district attempted to take a strict stance on cell phone usage after the pandemic. However, teachers and administrators found it hard to enforce the policies in large classrooms and settings.\n\"The devil was in the details of implementation,\" Simmons said. \"Saying it and getting folks to be able to monitor was really hard. … Being able to keep an eye on every kid who's (looking at a phone) … it's impossible.\"\nThe pouches cost about $30 each. Simmons said Yondr believes the pouches will last three to four years.\nDorchester County Public Schools will be implementing a similar pilot later this school year. Valerie Goff, DCPS communication and community outreach specialist, said the district is hoping to begin its pilot before the end of October for middle school students only.\nTalbot County Public Schools may follow suit soon thereafter. At an Aug. 26 Moms for Liberty meeting with school administration, TCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the district hopes to roll out the same Yondr pouches after Thanksgiving.\nPepukayi and Easton Middle School math teacher Robert Jurrius responded to questions about access to cell phones in the event of a school emergency.\n\"I need you to pay attention when something bad is happening,\" Jurrius said on Aug 26. \"And there is no circumstance where a child looking at their phone at that moment is going to be safer. Parents might feel better that they can reach their child, but they're actually endangering their child.\"\n\"What I've heard from the emergency response and the crisis management people,\" Pepukayi said, \"is they want students to be able to listen to the directions of where they need to go and what they need to do versus being distracted in looking at their phone.\"\nSimmons said the same regarding the situation of a school emergency while kids' phones are locked in pouches. \"If there's an absolute emergency, we need the kids to focus in on their teacher,\" he said.\nIn Caroline County Public Schools, Simmons said the district will track if there's a decrease in student discipline or increases in student focus and achievement. If results are positive, the policy could extend to other schools in the district.\nWhile the superintendent did say the high school level \"presents an interesting dilemma\" and a need for balance as students are being prepared for adulthood, it's the next step if Caroline County's pilot yields improvements.\n\"If we do see positive impacts in the middle, it absolutely warrants that we look at it at our high schools in some settings,\" Simmons said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "For Dorchester superintendent, it's all about teaching and learning\n\n September 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 746\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — When Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson stepped into a third grade classroom at Sandy Hill Elementary during one of the first weeks of the school year, he saw sheer energy.\"They might have been doing a social emotional learning lesson,\" Thompson recalled. \"And the kids were so involved. They were standing up in their chairs. And the teacher was so energetic.\"\nEveryone was engaged. And for the student that didn't want to get involved, the teacher had him help her with the lesson on the computer so that he was still participating.\nNeither the third grade teacher nor the school's principal knew Thompson would be stopping by Sandy Hill Elementary that day.\n\"And so you know it wasn't a dog and pony show,\" he said.\nFor Thompson, who visits the school system's buildings and classrooms every week, the reason for these visits isn't to catch principals and teachers doing the wrong thing. It's to create a comfortable atmosphere of teaching and learning and to offer guidance when needed.\n\"I used to be a principal, I used to be assistant principal and teacher,\" Thompson said. \"So I want to make sure that they are comfortable with me and know I'm here to help better them and get them supports to be better.\"\nSince becoming superintendent in June, Thompson has made known his hope of bringing the district's ranking up from 23rd to 15th in the state. In an effort to do this in four years, the district has identified different steps to making that happen.\nThis year, the district is focusing on instructional leadership, taking a top-down approach in an effort to improve student success. Thompson considers instructional leadership — or leadership that focuses on teaching and learning — as his top priority this school year.\n\"Outside of the teacher, administration has the most impact on student achievement, without a doubt,\" he said, adding that because principals oversee the entire school, and not just one classroom, they have the most impact on student achievement.\nJodi Colman, assistant superintendent of academics and student services, said that Dorchester County is usually toward the bottom when it comes to rankings among the other school districts in the state.\n\"And at this point in time, the only way we're going to change that rating and our students are going to start performing at higher academic levels is (if we) focus on instructional leadership within the school system,\" she said.\nIn March, the Dorchester County Board of Education approved a purchasing agreement to bring coaching and professional development support for district administrators.\nThompson, the then-interim superintendent, said at the March 25 board meeting that the district executive team expects all its principals to become \"great instructional leaders,\" but not enough professional development has been provided to those leaders.\nOn Sept. 16, Thompson said this professional development support includes leadership meetings twice per month that focus on how administrators should give feedback to teachers on how to improve in the classroom.\n\"Making sure that (administrators are) continually developing (teachers') skills to deliver the best instruction to the kids,\" he said.\nIn order to jump from 23rd in the state to 15th in four years, Thompson said the district will need to be consistent with developing instructional leadership and follow through on it.\n\"Making sure that I'm having meetings with the principals, having conversations on how they're progressing on their goals,\" he said. \"And if they're not progressing, how can we shift and go in a little different direction to ensure that they're meeting their goals?\"\nThompson thinks one of the biggest challenges the district faces this year will be getting people comfortable with change and holding them accountable to those changes. He said that often, people automatically think accountability is negative, but when you don't hold people accountable, you end up doing them a disservice.\n\"We don't want to fire anybody,\" he said. \"We want people to do what they were hired to do. And we want to be able to provide the supports when people are struggling at their craft, and then help them improve their craft. When we talk about accountability, that's what we mean.\"\nColman said that change can be uncomfortable. She said she hopes that by the end of the year, people in the district will find a comfort in being uncomfortable.\n\"We're only going to make this move if we all know that we've got the same target and (know) that we're all going to have to push ourselves to probably go and do things that we're not normally used to doing,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot school board sees test scores, improvement initiatives\n\n September 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 836\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — State test scores released last month show a slight increase in math and English proficiency levels at both the district and state levels.Talbot County's Board of Education discussed that trend and others during a work session on Monday, taking a first deep dive into the test results from 2023-2024's Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program.\nIn English, 47.3% of Talbot County Public Schools students tested proficient, a jump of 2.8% from 44.5% in 2022-2023. In math, 18.3% of students were proficient, up 1.1% from 17.2% the year prior. The district slots in 14th and 18th, respectively, in those categories among the state's 24 districts.\nENGLISH TRENDS\"One of the things that the board is always interested in is how does Talbot County Public Schools compare to other districts in the state,\" said Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership, while presenting the English results. \"And I wish that I could give you better news and say that we have flip-flopped the map, but if you compare this year's results to last year across the state, you will see very little change. There is not a single district in the state who is leapfrogging in improvements on this map.\"\nEinhorn and Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi emphasized that the district internally tracks student learning levels. This is done at benchmarks throughout the year.\n\"I can assure this board that more than 47% of our students are mastering grade level standards,\" Einhorn said of the English proficiency rate. \"It's just that they are not showing it across the state on this particular assessment.\"\nSome positives for the English rates included third grade proficiency and the growth for certain cohorts and subgroups. Third grade English proficiency saw a significant jump from the 2022-2023 school year.\nEinhorn pointed out that in 2023, sixth grade students were 40.1% proficient. That same group of students came in at 43.8% proficient on the seventh grade test. \"For that cohort of students, it's growth,\" Einhorn said.\nEinhorn said all student groups saw growth in English rates, though Black students had the smallest increase.\n\"We are reaching every student in some sense, in some capacity,\" Board President Emily Jackson said of the subgroups. \"Maybe not as well as we could, but we're getting there, we are making growth, and that's what I want to see.\"\nMATH TRENDSIn math, the district has many initiatives to increase proficiency. Einhorn said the number of elementary math coaches has increased from three to six, along with an addition of one middle school math coach.\nThe district is implementing an adaptive testing program called Measures of Academic Progress for kindergarten through eighth grade to track student growth.\nIn 2023-2024's state test scores, TCPS students showed increases across the board.\n\"We see slight increases for each one of our student groups,\" Einhorn said. \"We have less of an increase for our Hispanic and Latino students. And we still continue to have fewer than 5% of our Black students and our multilingual learners proficient in mathematics.\"\nFor proficiency levels below 5%, the state does not indicate exact percentages. Of the 24 districts, the Talbot district is one of three below the 5% mark in math proficiency among Black students, and one of nine districts below the 5% mark in math proficiency among multilingual students.\nEinhorn and Jackson each thanked the Talbot County Council for its commitment in funding education, particularly the math coaches in elementary schools.\n\"When you see movement like we did in third grade,\" Jackson said, \"I think that we are making really intentional, really important, really good funding decisions that have a big impact on learning.\"\nEXPERT REVIEWSAs required by the state's education initiative, Blueprint for Maryland's Future, experts vetted by the Maryland Department of Education will be reviewing school districts across the state. Einhorn said state reviewers will be visiting three elementary schools in Talbot County this year.\nThose schools will be Chapel District Elementary, St. Michaels Elementary and White Marsh Elementary. They were chosen for separate reasons. Einhorn stated: Chapel for reviewers to look at literacy instruction, St. Michaels to review practices for multilingual learners and White Marsh due to success in state testing.\n\"They had significant growth in their math achievement across all grades in this last MCAP assessment,\" Einhorn said of White Marsh Elementary. \"So they want to know what White Marsh is doing well.\"\nJackson asked how the district can take lessons learned from these three schools to its largest elementary school, Easton Elementary.\n\"Can you speak to how we plan to address that?\" Jackson asked. \"How do you take what you've learned at a very small, very specific population and duplicate it or replicate it at a school like Easton Elementary?\"\n\"One of the things that we do even though it's a larger school, we have committed the same types of resources but just on a larger scale,\" Einhorn said. \"So while our smaller elementaries might have one math coach, we see multiple math coaches to be able to service the number of classrooms that we have at Easton Elementary.\"\nEinhorn said other schools in the district will have state reviews in the next year or two. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In math, the district rose 1% to 12.3% proficiency, ranking 21st in the state.\nDuring the meetingThursday, Jodi Colman, the district's assistant superintendent of academics and student services, showed proficiency rates and rankings in the state broken down by grade level.\nColman said there were eight grade levels where the district's state ranking in math increased and six grade levels where the district's state ranking in English increased.\nIn fifth grade science, where 14.4% of students were considered proficient on the 2024 MCAP assessment, the ranking went up to 20th in the state for 2024 compared to 22nd the previous year.\nColman said that at a statewide assistant superintendent meeting recently, Dorchester County was mentioned for its growth in third grade math, sixth grade math and middle school algebra.\n\"I thought that was nice to be highlighted across the state as seeing a district that is actually moving some of their scores,\" she said after mentioning that math scores across the state were pretty stagnant in the 2024 MCAP compared to the previous year.\nColman also brought up concerns regarding district MCAP scores.\nAccording to the data Colman shared, 30.6% of 10th graders scored proficient on the English assessment last school year, ranking last in the state.\nColman said the district is looking at its support pathway classes, which it hopes will affect the 10th grade data \"more significantly.\"\nColman also brought up elementary English scores. She said that as students go up in grade, English proficiency levels decrease.\nColman said there have been discussions about whether the district should resume using its instructional program for elementary English or adopt a new one. The district's language arts supervisor is researching this.\nMoving forward, the district is getting feedback from the state on a new comprehensive literacy plan, Colman said.\n\"We are also looking at, across the board, our tier one instruction for any content level,\" she said. \"Making sure that we're really using that instructional planning model, that we're thinking through strategically with our students and that do we have good, formative assessment data to use in order to change teaching within our classrooms. And I think we have a lot of work to do in that area.\"\nColman said that although the MCAP scores aren't \"exactly where we want them,\" there is hope in the county about increasing the scores going forward.\n\"So I'm excited about that,\" she said.\nAfter Colman's presentation, Superintendent Jymil Thompson said although the score increases might not be \"monumental,\" they show progress.\n\"If we continue that progress over the years, it will add up,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said the purpose of the plan is to guide the work of the district from 2025 through 2028.\n\"This is kind of a long run for a strategic planning process,\" she said. \"So we want to be really inclusive. We want to be very engaging and come up with something that feels just a little bit scary but very doable for DCPS.\"\nCasson said the questions they want to answer in developing this plan include how to best prepare students, how to recruit and retain the best teachers and staff, how to provide students with opportunities to explore careers in local industries, and how to do best with the resources available.\nTo create the plan, Casson said September and October will be spent reviewing district data and understanding where the district is right now.\n\"This will include student surveys, parent surveys and staff surveys,\" she said.\nIn the coming months, through June, time will be spent researching and exploring what other districts are doing, prioritizing strengths and new initiatives, making plans and turning those plans into budgets, communicating district priorities to local partners, and starting to plan for next school year and beyond.\nCasson said Integrated Impact Group will give monthly updates to the board. She said they have set up an email account, planning@dcpsmd.org, that people can reach out to.\nThe district and Integrated Impact Group will be holding three community meetings for residents to share their ideas and priorities for the school years ahead. These meetings will be held Oct. 14 at Hurlock United Methodist Church, Oct. 15 at St. Luke Methodist Church and Oct. 16 at South Dorchester School.

It requires students to place their phones in locked pouches. The pouches stay with the students but remain locked until the end of the school day.\n\"Today's youth battle constant distraction caused by cell phone alerts and messaging that interrupt their ability to focus,\" Supt. Derek L. Simmons said in a recent notice to students and parents. He said this \"creates a negative impact on school culture and learning.\"\nElsewhere, administrators are getting creative about persuading students to go along with the plan.\nIn St. Mary's County, Supt. Scott Smith recently released a video describing the district's new plan to limit the distractions caused by cell phones.\nIn the video, he comically stops midway through his presentation of the new rules to take out his phone and text, showing students how difficult it can be to have a conversation when they are disengaged and on their phones.\n\"Hold on, just wait a second, I'm just going to text him real fast,\" Smith said in the video, pretending to send a message.\n\"That's really rude isn't it?\" he then pointed out. \"We're supposed to be having a conversation, and I'm interrupting myself and I'm getting on my phone and I'm texting.\"\n\"I'm not really here right?\" Smith said. \"I'm kind of distracted.\"\nSince the start of the school year, in St. Mary's County, they have confiscated around 30 cell phones per day, Smith told the school board in a recent meeting. That's out of 10,000 students, he said at the meeting.\n\"We have had many conversations about the joy of being in a classroom without the distraction of cell phones,\" Smith said, adding that he and his staff \"continue to work with our secondary students about the joy and some of the challenges of cellular devices and how we can maximize our joy and fun in life.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Incumbent Candace Henry and Ann O'Connor are squaring off for the District 2 seat. In District 5, incumbent Anna Howie and Karla Wieland-Cherry are running.\nThe District 6 seat, currently held by Mary Wheeler, is a race between Kerry Gunshenan and Cynthia Jurrius.\nHenry, O'Connor, Howie and Jurrius attended Wednesday's town hall, answering moderator and audience questions. Wieland-Cherry and Gunshenan did not attend.\nTEST SCORESScores released in August showed slight improvements in math and English proficiency rates in the district. The four candidates, though, were adamant that test scores must improve.\nIn English, 47.3% of Talbot County Public Schools students tested proficient, a jump of 2.8% from 44.5% in 2022-2023. In math, 18.3% of students were proficient, up 1.1% from 17.2% the year prior. The district slots in 14th and 18th, respectively, in those categories among the state's 24 districts.\n\"Our scores are not what we want,\" Henry said. She added that an increase in math coaches in the elementary schools and other forms of benchmark testing are current district initiatives.\n\"Standardized testing is a snapshot in a period of time,\" Henry said. \"(Superintendent Sharon) Pepukayi has worked with her team to really be intentional about gathering data from students on a more consistent basis.\"\nIn recent months, county residents have received flyers in the mail questioning the test scores, along with district spending and, most recently, a health education framework bill proposed at the state level.\n\"These flyers that came out are pretty alarming,\" O'Connor said. \"And I don't look at them as a negative on teachers. Teachers don't want these scores. The system is broken.\"\nO'Connor, who is backed by Talbot County's chapter of Moms for Liberty, a nationwide conservative political organization, said a lack of \"meaningful homework\" is a \"deficiency.\" She advocated for summer reading and said the district should look at what nearby private schools are doing in order to raise TCPS test scores.\nJurrius, who along with Henry and Howie is endorsed by the Talbot County Education Association labor union, addressed the most recent mailer sent to residents. That mailer stated, in part, that \"radical politicians are more worried about forcing harmful gender ideology\" on students, referencing a state Senate bill from 2023 that did not pass.\nJurrius stated she does not believe educators are indoctrinating students.\n\"This destructive polarization isn't helpful,\" Jurrius said. \"And whoever is behind it, (I) would love to see them contribute in a positive way. I think if we all work together, we can do some amazing things to increase our schools' test scores.\"\nSTUDENT ENGAGEMENTAcross the state, many districts are exploring ways to reduce cell phone use and other distractions in schools. TCPS has plans to roll out a pilot program for cell phone pouches sometime after Thanksgiving.\nHowie, an assistant principal at Federalsburg Elementary School in Caroline County, said Caroline County's current pilot of those same cell phone pouches has been a success.\n\"You can see engagement going through the roof,\" Howie said.\nShe emphasized that technology should be an addition to student learning and not the sole focus. \"A computer isn't a replacement, right. A computer should be a tool,\" she said.\nO'Connor said the same of computers. She said cell phones do not belong in schools and added she hopes to see an increased focus on books.\n\"Going back to the basics,\" O'Connor said. \"Are we reading books? Are books coming home? … I don't see them as much.\"\nJurrius advocated for \"restorative practices\" in student discipline to hold students accountable for actions. She said suspensions aren't always the solution.\n\"Students right now are different,\" Jurrius said. \"They have different challenges in their lives, their social media, their mental health issues.\"\nTEACHER RETENTIONCandidates discussed the need for effective recruitment and retention of teachers and staff amid shortages in the district, along with strategies to rectify those shortcomings.\nHowie emphasized the importance of retaining teachers and staff. She said looking at intent forms earlier will help the district and board understand why teachers leave.\n\"Being very intentional in having those conversations early … instead of getting that intent form at the end of the year and just start tallying up,\" Howie said.\nHenry added that the district should especially consider the feedback from teachers and staff that decide to stay. She hopes to see specific attention dedicated toward the district's \"Grow Your Own Teachers\" scholarship program.\n\"We should be growing teachers from our communities that can come back and teach in our communities,\" Henry said.\nResidents in Districts 2, 5 and 6 will see the respective school board candidates on the ballot on Election Day, which is Nov. 5. The three candidates elected will serve four-year terms. \n\n (c) Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

She volunteers with many local organizations. Wieland-Cherry said she grew up in a home that kept up with and often interacted with politics, both local and national. She is married and has two children.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI am running for the Talbot County Board of Education to work to improve our local school system for students, parents and our community.\nGoals I hope to achieve will be to improve test scores by enticing more qualified teachers to teach in Talbot County and retaining current teachers; raising education benchmark standards; increase use of CTE programs; improve student discipline rules; improve school safety measures; improve open communication transparency between schools, teachers, administration and parents and the community.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nAfter speaking with teachers in different grades at local schools, the constant concern I hear is the lack of student discipline and their safety as teachers. Teachers can't teach and students can't learn… and test scores can't improve… and teachers won't want to come teach in a county… if they are in an environment where everyone feels unsafe.\nTeachers have a distrust of the current board and feel that they don't listen to them and take their concerns seriously. I want to rebuild that trust by listening to teacher concerns and addressing those in a more supportive manner to make necessary changes.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nLack of teachers and staff seems to be the biggest issue. As I mentioned already in the prior questions, my priority will be to listen to teachers and rebuild the trust that is currently missing with the present board.\nI will also work to improve communication between schools, teachers, parents and the community and work to create a more secure learning environment for everyone.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nEveryone should take their own initiative to investigate local school data from reliable resources. These postcards are one way of bringing awareness to the community and open communication channels amongst parents, teachers, administration and the board to ask questions about their authenticity.\nIn speaking with many parents of all grade levels of students, I consistently hear that there is no open communication, especially with the current board.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nTeachers I've spoken with are frustrated and don't know Blueprint well, and what they do know is vague with no clear guidelines to how it's implemented. Funding Blueprint is based on inequities of and poverty levels of students for priority funding. Blueprint prioritizes equity learning.\nWe need to recognize every student's individuality and work to strengthen those individual skills for college/career readiness. We need to stop looking at certain groups as \"minorities\" and overlooking their skills as worthy individuals capable of learning instead of trying to make everyone \"equal\" to someone else. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was appointed to the post by Gov. Wes Moore in October, 2023.Howie is the assistant principal at Federalsburg Elementary School. She is married and has three children.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI am running for the District 5 seat of the Talbot County Board of Education to represent students, families and other stakeholders. We are making gains in our school district, and I want to continue to ensure that our students and teachers have access to high quality instructional materials that will have an impact on student achievement and success.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy priorities align with the goals set by the members of the Board of Education and the superintendent, Dr. (Shraron) Pepukayi. My two main areas of focus are increasing student achievement in the areas of mathematics and reading, and recruiting and retaining quality teachers.\nHaving teachers that provide outstanding instruction to our students will ensure that our students will be academically successful.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces, and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now is providing exceptional education opportunities for all students while being fiscally responsible.\nCurrently, the curriculum coordinating committee has brought high quality resources to the board for approval in the areas of reading and mathematics. These resources are paid for through educational grants. Utilizing grants is a responsible way of ensuring that we are providing our students with high quality instructional materials while being fiscally responsible.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nThe postcards that have been mailed out focused on student test scores as well as other concerns. In terms of student test scores, we have purchased new high quality instructional materials. Our 2024 data reflects growth in all subgroups as well as certain subject areas and grades.\nStudent test scores are not just a concern for our district but across the State. Through the Governance and Accountability pillar of the Blueprint, expert review teams will be visiting schools across the state to review literacy and mathematics instruction in our classrooms and provide quality feedback for improvement.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nI believe that the pillars of the Blueprint reflect the areas that all Maryland Schools want to address. Those pillars address early childhood education, high quality and diverse teachers, college and career readiness, more resources for students to be successful, and governance and accountability.\nThe Blueprint identifies and prioritizes the needs that we see in our district and across the state. In order for our students to be college and career ready by 10th grade, we need to start addressing their needs in pre-Kindergarten and ensure that they are receiving the resources they need to be successful in every grade. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She is married and has three sons, all of whom graduated from Talbot County Public Schools.She is running for the District 6 seat on the Board of Education.\nWhy are you running for office?\nOur public schools play a pivotal role in shaping our community's future, and we need board members who can help move (Talbot County Public Schools) forward to excellence. With a background in mediation and youth, school, family and community conflict resolution, I listen to all perspectives and value the richness in diversity of opinion.\nI am a collaborative problem solver, skilled at helping people work together to solve complex community challenges. I want to ensure that our board continues to function effectively, advancing schools where every student can thrive. We have many strengths on which to build; together, we can solve any challenge.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy priorities are interrelated: fostering academic excellence, supporting educators and creating a thriving school environment. I am committed to advancing student mastery of essential skills, improving academic proficiency and preparing students for college and careers.\nEnsuring we recruit, retain and support outstanding teachers is key to this vision. Equally important is providing a positive, safe, effective and inclusive school climate where all learners can succeed and promoting strong family and student engagement to build a collaborative, supportive community around our schools. Together, these priorities create the foundation for a bright future for our students.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nAdvancing academic proficiency is a priority. Supporting a positive, safe, effective and inclusive learning environment is fundamental for student success, as well as teacher retention. Finding innovative ways to engage families, including non-English speakers, and students will support all aspects of student success.\nThe current board and superintendent are making progress toward addressing these issues despite many challenges, such as the COVID-19 learning gap. Through additional instructional support, expanding use of innovative community partnerships, strategic use of technology, targeted allocation of resources and engaging all sectors of our community, we can accelerate progress in these areas.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nI would like to see the sender of the mailers come forward for productive and honest dialogue. While improving academic proficiency is essential, the harmful attacks on our teachers, fueled by misleading and inflammatory rhetoric, seem aimed at undermining our public schools and inciting fear.\nI would welcome an open, honest conversation about what this group seeks to accomplish, with accurate, relevant information. Let's work together to lift our Talbot County Public Schools to be the vibrant foundation of our community, where education is valued, everyone can belong and our teachers receive the support they need and deserve.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint for Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nThe creation of the Blueprint was the result of a comprehensive effort with input from many stakeholders. The five pillars are: Early Childhood Education; High Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders; College and Career Readiness; More Resources for Student Success; and Governance and Accountability.\nThe TCPS team has a detailed plan for managing the Blueprint and provides regular reports on progress for public view. There are many areas of the Blueprint that are positive, however, the most challenging aspects are mandates without sufficient funding. I support continued efforts to address the funding formula as it has been applied to Talbot County. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She is running for the District 2 seat on the Talbot County Board of Education.She is a former teacher and has six children.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI am running for the school board because I am deeply passionate about children's education. As a former teacher and mother of six, I have dedicated my career to helping children reach their highest potential.\nHaving witnessed my six children go through (Talbot County Public School), I have observed a decline in academic rigor, expectations and accountability, both in behavior and academics. This experience drives my desire to make meaningful changes on the school board. The fact that our students are scoring 18% proficient in math and 55% in reading indicates a pressing need for new perspectives on our educational strategies.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy priorities are the ABCs of education: advancing academics, boosting accountability and cultivating character. The focus is on the whole child. We cannot advance academics without discipline.\nWhen students develop self-discipline, good character naturally emerges. This requires daily practice and consistent reinforcement of rules and clear expectations for all students across all buildings. Disruptive behavior must be addressed promptly and effectively.\nRegarding academic accountability: A 95% graduation rate when less than ¼ of our students are proficient in math skills, and less than ½ are reading on grade level is inconsistent — something is broken here and we need to fix it.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most important issue is the steady decline of academic rigor. We need to make sure we continue to implement early intervention in elementary schools to support those who need that extra push. It's essential to send home books and ensure that our children have access to/and are accountable for reading materials throughout elementary, middle and high school.\nWe should place greater emphasis on traditional learning — using pencils and paper, cursive writing, fostering reading and critical thinking skills, while reducing reliance on computers. We need to offer pathways for middle school students interested in college or the workforce, including advanced/honors classes.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nThe postcards received in the mail are snapshots of where our schools stand. No one wants these scores, they are abysmal. It's a wake up call to attack the problem and change the way we have been doing education here in Talbot County.\nWe need to put our focus on reading, writing and math. Our students are distracted. Let's eliminate anything that detracts from our mission as educators and focus on what truly matters — educating the child. Let's get back to basics with my ABCs of education.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nSimply changing a name doesn't lead to improvement. Over the last two decades, this initiative has gone through four name changes. Although there are many wonderful proposals in the Blueprint, I don't believe that top-down programs created by education experts would make our local schools better.\nThe Blueprint is a blanket principle mandated for all 24 counties in Maryland. The counties have no say in how it is implemented. It removes the schools from the control of locally elected school boards and puts control in the hands of unelected officials. I believe we want control over our local schools. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

She lives in Easton with her family of four.Henry is the director of the Disability Resource Center at Salisbury University.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI am running for reelection to the Board of Education to ensure that every student, regardless of ability, background or language, has equal access to quality education. My focus on accessibility, equity and belonging stems from a commitment to create inclusive learning environments where all students feel valued and supported.\nI believe in breaking down barriers to success, advocating for diverse voices and fostering a sense of community in our schools. By addressing the unique needs of all learners, I aim to promote educational outcomes that empower every student to reach their full potential.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy priorities are consistent with TCPS' current philosophy of \"transforming and performing.\" I want the public to know that the Board of Education operates as a collective and is not driven by individual agendas.\nI am committed to the collective goals to prioritize narrowing and closing the opportunity and achievement gaps, eliminating barriers to education, recruiting and retaining high-quality educators, enhancing special education services, continuous improvement in reading and math proficiency, enhancing our summer school offerings, and early access to college preparatory, dual enrollment, and CTE programs.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most important issue facing (Talbot County Public Schools) is the opportunity gap, which directly affects reading and math proficiency for all students. To address this, the board must continue to prioritize equitable distribution of resources, ensuring that schools serving higher-need populations have access to targeted interventions.\nSimultaneously, recruiting and retaining high-quality educators is vital, as teachers are the foundation of student success. By investing in professional development and creating supportive environments for educators, we can close the opportunity gap and improve outcomes and opportunities for all students.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nThe postcards critical of Talbot County's education system are deeply troubling because they disparage the hard work of our educators. Much of the content includes outdated and inaccurate information, which undermines trust in our schools and the dedicated professionals working to support our students.\nThese types of messages are circulated with the intent to create division rather than foster productive dialogue. To address these concerns, we must continue to engage the community in open discussion, lead with facts — highlighting the progress being made and the work that still needs to be done, all while celebrating the efforts of our educators.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future presents significant benefits by prioritizing equity, early childhood education and career readiness, which can help close the opportunity gap and enhance student success. It also aims to improve educator salaries and professional development, which are crucial for recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers.\nMy concern is ensuring that the funding remains sustainable and that implementation is equitable, especially for rural areas like Talbot County. It's essential that all schools receive the resources needed to meet these ambitious goals, with careful oversight to ensure progress and accountability across the state. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She lives in Easton and has served as chairman of the Talbot County Public Schools Advisory Council representing St. Michaels Elementary School and St. Michales Middle and Hight School. She has also served as president of the Advisory Board for St. Michaels YMCA.She has been married for 22 years and has five children ranging from 14 to 20 years old. She is running for the District 6 seat on the Board of Education.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI'm running for office because I have seen a decline in education since my oldest child started in (Talbot County Public Schools). I believe all our children deserve better. No one is going to care more or be more passionate about solving issues that face our schools today than a mother with four children in the system. I care deeply about our schools, I pay attention, and I love our community. I'm a mom who wants to prioritize education and improve outcomes.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy top priority is to ensure all students are college or career ready by the time they graduate. I want to see all students obtain critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, it's important for students to have personal responsibility, financial literacy, strong communication, and respect for themselves and others. With the combination of these skills, our children will have a bright future.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nCandidate choose not to answer.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nThe recent postcards have highlighted the decline in student performance on standardized tests. I believe this is not about placing blame but about transparency.\nIt brings the issue to the attention of Talbot County residents, which positions us better to solve the problem. Once we realize where we are today, we can determine where we want to go and how to get there. If everyone can unite around a common goal of increasing test scores in reading and math, we can more quickly work together to solve this issue.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's future mandates so many requirements that it's difficult for our local school system to continue programs they feel are successful. Having the authority to make decisions at the local level will allow citizens of Talbot County to address the needs of our community schools more effectively. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Upon entering the school, students will place their phones in the pouches and use a Yondr magnet to lock the pouch. During dismissal, students will use the same magnetic device to unlock the pouches and retrieve their phones.\nEinhorn said the district has talked to Yondr representatives about ensuring there are enough magnets in case of an emergency.\n\"They've been able to share with us some best practices, which include how many magnets you would need per student in the building to be able to effectively and efficiently get students out at the end of the day,\" Einhorn said.\nLike Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said prior to his district's rollout, Einhorn emphasized that cell phones can be a distraction during emergencies.\n\"We've had conversations and heard from national experts that during a real school emergency, it is actually greater safety risk for 800 students to be pulling out their phones and making phone calls instead of listening to the directions that will help keep them safe,\" she told board members.\nDebbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools, said each pouch costs about $27. In all, 975 pouches were purchased for a total just below $27,000, \"paid for from the local FY24 materials of instruction budget,\" Gardner said.\nBoard Vice President Candace Henry asked how long it will take students to put their phones in pouches and retrieve them at the beginning and end of each day. Einhorn and Pepukayi said they expect it will take some time at first but that the process should become simple and streamlined over time.\nEaston Middle families will receive more details from the district about the pouch program later this week, and a presentation will be given to students on Friday.\nBoard Member Deborah Bridges inquired if the pilot program may extend to other schools in the district this year if it is deemed successful.\n\"I do think we will need to see at least this year what our data is telling us about the impact,\" Einhorn said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-10-18",

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed approves funding for capital projects, discusses turf field status\n\n October 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 700\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Following a lengthy discussion last month on the conditions of athletic fields in the district, the Talbot Board of Education moved forward Wednesday in deciding how to allocate available funds toward capital projects, including field improvements.Talbot County Public Schools has $1.5 million in fiscal year 2025 funding from the county meant to put toward capital projects, leaving the decision up to board members on which projects receive that money.\nIn past meetings, a list of potential projects — which total to $3.36 million — was set to vie for that $1.5 million. Those included Easton High School stadium lights, an Easton Elementary basketball court, a St. Michaels Elementary playground replacement, Easton High auditorium light replacements and an artificial turf field at the high school.\nChief Financial Officer Sarah Jones told the board that the first three projects have been funded with grants. On Wednesday, Jones presented a modified list of potential capital projects. The auditorium lights and artificial turf field remained on that list.\nThree projects were new to that list on Wednesday: HVAC unit replacements at Easton High for $1,100,000, LED lights at St. Michaels Middle High School for $566,000, and field improvements across the district for $200,000, the latter of which stemmed from concerns raised at a Sept. 18 board meeting about the safety and upkeep of high school fields in the county.\nBoard President Emily Jackson expressed concern that new projects would continue to usurp side projects, such as the artificial turf field, which is projected to cost around $1.8 million alone.\n\"Something's always going to take priority, which is why I'm saying (pull from our) fund balance, because that's what it's for, it's for those side projects that are never going to take priority,\" Jackson said.\nJackson and other board members recognized that the HVAC improvements and LED lights are necessary. Director of Operations Kevin Shafer said the district proposed HVAC improvements in a capital improvement plan to the state, and that the aging units can make it a couple more years before state funding may come through.\nShafer and Jones added that funds for field improvements could be sought through maintenance budget requests or adjustments. Shafer emphasized in order to increase field quality, his team needs better equipment \"to do better maintenance.\"\nThe board unanimously approved a motion from Jackson to approve $817,321 for Easton High auditorium lights, $566,000 for LED lights at St. Michaels and the remaining $117,000 for athletic field projects in general. The projects will not begin until capital-enabling legislation is approved by the Talbot County Council.\nARTIFICIAL TURF FIELDMuch of Wednesday's back-and-forth between Shafer, Jones and the board centered on the potential of funding an artificial turf field at Easton High. It's a project that has received much community support, including from field hockey players and families.\nSome board members suggested the board consider using extra funds the district has to save toward the $1.8 million projected price tag.\n\"I think we should begin to lay down our concrete plan if that's the way we're going to go, of how we're going to fund it in the future and what that's going to look like,\" Board Vice President Candace Henry said.\nShafer said that if a new turf field is agreed upon, he believes it should be placed at the current stadium field. Jackson disagreed, citing previous presentations to the board regarding football injury risks on artificial turf.\n\"We could look at maybe fencing off a different field to make it a more appropriate and safe field for our athletes to be on,\" Jackson said.\n\"I would urge the board to consider whether that would be the most equitable use of funds,\" Shafer responded, \"… to just have a turf field for one sport, if it's going to be field hockey or whatever. I question whether that is a good investment in moving forward.\"\nNo official motions regarding funding for the turf project were made Wednesday, though Jackson keyed in on pushing the discussion forward.\n\"Safety for all of our athletes has to be the No. 1 priority,\" she said. \"Number two, very closely following that, is opportunity for our athletes, and I want to make sure that we are giving the most amount of opportunity to the most amount of kids.\" \n\n © Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester ends alternative education contract in middle, elementary schools\n\n October 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 448\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Cambridge — Four months since the Dorchester County Board of Education voted to terminate its more than three-year contract with an alternative education program for high schoolers, the board has decided to terminate its one-year contract with an alternative education program for elementary and middle school students.At a Board of Education meeting Thursday, the board unanimously voted to terminate its contract with Transforming Lives for convenience. The service provided alternative education for up to 48 Dorchester County Public Schools elementary and middle school students at one time.\nBoard members did not comment on the decision to terminate the contract at the meeting.\nReview of the contract was not originally on Thursday's meeting agenda. The board voted to add it to the agenda after board member Chris Wheedleton made a motion to do so. Later in the meeting, Wheedleton made a motion to terminate the contract for convenience, which the board unanimously voted in favor of.\nWheedleton did not immediately respond for comment on the decision.\nAccording to the contract, either party can terminate it for any or no reason with 60-days advance written notice.\nThe program, called Positive Change Academy-Dorchester, began this past summer and was set to end June 30, 2025. It is housed at The Judy Center at Sandy Hill Elementary School and at the New Directions Learning Academy. It cost the district $79,000 per month.\nThe board approved the contract at a special Board of Education meeting in July. At that meeting, district Superintendent Jymil Thompson said the district looked at this program as one stop in a student's education journey. He said it would be a place where students could remedy behavior and improve academics before going back into a \"regular educational setting.\"\nThe district did not immediately respond for comment on the board's decision.\nThis is not the first time the board has terminated an alternative education contract in the past year.\nIn June, the Board of Education voted to terminate its more than three-year contract with Vision Quest, an alternative education program for district high schoolers that had been met with criticism from residents since the contract was approved in September 2023. The district had been paying Vision Quest $93,363 per month for services, which would have added up to over $3.3 million over three years.\nThe decision to terminate the Vision Quest contract was one of the reasons former Dorchester County Board of Education Vice President Susan Morgan resigned in June. She was the sole vote in favor of keeping the contract. In an interview with the Star Democrat in June, Morgan said the district needed an alternative program for the fall that would benefit the students as much as she witnessed first-hand with the success of Vision Quest. \n\n Copyright 2024",

    "content": "Maryland school board candidates push for officers, mental health services\n\n October 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Emily R. Condon and Max Schaeffer Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1315\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In Montgomery County, school board candidate Brenda M. Diaz worries that \"knife-wielding vandals\" have easy access to schools because the district removed the police officers that are on hand in the rest of Maryland's public school districts to try to keep the peace.Across the state on the Eastern Shore, school board candidate Karla Wieland-Cherry of Talbot County told the Local News Network in a candidate survey that teachers feel threatened by some of their students.\nAnd in Howard County, school board candidate Andrea Chamblee — whose husband, John McNamara, was shot to death in the 2018 mass shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis — said the threat of a school shooting is just one of the stressors looming over the county's children.\n\"Bullying, mental health struggles, technology addiction, unreliable transportation, larger class sizes, fewer fine art enrichment opportunities, portable classrooms, overcrowding, poorly maintained buildings, food insecurity, poor indoor air quality and bigotry are all eroding the well-being of our students and staff,\" Chamblee said. \"Students who aren't well, can't learn well. In order to focus on academics, we must take on these safety challenges and provide students and staff with a stable learning environment.\"\nConcern about school safety in Maryland spans the state — which is why candidates in Maryland's school district races are stressing the issue. Of the 74 candidates who replied to a Local News Network questionnaire, 48 said they were not entirely satisfied with school safety in their district. Many called for adding more law enforcement officers as well as mental health counselors to their local schools.\nDiaz advocates returning school resource officers to Montgomery County schools — but statistics, and the comments of school board candidates statewide, make clear that school safety and student behavior aren't easily controlled just by in-school cops.\nSchool safety at a glanceThe school safety problem is a national one. Violent incidents increased 49% in the nation's schools the 2023-2024 school year, according to the Educator's School Safety Network.\nMaryland has not yet released its 2023-2024 statistics, but in the 2022-2023 school year, the number of anonymously reported bullying or cyberbullying incidents rose over the prior year from 91 to 107 , according to the Maryland Center for School Safety. The number of assaults and threats to cause harm increased from 83 to 98. And the number of general school safety complaints shot up from 62 to 104.\nThe school safety center also tracks critical life threatening incidents, which are defined as incidents that cause death or serious injury, or acts of mass violence under law. These incidents for the past three school years totaled 17, 18 and 18.\nAmong those incidents are the following:\nOn Oct. 27, 2023, at a Baltimore City high school, a student worked in tandem with both of his parents to assault and shoot three other students.In April 2024, Montgomery County Police arrested a high school senior who had written a 129-page manifesto on his plans for a school shooting.In January 2024, a high school student was arrested after threatening mass violence and arson at the school, the Somerset County Sheriff's Office said. The student had previously been caught with a gun at school, according to a county press release.\nSchool board candidate Matthew Warren Lankford, whose son was in the school at the time of that last incident, said that student is now back in school. \"This student needs special attention and should never be allowed back in the school as a normal student again,\" Lankford said.\nSchool resource officers\nSchool resource officers, the official name for trained officers in schools under Maryland's 2019 Safe to Learn Act, are posted in some schools in every Maryland jurisdiction except Montgomery County. And many school board candidates expressed support for hiring more school resource officers.\n\"I am satisfied with the safety for the big, catastrophic-type events,\" said Jaime Brennan, a Frederick County school board candidate. \"But I am not satisfied with the daily acts of violence…that occur. I think that expanding the school resource officer program so that we have a designated SRO in each middle and high school would help.\"\nThe Maryland Center for School Safety is responsible for training school resource officers in the state and reports each year on their coverage in schools. The overall number of schools with a full-time officer on hand increased from 273 in 2021-2022 to 288 in the 2022-2023 school year.\nIn Calvert County, another candidate who is running for reelection, Antoine White, said he meets regularly with his board's safety liaison and local sheriff's department. White voted to increase the number of school resource officers in his district.\nBut another candidate in Calvert County, Paul Harrison, said he is not content with the lack of armed officers in six schools and pledged to try to fill those gaps.\nIn contrast, Montgomery County ended its school resource officer program in 2021 amid concerns that students of color were being disproportionately disciplined. The district now has a community engagement officer program, in which officers patrol near schools and enter schools as needed.\nA PTA president running for the school board in the county, Rita Montoya, said the officers allowed in schools must be properly vetted.\n\"Providing opportunities for healthy and positive engagement between students and officers is another necessary step,\" Montoya said.\nMore school districts opt for a constant, visible law enforcement presence. Worcester County Board of Education member Jon M. Andes touted his district as the first in the state to have school resource officers.\n\"We need to continue work with our law enforcement partners, enhance our summer safe schools retreat, and strengthen our proactive approach to preventing problems,\" said Andes, who is running for reelection.\nConversely, Gerry LaFemina worries about the use of officers in schools in Allegany County, where he is running for the school board.\n\"I loathe the idea of making our schools seem like they're under attack because that provides an atmosphere ripe for distraction,\" he said. \"I also worry about the use of police in the schools, which can often lead to escalation of problems rather than mediated solutions.\"\nOther than LaFemina, none of the 74 candidates who replied to a Local News Network survey questioned or opposed assigning police officers to schools.\nMore counselors?Many candidates made clear, though, that school resource officers can't solve the school safety problem alone. Twenty-five candidates mentioned increased mental health or counseling intervention as an important step in their survey response.\n\"Schools should prioritize not only physical safety but also students' social and emotional well-being,\" said Tiffini Andorful, a Prince George's County school board candidate. \"This could include increasing the number of support staff and providing access to resources and training to effectively handle conflicts. I also think there should be a greater emphasis on emergency preparedness and increased advocacy for gun control at higher levels.\"\nMany also emphasized the importance of building a healthy school atmosphere beginning when students are young.\n\"We really need to focus on social-emotional learning and fostering a culture of acceptance of others from the youngest grades and up,\" said Erica McFarland, an Anne Arundel County candidate.\nMcFarland said she feels that this type of focus can help to prevent bullying, a common reason for students to feel unsafe at school.\nMeg Ricks, a candidate in Howard County, said increased counseling services would likely stem other problems, too.\n\"We must start while students are young to give them tools for dealing with conflict and seeking help when needed,\" she said in her survey response. \"I would like to see more counselors in our schools so that we can provide students with productive solutions to the challenges they are facing.\"\nAt the same time, 13 candidates statewide said that the secret to solving the school safety puzzle lies not just in school resource officers and mental health services, but in old-fashioned school discipline.\n\"We need to re-address school discipline measures and take improved steps to reduce the threats and in some cases, violence,\" Wieland-Cherry of Talbot County said. \"Teaching and learning cannot take place in an environment (where) one feels unsafe.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Is Maryland’s ‘Blueprint’ the path to better schools?\n\n October 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Marwa Barakat and Colin McNamara Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1365\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A 10-year, $30 billion plan out of Annapolis, the Blueprint for Maryland's Future aims to dramatically improve the state's public schools by boosting teacher salaries, expanding pre-kindergarten and rewriting the curriculum — and school board candidates say the state's schools need that improvement.\"The Blueprint is Maryland's surest path to creating beyond great schools,\" said Phelton Moss, a school board candidate from Prince George's County.\nBut to hear other Maryland school board candidates tell it, the Blueprint is a budget-buster.\n\"The Blueprint sounds great on paper; however, funding it is a great challenge for every county in Maryland,\" St. Mary's County school board candidate Elena Brewer said.\nThat debate echoes across Maryland as voters in 20 of the state's 24 school districts prepare to go to the polls. The Local News Network at the University of Maryland sent a questionnaire to all 109 candidates, asking them, among other things, to name the state's top education issue.\nForty-two of the candidates who responded to the questionnaire expressed concerns about the costs and the mandates stemming from the Blueprint. In a school board election where there are no races in Baltimore City or County, a Prince George's County candidate, Zakyia Goins-McCants, summed up the views of a number of candidates from suburban and rural districts.\n\"The Blueprint for Maryland's Future is transformative legislation that reflects our state's commitment to equitable education,\" she said. \"However, it was passed without a full funding plan, and the financial implications are significant.\"\n'A transformational investment'Passed by the General Assembly in 2021 over the veto of then-Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, the Blueprint is built on five pillars. Under the Blueprint, school districts are mandated to:\nCombat the teacher shortage by increasing the minimum teacher salary to $60,000 by July 2026 and build new \"career ladders\" for educators.Expand pre-kindergarten so that it's available free to low- and moderate-income families and available to all.Adjust the curriculum to ensure students are college- and career-ready by the end of 10th grade.Implement a \"ninth-grade tracker\" system to assess how the Blueprint is working for each student as part of a statewide accountability plan.Boost funding to match the state's lofty new goals.\nHearing all of that, many of the state's school board candidates said the Blueprint is a great but complex and pricey plan.\nTierney Davis, a board candidate from Cecil County, called the Blueprint \"a transformational idea\" but noted there are serious issues in implementing the plan. Veronica Lowe from Frederick County called it \"a transformative investment in our education system\" but expressed concerns about funding the effort.\nMichael Shisler from Calvert County said the plan is a chance to \"improve our common good.\"\n\"If we continue to see education as a cost, rather than as an investment, then folks will just wait for this latest reform to fade away,\" Shisler said. \"The Blueprint is an opportunity to level the playing field for all kids in Maryland.\"\nSeveral candidates said that the playing field needs leveling.\n\"The most important issue facing Anne Arundel County Public Schools is the existence of persistent gaps in opportunity and achievement between different subgroups of students,\" said Joanna Bache Tobin of Anne Arundel County.\nMeanwhile, Julie Kaplan of Howard County said schools must improve to make sure every student leaves school prepared for college or a career.\n\"We must address the learning gaps created by the COVID-19 pandemic,\" she said.\nA number of candidates cited stagnant or declining test scores in their school districts and beyond.\n\"Statewide, our student proficiency rates in math and English are suffering,\" said Laura McKenzie of Kent County.\nBut schools will improve if the Blueprint is implemented properly, its supporters said.\n\"The Blueprint offers us an opportunity to invest in our schools and ensure an excellent education for every student,\" said Meg Ricks, a candidate for the school board in Howard County.\n'Unfunded'Support for the Blueprint was by no means uniform among the state's school board candidates, however. Many echoed the thoughts of Andre Gao, another Howard County school board candidate.\n\"The Blueprint for Maryland's Future sounds promising on paper with its goals, but the funding presents a significant problem,\" Gao said. \"Without adequate financial support, implementing the Blueprint will be challenging.\"\nThe Blueprint lacks financial support at both the state and the district level.\nThe General Assembly approved the Blueprint without determining how it would be paid for, and as a result, the state is projected to run long-term deficits that largely track its increased education costs. A state Department of Legislative Services fiscal briefing released in January said that the deficit will appear in fiscal 2025 and hit nearly $2.93 billion in fiscal 2029 — a year when the Blueprint is set to cost the state $4 billion.\nRachel Hise, the executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board, said she is hopeful the Maryland General Assembly will fully fund the Blueprint and is willing to make changes if necessary.\nWhen asked whether state taxes will be raised to support the Blueprint, Hise said, \"That is a decision for the governor and General Assembly.\"\nAgainst that backdrop, Gov. Wes Moore — a longtime proponent of the Blueprint — has acknowledged that the plan may have to be altered.\n\"While I believe in making sure that we have a world-class education system, we've got to be able to work together to create an actual plan to be able to implement it because right now there are real challenges in being able to get that done and get it done in a way that the locals, and the state and every other partner who's involved sees that taking place,\" Moore told Fox45 News in Baltimore in July. \"So, there have to be adjustments.\"\nMeanwhile, school district candidates said the Blueprint is already putting pressure on local school budgets, given that school costs in Maryland are shared by the state and its 24 districts.\n\"While the Blueprint was touted as significantly increasing education funding, the reality is that the funding is not distributed equitably, and rural counties have been left out, by and large,\" said Cathy Allen, a school board candidate in St. Mary's County. \"We did not receive increased funding from the state to cover mandates within the Blueprint.\"\n'So many requirements'School board candidates said they worry not only about the Blueprint's costs, but also about the expensive edicts the plan imposes on local school districts. In some cases, they said, those mandates are already leading to unintended consequences.\nJon M. Andes, a candidate in Worcester County, said he fully supports the Blueprint's five pillars.\n\"However, without additional state funding, we will not be able to implement the Blueprint plan without making significant budget cuts to reallocate funds,\" Andes said. \"As an example, to reach the $60,000 minimum (teacher) salary, we will need to significantly increase class size and reduce materials of instruction.\"\nSuch things are already happening in Howard County, Gao said.\n\"In our school district, we have not received sufficient funding from the state and county to fully implement the Blueprint,\" he said. \"This has contributed to budget shortfalls, leading to staff cuts, program reductions and increased class sizes. Many teachers have already expressed concerns about the negative impact of staff shortages and increased class sizes.\"\nSuch issues stem from the fact that the Blueprint mandates that funding be redirected in a number of ways. For one thing, by mandating higher teacher salaries and a host of other changes, some school districts may be forced to cut other popular programs.\n\"The Blueprint for Maryland's Future mandates so many requirements that it's difficult for our local school system to continue programs it feels are successful,\" said Kerry Gunshenan, a school board candidate in Talbot County.\nIn addition, the Blueprint mandates that districts direct more funding to schools with larger numbers of high-need students, such as those that are performing poorly or where students are learning to speak English.\nMike Lukas, a board member who is running for re-election in Charles County, praised that change.\n\"Your ZIP code or household income should not define the quality of your education,\" he said.\nTom Woods, who is running for re-election to the board in Garrett County, neatly summed up the thoughts of many of the school board members across the state.\n\"The ideas and solutions presented by the Blueprint come with an awful lot of obstacles,\" Woods said.\nLocal News Network director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Candidates backed by the PAC won control of the school boards in Somerset and Calvert counties, while appearing poised to win in Talbot County. Final results await the counting of some mail-in and provisional ballots, which must be counted by Nov. 15.\nCampaign finance records show that the Maryland State Education Association Fund for Children and Public Education — the political arm of the state's teachers union — spent $516,999.57 during the 2024 election cycle. And the 1776 Project PAC clearly sees the teachers' union as its defeated rival in the election.\n\"Even outspending us by $450,000, the teachers' union couldn't beat us in deep-blue Maryland—their message is just too extreme,\" said Stefano Forte, executive director of the 1776 Project PAC. \"Voters chose raising test scores and graduation rates over their far-left culture war. On Tuesday, common sense won, and that has no price tag.\"\nA fourth school district with candidates targeted for defeat by Democrats — Washington County — also flipped to conservative control without the aid of the 1776 Project PAC.\nOf those 11 winners endorsed by that conservative PAC, six had also been targeted for defeat by the Maryland Democratic Party, which selected 24 \"extreme\" conservative school board candidates in the state to directly invest against — a move the party referred to as \"unprecedented.\" Of those 24, only nine have been lost thus far. The remaining 15 all won or are leading their respective races.\n\"We are proud that we pushed out some of the most extreme elements in these races,\" said Luca Amayo, spokesperson for the Maryland Democratic Party. \"It's clear, however, that we must continue to bolster our grassroots efforts and make Marylanders aware of the far-right agenda encroaching into Maryland's public schools, especially as they are emboldened under a Donald Trump presidency.\"\nThe party considers the 1776 Project PAC a \"radical ring-wing group,\" and helped defeat five of its endorsed candidates from winning office. Ryan James Girdusky, the committee's founder, wrote on the PAC's website that he created the organization \"to change public education by reforming school boards and electing reform-minded conservatives who wanted to improve public education in this country.\"\nAs of Oct. 16, the PAC had pumped $90,580.50 toward the campaigns of 13 candidates across Cecil, Queen Anne's, Talbot, Calvert, Somerset and St. Mary's counties.\nIn Calvert County, candidates endorsed by the 1776 Project PAC won all three school board seats.\nRetired principal Mike Shisler lost his bid for the board. He said he fears that the new conservative leadership, all of whom were targeted by the state's Democratic Party as well, would create inequity and fear within the county's education system.\n\"I'm very disappointed in the results,\" Shisler said Wednesday, \"It's not going to be inclusive of everybody. It's going to target folks. It's going to try to undo the work of previous boards of education when it came to stressing equity and diversity, and I think they're trying to roll back the clock.\"\nJoseph Marchio, who defeated Shisler, said he expected a close race going into Tuesday night. His margin was the closest of the three 1776 Project PAC-backed victors in Calvert County.\nIn Washington County, on the state's panhandle, all four candidates that Democrats targeted for defeat won their election, flipping the county's school board into conservative control. All three non-targeted incumbents lost reelection, while April Ann Zentmeyer, the only targeted incumbent, defended hers.\n\"I look forward to working with new board members and faithful colleagues to maximize opportunities for students, faculty, staff, and parents; and to identify solutions that will strengthen WCPS,\" Zentmeyer said in a statement.\nWashington County has a county-wide school board election process, as opposed to the school districts where candidates are elected by district. Instead of one-on-one races, all school board candidates in Washington County face each other in a crowded pool, with the top four vote-getting candidates winning seats. Carroll, Allegany and Frederick counties have similar systems.\nThe success of conservative school board candidates around Maryland reflects a larger trend from this year's election cycle: the state's rightward shift. According to data from the Associated Press, every county in Maryland shifted rightward this year compared to the 2020 election — from two points in Charles County and Baltimore City to eight points in Cecil County.\nSome races remain too close to call. In Frederick County, two conservative candidates targeted by Democrats led the race for three seats as of Friday, but two other candidates trailed close behind. Talbot County, which flipped conservative this cycle, saw two 1776 Project PAC-endorsed candidates win seats, while a third trailed by a narrow margin as of Friday with votes still left to tally.\nSomerset County, the third district flipped by 1776 Project PAC-endorsed contenders, saw massive margins of victory for the conservatives, with Mary Beth Bozman securing about four-fifths of the vote in her race. Her opponent was Alverne \"Chet\" Chesterfield — who, the Local News Network reported last month, had a peace order initiated against him in 2022.\nThe Local News Network also reported that Brandie Edelen, a 1776 Project PAC-endorsed candidate in St. Mary's County, had a state tax lien filed against her in 2019. Edelen handily lost her race to Josh Guy.\nIn deep-blue Howard County, Andrea Chamblee is in a tight race with Trent Kittleman, an early supporter of the county's Moms for Liberty chapter. Even though Democrat Kamala Harris carried over two-thirds of the votes cast in the presidential race in the county, Chamblee led Kittleman by only 3.5 points as of Friday morning.\nMail-in and provisional ballots, which have leaned in favor of Chamblee this far, are still being counted.\nThe founder of Moms for Liberty in Frederick County, Jaime Brennan, appeared headed to victory. She said that despite the Maryland Democrats' campaign against her and Colt Black, the other conservative in the race, that effort didn't appear to be all that effective.\n\"They spent a lot of money in opposition to me and Colt, and to prop up the other side, but I didn't hear from a single person who said, 'Oh, I heard about this and I'm not voting for you,'\" Brennan said.\nIn neighboring Carroll County, where Moms For Liberty lobbied for the removal of 60 books from school libraries — 21 permanently — conservative candidates secured their hold on the board. Greg Malveaux and Kristen Zihmer defeated Amanda Jozkowski and Muri Lynn Dueppen, who together ran an underdog progressive campaign called the Slate for Student Success, which was endorsed by the Carroll County Educators Association.\n\"It's really a shame that a lot of voters in our county chose to kind of take their marching orders from their political party, rather than considering the opinions of the educators,\" Jozkowski said. She previously ran and lost in 2022.\nJozkowski said the race was a reflection of the national results, which saw an overwhelming rightward shift in nearly every state and in many down-ballot races. Malveaux and Zihmer were both targeted by the Maryland Democrats.\nThat rightward shift could also be seen in the school board race in Anne Arundel County's District 3. There, the conservative candidate, Chuck Yocum, fell only 2.76 points behind his opponent, Erica McFarland, despite weeks of controversy over Yocum's 1994 acquittal on child sexual abuse and perverted practices charges.\nLocal News Network reporters Sasha Allen, Marwa Barakat, Ela Jalil, Colin McNamara and Tolu Talabi contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Districts 2, 5 and 6 were on the ballot in the November election.\nFor district 2, O'Connor won with 52.7% of the vote, according to the State Board of Elections, beating out incumbent Board Member Candace Henry. O'Connor said her campaign provided the opportunity for her to get a better understanding of leading a campaign, school board responsibilities and Blueprint, Maryland's 10-year plan to improve the state's education system.\nO'Connor said she has just skimmed the surface and is ready to learn more.\nShe said she will be prioritizing academics and discipline. With academics, she said she would like to see elementary students reading every night and working on more book reports, and for schools to provide summer reading lists.\nFor discipline, O'Connor said she has noticed a lack of consistency, or \"different rules for different people.\"\n\"We need a plan for all the schools that this is the way we're going to, you know, this is the dress, this is the behavior when you walk in the building. If you veer from that, there's going to be this consequence, and you got to, I mean, it's the follow through,\" she said.\nFor District 5, Karla Wieland-Cherry won with 54.6% votes, according to the State Board of Elections. Wieland-Cherry, who defeated incumbent Board Member Anna Howie, said she appreciated the support she received from her campaign, though she did mention she \"got a lot of negativity.\" She hopes she can work through any negative sentiments to have a productive four years on the board.\nWieland-Cherry said she will be prioritizing open communication for everyone she works with and promoting the Career and Technology Education Program, which offers job training in various fields.\nShe said it's important to encourage kids to look at career alternatives for those not interested in college, whether that be training to become a firefighter, plumber or welder.\n\"I think (the CTE program is) under encouraged, under utilized,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"And that's where jobs are.\"\nFor District 6, Jurrius won with 51.9% of the vote, defeating Kerry Gunshenan, according to the State Board of Elections. Current District 6 Board Member Mary Wheeler did not seek reelection.\nJurrius did not answer calls from reporters in time for publication. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Three new members will be sworn in next month.\n\"Your guidance and direction as board members has strengthened the bond between our community and our schools,\" Pepukayi said.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said the three outgoing members were crucial to the Board of Education's work to improve education in the county.\n\"That (work) is quietly often led by these three, which maybe you aren't aware of in the community. But I'm telling you tonight,\" Jackson said. \"We are going to be cut down at the knees. We will grow back.

If I didn't, I know I tried,\" Wheeler said. \" … Cynthia, the person who's taking my place, is here tonight. I so enjoy your enthusiasm.

The outgoing vice president is the director of Salisbury University's Disability Resource Center.\nJackson said she's \"so proud of the work\" she accomplished alongside Henry, who has often spearheaded special education and accessibility efforts carried out by the board.\n\"As I step away from this role, I encourage you all to stay focused on what truly matters — every student, and I mean every student,\" Henry said. \"Don't let individual agendas divide you or distract you from the essential work of seeing that every student is seen as valuable and worthy of our full support.\"\n\"I wish better for our community,\" she continued, \"but now I get to just hold people accountable from another seat, and that's exactly what I plan to do.\" \n\n Copyright  2024",

Although board members did not comment on the decision to terminate the contract at the meeting, board member Chris Wheedleton said in an email that the actions the board took were in support of Thompson's recommendations to \"equip\" educators with the best resources to \"get the best possible outcomes for our kids and our community.\"\n\"The board is working to encourage and support Dr. Thompson's plans to continuously review and refine the best approaches possible to create the best conditions for each of our students to thrive academically,\" Wheedleton said in the email.\nFour months earlier, the board voted to terminate its more than three-year contract with an alternative education program for high schoolers that would have cost the district over $3.3 million. The program had been met with criticism from residents since the contract for it was approved in September 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said families are moving out of the district because they're concerned about sending their kids to Sandy Hill.\n\"Our school is old and falling apart,\" she said.\nMcGowan brought up plumbing issues in bathrooms, issues with the building's room temperatures and the difficulties of having to teach and learn in open concept classrooms. Other teachers brought up mold problems and critters and bugs getting into the building.\n\"There's organic growth in the building,\" Sandy Hill teacher Christy Starling said. \"Just two years ago, we had to push back our availability to enter the building prior to school starting due to massive mold infestation that had to be treated within a month before school started.\"\nAs part of the consent agenda passed during the meeting, the board voted in favor of having architecture firm Hord Coplan Macht do an ed specifications and feasibility study for the district's oldest elementary schools, including Sandy Hill.\nThe ed specifications and feasibility study is being funded by Maryland's Interagency Commission on School Construction. The IAC is also allocating money for school capital improvement projects in the county once the study has been completed.\nDuring a Board of Education work session in October, board members heard from the IAC on the different programs it operates and its projected budget allocations to Dorchester County.\nFor fiscal year 2026, the IAC estimates $2.75 million of its Capital Improvement Program will be allocated to Dorchester County, with a state cost share of 98%. The IAC'S Built To Learn Program, a temporary program created to hand out project-specific grants across the state, has $3.9 million budgeted for Dorchester County. Those funds need to be spent by 2031.\nAt the meeting Thursday, Assistant Superintendent of Administrative Services Michael Collins said it is important that the district moves forward with the ed specifications and feasibility study quickly because the IAC funding for it needs to be encumbered by the end of the year.\n\"We want to get this phase done so we can make big decisions on our old elementary schools,\" he said.\nCollins said the ed speculations process will take six months. He said a committee will work with the community to get an idea of what the ideal Dorchester County elementary school looks like. The feasibility study, he said, will determine what makes the most sense for each of the schools included.\n\"The feasibility study basically looks at each school and says, is it feasible to either renovate this school, replace this school or combine this school in order to make it fit with the ed spec?\" Collins said.\nOnce this process is complete, the district will be able to bid out capital improvement projects. Collins estimated it will take about a year to complete the studies.\nAt the end of the meeting, board member Talibah Chikwendu told the Sandy Hill teachers that she is sorry it will \"take so long\" to build a school.\n\"Because even though the things are in place for us to actually get a large amount of that money to get it done, the process takes a very long time,\" she said. \"I am sorry that you will have to continue to work in those conditions while we do so.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline Commissioners hear update on potential for new middle school\n\n November 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 560\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — The Caroline County Commissioners were given an update Tuesday morning on potential plans for a new middle school in the county.Bill Mengel, director of operations at Caroline County Public Schools, presented a revised fiscal year 2026 capital improvement plan to the commission. That improvement plan includes a priority item of year one and year two funding for a potential new middle school building.\nMengel noted that while the district was in the \"talking phase\" in August and September, it has \"transitioned into the planning phase.\" This will soon include working with a consultant and eventually procuring a feasibility study, which may be complete in around six to eight months, Mengel said.\n\"One thing I've learned about building a new school is that it's a very serious endeavor,\" he said. \"It takes a very long time to build one, approximately five years. But things change very, very quickly. That's really what kind of happened here, early October.\"\nCurrently, Colonel Richardson Middle School in Federalsburg and Lockerman Middle School in Denton serve as the district's two middle schools. It is unclear if the district will aim to build an entire new school, renovate, or add on. Mengel said those outcomes are largely dependent on the feasibility study's recommendation and the Board of Education's subsequent approval or denial.\nThe revised capital improvement plan was unanimously approved by the three commissioners Tuesday. Its top priority requests are $500,000 for HVAC work at Denton Elementary School and $5.5 million in early planning and design costs for a new or expanded middle school over the next two fiscal years.\n$76 million in requested funding from the state for a new middle school build is listed next on the form. Mengel said that $76 million in requested state funding is around 89% of the total $86 million estimation for years one and two, meaning the county would be responsible for around 11% of the funding.\nMaryland's Interagency Commission on School Construction, which the funding form will be submitted to, is looking at an approximate capacity of 126,000 square feet for a potential new build, according to Mengel. Mengel said the district's main point of negotiation is \"How do we get more square footage?\"\nCost per square foot has risen sharply year to year, the director of operations noted.\n\"If we get shovels in the ground in FY28 and we're able to move in for FY30 school year, that could be at or north of $490 per square foot,\" Mengel said. \"So that's the driver.\"\nCommission President Travis Breeding asked that the school district keep the county updated on the early planning and feasibility study results.\n\"Keep us in the loop on the study, because we would like to, if we're on the hook for 11% of this, we'd like to have input into, is it a renovation, addition, new location, all those discussions,\" Breeding said.\nMengel said he doesn't want work to begin on a large capital project if it's not set to accommodate increases in student population.\n\"I am aware, and so is the Board of Education, that there are some communities that are planned in and around Denton and points north (in) Caroline County,\" Mengel said. \"We expect that there will be some students moving in impacting our populations. The last thing I want to do a build such as this, and then have it be at 100% occupancy within a couple of years.\" \n\n ",

    "date": "2024-11-30",

    "content": "More than half of Talbot County students receive free and reduced lunches\n\n November 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Life \n \n 944\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — More than half of students in Talbot County Public Schools receive free or reduced cost meals at school every week, according to the Maryland Department of Education.Free and reduced meals allow them to eat well at school.\n\"It is basically healthy for them. They get a fruit, a vegetable, a protein and they get a milk,\" said Michelle Garniga, assistant coordinator at the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center for the after school program. She has six children in TCPS.\nThe number of free and reduced meals in a school is a measure of poverty and food insecurity in a community.\nThe Maryland Department of Education found 58.41% of the students in Talbot County received free and reduced meals in 2022-2023, just under 13% higher than it was the school year prior.\nAt some county schools, this rate is even higher.\n\"What drives up the numbers are Easton Middle School and Easton Elementary School,\" said Catharine Poe of the Talbot Hunger Coalition, an organization of food banks and resources fighting food insecurity in the county. \"Easton Elementary is 76% and the Middle School is 64%.\"\nAt other schools, numbers alone may not be enough to gauge the full scope of students' needs. Poe said the Easton High numbers trend lower because the kids do not want the other kids to know they need food.\nDebbie Gardner, communications director for Talbot County Public Schools, said \"We definitely talk about hunger. We consider feeding children to be one of our responsibilities in addition to educating them. We know the needs are greater than even what we see on paper.\"\nFOOD INSECURITYThe increased rate of students receiving free and reduced meals mirrors a growing amount of food insecurity in Talbot County, where costs of food, housing and other necessities are outpacing salary growth.\n\"If you make $15 an hour (minimum wage) and work every single day for a 40 hour week, you only make $31,000. So if you have a family, that is not going to go very far. As soon as you have multiple children, it becomes impossible,\" Poe said. She said you need $38,000 for one person to make it in Talbot County.\nEmily Moody, cofounder of CarePacks, said they started the nonprofit because \"on weekends some kids were not eating until they got back to school on Monday morning. That is the nature of food insecurity — the uncertainty. Free and reduced meals are a lifeline. No question about it.\"\n\"Food insecurity is on the rise everywhere,\" Moody said. \"What we have seen in the school system is an increase in the free and reduced meals program. People are working, but at wages that are not a livable wage and we live in an area where the cost of housing is really exorbitant. The cost for basic necessities like food and gas and utilities have increased. The place where the budget gets squeezed is with food at the grocery budget.\"\nKatie Fox, community school program manager at Easton Elementary School, is the school based coordinator for CarePacks.\n\"Transportation impacts, if you don't have reliable transportation, which a lot of people in Talbot County don't have. That is a non-negotiable,\" Fox said.\nAnd if you live in the far corners of Talbot County like Tilghman Island, it is hard to even get to a grocery store.\"\nMoody said, \"For people who are working full time to be able to afford housing and afford transportation and insurance and utilities. When those needs are met , then ideally there is room in your budget to be able to feed your family too.\"\nIt is not an issue of lazy for the working poor.\n\"It is not that people are not going to work. It is just that living is really expensive right now,\" Fox said.\nFREE AND REDUCED MEALS HELPFamilies in need benefit from the free and reduced meals at the TCPS, which ensure students receive at least two meals a day for five days a week.\n\"It is not easy to give $4 every single day to four or five kids. That is like $24 a day. It would be fairer if everyone got free food. Just because you make more money, it is not fair for kids not to get the lunch,\" Garniga said.\nGarniga said without the program she would be in debt and that over $100 a week for food would be a lot.\n\"It takes a lot of pressure off especially if you have a household with several kids. Being able to rely on the school system to provide breakfast and lunch every day, it is one of the biggest roles that the school plays,\" Poe said.\n\"They have figured out that it would save the average family $1,200 a child each year. It would end all this, and everybody who goes to school gets a free meal,\" Poe said.\nChildren in Talbot County are not alone in experiencing the benefits of free and reduced lunch programs.\nAt the state level, Gov. Wes Moore has signed a state Senate bill requiring the Maryland Department of Education to report to the General Assembly how much it will cost to provide free meals to all public school students in Maryland.\nSB 579 opens with, \"The Maryland General Assembly recognizes the positive impact on student's academic, physical and social and emotional health that results from ensuring students have access to breakfast and lunch programs while at school.\"\nFiguring out how much it costs is the next step in pursuing universal expansion of free school meals, lawmakers argue.\nThe bill still needs to be funded, and it looks like the state budget is getting tighter. According to the latest briefing in the state's Spending Affordability Committee, there is a projected $2.7 billion budget shortfall that will confront the state legislature in January. \n\n © Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She previously worked at Caroline County Public Schools in various teacher and administrative roles for a combined 36 years, retiring in 2009.\n\"I can promise you as president of your board, I will do the very best that I can do,\" Wayman said during Tuesday evening's meeting.\nBartz nominated Mark Jones to once again serve as vice president of the board alongside Weaver. All five members voted in favor.\nBartz, who was appointed in June to the Board of Education, ran unopposed in District 1. She is the director of community based programs at Choptank Community Health, overseeing the school-based health centers and serving as a provider at Greensboro Elementary.\nIn an interview, she said she's \"excited\" about the district's direction, particularly the fact that eight of nine schools are designated community schools by the state's education initiative, Blueprint for Maryland's Future.\n\"In a county that's rural, it is really important that we recognize that our schools really are hubs in our community and that we can bring a lot of resources to families and kids alongside of the education that they receive in those buildings,\" Bartz said. \"It's a safe place for families.\"\nAssuming outgoing President Richard Barton's District 2 seat is Johnson, who also ran unopposed. In an interview with the Star Democrat, Johnson said she's looking forward to the new role.\nAt first, she was hesitant about running, but the idea grew over time as she thought about her 11- and 14-year-old daughters, who both attend Caroline County schools. She said it's a great way to be a part of \"conversations that can make change.\"\n\"When you're a parent sitting on the 'outside, you hear all of these things, and they may not necessarily make sense to you as a parent,\" Johnson said. \"People get in their emotions and they run with that.

Stars are gained using multiple indicators, including academic achievement, academic progress, graduation rate and school quality.\nAccording to the report card, the academic achievement indicator went up 0.2 points — from 7.6 to 7.8 — overall at Dorchester elementary schools. At Dorchester middle schools, the academic achievement indicator went up 0.6 points, from 6.7 to 7.3 points. Elementary and middle schools can receive up to 20 points for academic achievement.\nDorchester high schools increased their academic achievement overall by 1.1 point, from 12 to 13.1 points. High schools can receive up to 30 points for academic achievement.\nThe school district news release also stated districtwide improvement in English language arts and math proficiency as well as improved graduation and attendance rates.\n\"While our schools have shown movement in a positive direction, some areas and schools have seen significant gains with others advancing more slowly,\" Superintendent Jymil Thompson said in the news release. \"To achieve our ambitious goal of moving from 23rd to 15th in academic performance statewide, a larger percentage of growth is necessary. Continued focus on targeted strategies and interventions will be crucial to accelerate this progress.\"\nSince becoming superintendent in June, Thompson has made known his hope of bringing the district's ranking up from 23rd to 15th in the state in four years. This year, the district is focusing on instructional leadership, taking a top-down approach in an effort to improve student success.\nIn September, Thompson told the Star Democrat that in order to jump from 23rd in the state to 15th in four years, the district will need to be consistent with developing instructional leadership and following through on it.\n\"Making sure that I'm having meetings with the principals, having conversations on how they're progressing on their goals,\" he said in September. \"And if they're not progressing, how can we shift and go in a little different direction to ensure that they're meeting their goals?\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline superintendent projects 'good budget year,' discusses Blueprint\n\n December 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 617\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — At last week's Caroline County Board of Education meeting, Superintendent Derek Simmons provided board members with a preview into the district's fiscal year 2026 outlook as budget season nears.Simmons said he and his team are in the process of developing a draft budget. What happens in this year's state legislative session is expected to impact how the budget looks, the superintendent said.\n\"We are really contingent upon what happens at the state level for our funding, and we do expect the General Assembly to be very engaged in things that could impact us budget-wise,\" Simmons said. \"So it is 100% likely we will not have a clear picture of our budget, of our revenue numbers until mid-April at best.\"\nAt the Dec. 3 meeting, Simmons reviewed the fiscal year 2025 budget, noting that around 60% of unrestricted funds were spent on salaries and wages. Those funds largely come from the state, as the district received around 66% of its FY25 revenue from the state in unrestricted money.\n\"When we talk about where our expenses come from, it's people,\" Simmons said. \"No surprise as we've said for years, we are a people business. It takes people to educate children. It takes people to make school work.\"\nContracted services accounted for just under 7% of the unrestricted budget. Board Member Troy Plutschak said he wants the board to find out how much auditing through outside companies costs.\nSimmons said the district is often audited, but that moving audits in-house would be difficult and put the district in a \"world of hurt.\" Potentially, one or two finance-related positions would be added, along with adding a stress onto the workload of school principals, Simmons said.\nAccording to the superintendent, he doesn't expect federal money or county allocations to drastically change heading into fiscal year '26. \"We knew '25 was the tight year,\" he said.\nAssuming no major changes are made to the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's initiative to increase education funding, Simmons has an optimistic outlook. That's partly due to increased multilingual learner, special education and overall enrollment in the county.\n\"We are anticipating what should be a good budget year for Caroline County Public Schools,\" Simmons told the board.\nBLUEPRINTWhile there was positivity in the fiscal year 26 forecast, Simmons made clear to board members that the outlook could drastically change if state legislators enact major adjustments to funding in Blueprint.\nChanges to fiscal 26 funding \"can have absolute detrimental impacts to Caroline County Public Schools,\" he said, since Caroline County Public Schools is \"not a district that has extra wealth to go to to fill gaps.\"\n\"Not trying to paint a dire picture, but I don't want to paint roses where they may not exist,\" he said. \"They should. But I want to make sure that everybody in the public is very clear as well. It should be, but if they go changing things in the FY 26 formula, it will hurt in this county more so than others probably.\"\nState legislators may be tasked with discussions about Blueprint funding this winter, as the state faces a predicted budget deficit of $2.7 million for fiscal year 2026.\nBlueprint will require all schools to meet a minimum teacher salary of $26,000 by July 2026. Caroline County Public Schools has not met that mark yet, but Simmons said the district is making progress.\n\"We are still working to get our starting teacher salary up to the mandated $60,000 by FY27,\" Simmons said. \"We have done a great job through negotiations. We're roughly $5,000 away.\"\nLooking to the next budget cycle, salaries and maintaining adequate staffing levels are at the top of mind for the superintendent and his team.\n\"We need to stay competitive with salaries and benefits for all employees,\" Simmons said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, Easton Middle was the lone school in the district to lose a star compared to 2023 ratings.The report card, released by the Maryland State Department of Education on Dec. 3, awards schools points based on performance in four categories: academic achievement, academic progress, progressing in achieving English language arts proficiency, and school quality and student success.\nEaston Middle notched a two-star rating and 32nd percentile rank, down from three stars and 48th percentile last year. Star rating and percentile rank are based off of a school's total points out of 100. Easton Middle scored 44, down from 46.1 in 2023.\nEaston Middle's 2024 scores in academic achievement (7.7 out of 30) and academic progress (16.7 out of 35) remained the same. It increased slightly in English proficiency, from 2.2 to 2.6 out of 10 total points, while decreasing from 19.5 to 17.1 points out of 35 total in school quality and student success.\nTalbot County Public Schools' Director of Communications Debbie Gardner said in a statement that the district is \"closely examining\" the report card results. \"Findings and recommendations\" will be presented to the Talbot County Board of Education at its Dec. 18 meeting, she added.\n\"We are encouraged by the improvement shown in student proficiency in both math and English language arts in all of our student groups,\" the statement read. \"There was progress in other areas as a result of our continued focus on our district priorities. We also see opportunities for additional data collection and analysis to inform our short and long-term planning.\"\nOf the eight schools in the district, St. Michaels Elementary rose from three to four stars, while White Marsh Elementary had the district's largest percentile increase, from the 69th in 2023 to the 82nd percentile in 2024.\nOTHER SCHOOLSOf all schools in Caroline, Dorchester and Talbot counties, Easton Middle was the only one to see a year-to-year decrease in its star rating, though other schools did drop in their percentiles or overall points.\nCompared to fellow middle schools, Easton's 2024 rank slots in above Mace's Lane Middle (two stars, 6th percentile) and Lockerman Middle (two stars, 30th percentile), but below North Dorchester Middle (three stars, 56th percentile) and Colonel Richardson Middle (three stars, 62nd percentile).\nBy student group, the Easton school had mixed results. All student groups saw year-to-year increases in English proficiency except for Black and African American students. Asian students and economically disadvantaged students reached their annual targets in English proficiency, according to the report card results.\nHowever, in math proficiency, only Asian students and multilingual learners improved from 2023. None of the subgroups reached their annual targets in math proficiency.\nTo view the full Maryland School Report Card, visit reportcard.msde.maryland.gov/. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore (D), Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County). The letter stated that record education spending by Maryland counties in recent years and additional mandated funding for Blueprint will make it difficult for counties to fund other things in their jurisdictions.\nDuring Thursday's MACo session, titled \"What we've learned About Learning: The Blueprint in Year Three,\" panelist and Charles County Blueprint Coordinator Christina Miller spoke on the importance of equity, saying that it's not only important to make sure every district gets a shoe, but every district gets a \"shoe that fits.\" She said it is time for a readjustment of Blueprint.\n\"Are we calling the baby ugly? No,\" she said. \"But frankly, it is time for an assessment to see what's working and what's not working.\"\nPanelist and Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said that something written three years ago isn't going be perfect today. He said everything needs to be revisited.\n\"The Blueprint is no different,\" he said. \"We can still achieve the outcomes. We can probably do them better if we take the time to revisit what was passed with a lens of local flexibility and understanding (the) context of each and every 24 (local education agencies).\"\nPanelist and Harford County Public Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson pointed to some of the progress his district has made in implementing the Blueprint before mentioning recommendations made by the state's superintendents to reduce the Blueprint's overall cost.\nBulson said achievements in his county include making \"good progress\" toward increasing teacher starting salaries to $60,000. He said last school year, no 4-year-olds \"with the greatest needs\" were turned away from public pre-K in Harford County.\n\"While this isn't the end goal that the Blueprint envisioned, it's great progress that, again, wouldn't have been made without the Blueprint,\" Bulson said.\nDuring the question-and-answer portion of the session, St. Mary's County Commissioner Mike Hewitt said he didn't want to raise county taxes in order to pay for the Blueprint. He asked the moderator of the session, Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Wicomico, Worcester), what can be expected from the General Assembly.\nCarozza said Gov. Wes Moore has said he would be willing to make some adjustments to Blueprint. She said it will be important that the school districts and counties stand together with their priorities \"(so) that we can make the changes that you're calling for.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The program serves pre-K through second graders in the district.\nThe agreement will allow the current Positive Change Academy staff to finish out the school year.\nIn October, the board voted to terminate a one-year contract with Transforming Lives, the company that brought the Positive Change Academy to the district. Transforming Lives had been using PASS Educators to provide staffing at the academy.\nIn an email Friday, DCPS Communications and Community Outreach Specialist Valerie Goff said the academy is still under contract with Transforming Lives, but that contract is \"due to end imminently.\"\nWith the new agreement, the Positive Change Academy staff provided by PASS Educators will be able to continue to serve district students after the contract has been terminated.\nAt the board's last meeting in November, the board voted against pursuing contracts with other alternative education companies that reached out through a request for proposal.\nSuperintendent Jymil Thompson said at the November meeting that the district and board had reviewed the proposals and he recommended they not move forward with any of them due to \"budgetary restraints.\" He said the district would instead work to continue staffing its Positive Change Academy.\nThe agreement with PASS Educators will cost the district $238,000.\nBefore the board voted on the PASS Educators agreement, multiple people — including Positive Change Academy staff — spoke in favor of it.\nRonnell Page, the founder of PASS Educators, said his company was introduced to Dorchester County Public Schools about three months ago due to an \"essential need\" with the elementary alternative education program. He said that over the past two months, he has been traveling to the district to show support. He said they have staff in place that \"genuinely cares\" and wants to do the best for the students.\n\"We really believe we can make a huge impact from Hurlock all the way to Cambridge,\" he said.\nDane Harris, the principal at the Positive Change Academy, said that when he stepped into the role, the program was \"in a state of crisis.\" He said that since then, there has been \"undeniable\" growth, both academically and behaviorally. Harris said this wouldn't be possible without the academy's current staff.\n\"The staff members are not just employees, they are the backbone of this program,\" he said. \"They've earned the trust of students. They deserve the opportunity to continue to do great work.\"\nAfter the board voted in favor of the agreement, people in the audience clapped.\nAt the end of the meeting, board member Brandy Dawson Cumberland spoke about the importance of consistency for students. She said she hopes the district can have a steady program without \"consistent turnover.\"\nBoard member Christine LaMonica thanked those from the Positive Change Academy that spoke during the meeting.\n\"I think as we sit here as a board and always consider our students first, it's good to hear that there's passion for our students and for their academic achievement, as well as their behavioral and mental health,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They will remain in those roles for a year.\nIn July, Hubbard and Chikwendu were elected to their respective roles after former Board President Mike Diaz and former Vice President Susan Morgan resigned for separate reasons.\nDuring the meeting Dec. 12, Hubbard thanked the board for their \"vote of confidence.\"\n\"I will try to do my very best to serve you well,\" she said.\nAt the end of the meeting, other board members congratulated the two.\n\"Thank you for your leadership and for agreeing to continue,\" board member Chris Wheedleton said.\nWheedleton and fellow board members Brandy Dawson Cumberland and Christine LaMonica were all sworn in for another term at the beginning of the same meeting.\nThis will be Wheedleton, Cumberland and LaMonica's first full term. All three were appointed to replace former board members.\nWheedleton was appointed to the board in 2023 to replace former board member Laura Layton, who resigned from the board that April. Wheedleton won against Jerome Harris to maintain his seat in the recent Nov. 5 general election.\nIn July, both LaMonica and Cumberland were appointed to the board. LaMonica was appointed to fill Morgan's seat after she resigned in mid-June following a contentious board vote to terminate an alternative education contract.\nCumberland was appointed to fill Diaz's seat after he resigned in late June, citing family and health concerns.\nBefore being appointed, LaMonica and Cumberland had been running against Morgan and Diaz, respectively, in the 2024 general election. Both LaMonica and Cumberland ultimately ran unopposed in the November election, allowing them to stay in the roles they were appointed to for another four years. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Budget discussions kicked off at Talbot Board of Ed work session\n\n December 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 619\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot Board of Education was presented with preliminary budget considerations during a Monday work session as planning for the fiscal year 2026 budget is underway.Talbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones outlined the priorities her team is focusing on. Those priorities include achieving academic equity in math, fostering an engaging environment for students and staff, and recruiting and retaining staff members.\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi said those areas were determined as priorities during a board retreat last year.\n\"When the dust all ended, we said that these were the three priorities that we wanted to move forward with,\" Pepukayi said. \" … And then most recently, we've talked about special education being a focus for us as well.\"\nDuring the meeting, Jones provided an overview of the budget process and how the state's expansive 10-year education funding initiative, The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, allocates money on a per-student basis.\n\"Every student in our system grades (K-12) qualifies for a base amount, and that's called our foundation funding,\" Jones said. \"That's how we keep our lights on. That's how we have insurance.\"\nThen, depending on student classifications in other categories, such as multilingual learners and special education, more money is allocated to a school. Each school receives different funding based on their enrollment statistics, Jones said.\nShe added that the expectation from the state is that \"at least 75%\" of the money given toward a certain school is \"spent directly at that school.\" Costs related to human resources, finance and transportation often aren't school-specific.\nAccording to Jones, the district needs to \"make some shifts\" in two programs — compensatory education and multilingual learners — in order to comply with Blueprint requirements. No district in the state is fully compliant at this time, she noted, but the Blueprint Accountability & Implementation Board is seeking progress.\n\"We're just not spending enough money on those areas to meet criteria,\" Jones said.\nPepukayi said the strict requirements affect funding for smaller schools, a topic that's come up in her discussions with fellow superintendents on the Eastern Shore.\n\"The foundation funding is insufficient to do all that we need to do, particularly for the smaller schools, the districts that have smaller schools,\" she said. \" … It's compliance-driven and rigidness for our budgeting versus giving us the flexibility to make those decisions and differentiate ourselves.\"\nSchools and departments in the district submit budgets every year, along with providing a list of requested positions. Position requests include teachers, coaches, English second language professionals, special education staff and social workers.\n\"We're not at the level where we were at last year,\" Jones added.\nBoard President Emily Jackson brought up whether or not the district could revisit previous hopes to hire someone for a grants manager position since managing grants is a significant stress on the finance department.\nJones said it's \"burdensome\" to track all of the necessary results and data from grants.\n\"You have to have a really detailed knowledge of the public education landscape to be able to write those grants, I would say,\" Jones said. \"And that was our challenge.\"\nHowever, Jones was optimistic on the prospect that a grants manager could eventually help Talbot County Public Schools bring in more revenue.\n\"Hiring a grant person might make sense financially,\" she said. \"They might at least be able to pay for themselves, and then hopefully generate some revenue in other ways.\"\nThe Talbot County Board of Education will meet with the Talbot County Council on Jan. 7 to discuss a proposed budget. The proposed budget will first be brought to the board at a Jan. 13 work session, and then on Jan. 15 for first reader.\nAs of now, a public hearing on the budget is scheduled for Feb. 10, with a potential board vote slated for Feb. 12. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot leaders optimistic about improvements at Easton Middle, across TCPS\n\n December 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 697\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — During its monthly meeting, the Talbot County Board of Education was provided with a detailed look into the Maryland School Report Card results, including where improvements may be needed.Released by the Maryland Department of Education earlier this month, the report card awards schools points based on performance in four categories: academic achievement, academic progress, English language arts proficiency progress, and school quality and student success.\nSt. Michaels Elementary School rose from three stars in 2023 to four stars this year, while White Marsh Elementary School — which remained steady at four stars — produced significant gains in test scores and percentile ranks.\nHelga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, focused her presentation on Easton Middle School, which was the district's only school to have a year-to-year drop in its star rating.\nShe explained what caused the school's rating to drop from three stars to two stars and pinpointed improvements that weren't reflected in the report card.\n\"Given the number of factors that make up this star rating and the complexity of the formulas, I wanted to share with you a deeper dive into what impacted the decrease in stars for Easton Middle School so we all have a better understanding of what's happening,\" Einhorn said.\nEinhorn noted that there were small increases in academic achievement and academic progress at Easton Middle. \"It was not notable in the MSDE reporting because they truncate the values for their calculations,\" she said.\nThe state report did show an increase in points scored for English proficiency. That and the small gains in the other categories show the school's progress, Einhorn says.\n\"The steps that (Principal Kelly Murdoch) and her school are putting in place at Easton Middle are having an impact in improving outcomes for students,\" Einhorn said, \"even though it doesn't show up in that calculation for the star rating.\"\nEaston Middle's score for school quality and student success dropped from 19.5 points in 2023 to 17.1 points in 2024, which largely caused the star rating drop. Einhorn said that mostly stemmed from the rate of chronically absent students, the \"largest single measure that impacts the star rating of a school.\"\nA common misconception is that only unexcused absences count toward considering a student chronically absent. That is not the case, Einhorn said, emphasizing that both excused and unexcused absences count in the tracking for whether a student is chronically absent or not according to the state.\n\"(Do) we have some investigation going on into what is causing that so it's not carried over into the high school?\" Board Member Karla Wieland-Cherry asked.\nEinhorn said the district has \"several checkpoints\" in place and is working with teachers, social workers and administrators to reduce chronic absenteeism.\nBoard Vice President Amy Dodson expressed optimism about the work being done to improve student achievement at Easton Middle.\n\"I've spoken to some parents of students at Easton Middle, and they give glowing reports of what they're doing over there,\" Dodson said. \"And some of our neighboring counties did not fare so well with the star system. So keep up the work, there's still plenty of work to do.\"\n\"I see every day the work that Easton Middle School is doing, so to have this be the measure of your work is really hard,\" responded Einhorn. \"I appreciate your recognition of what's happening there and the effort they're putting in.\"\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the district is constantly assessing school performance and data internally in order to \"(celebrate) the growth that we're seeing at Easton Middle School and all of our schools.\"\n\"We take our own internal approach, and we just don't wait for the stars to come out every one time a year, or the (Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program test scores) to come out one time a year,\" Pepukayi said.\nEinhorn said while she didn't want to \"suggest that we should be happy with a two-star rating,\" she hoped the detailed breakdown provided context around how Easton Middle is improving.\n\"I know that with time (and) support from this board that Easton Middle School will continue to see gains in their school improvement efforts,\" Einhorn said. \"I'm really proud of their innovation and persistence in looking at ways to improve outcomes for the students they serve.\" \n\n © Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed voices mixed opinions over 2025-26 calendar draft\n\n December 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 548\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A draft version of a calendar for the 2025-2026 school year drew varying opinions from Talbot County Board of Education members on Wednesday evening.The calendar committee, which plans the district's upcoming calendars, put together the draft that was shown Wednesday. It included two days off in the second week of March 2026 for students and a five-day spring break for students from April 2 to April 6, 2026.\n\"The thinking of the committee was to put some days off in March, and then to do the April holiday,\" Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, said. \"Dividing the break would also minimize the impact on our students who rely on the support of our schools for their meal support.\"\nBoard President Emily Jackson, who serves on the calendar committee, expressed confusion with the draft calendar that Einhorn presented.\n\"It was a surprisingly contentious group, with a huge set of ideas that ran the gamut,\" Jackson said of the committee. \"So what I am seeing presented today, to me, does not accurately reflect what I took away from the discussions that were had.\"\nJackson said she was expecting multiple draft calendars, not just one. She added that past surveys have indicated there are strong opinions on extending spring break and having \"time for teachers in their classrooms without students.\"\n\"Personally, I come back to wanting to give our community what they're asking for,\" Jackson said. \"So I'm looking for a calendar that has an actual spring break on it.\"\nBoard Member Deborah Bridges said she liked the two days off in March.\n\"I think the March break is wonderful from a mental health standpoint, because March is long, dreary,\" Bridges said. \"And everybody — kids, parents and teachers — need a little break, and I think that's a really good thing to do.\"\nBoard Member Dyshekia Strawberry raised concerns that the shorter spring break could increase chronic absenteeism in April. Vice President Amy Dodson said while the draft calendar \"looks good,\" an off day in March could possibly be moved to extend spring break.\nJackson also brought up the possibility of staggered starts for students in \"transition\" grades that are starting at new schools. Einhorn said that she is waiting on direction from the state to understand how other districts do staggered starts while still complying with 180-day requirements.\nFeedback from Wednesday's meeting will be taken back to the calendar committee and discussed before a draft calendar is presented for second reader at the board's January meeting.\nEinhorn said it'd be possible for the committee to look at keeping the two off days in March, as well as extending spring break, by moving the last day of school back.\nJackson vouched for \"consistent breaks\" in order to accommodate student needs surrounding mental health, travel needs, college tours and more.\n\"There are ways to put this together that do make sense and don't look like this,\" the board president said.\n\"I think we have to put everything out on the table because we have constraints,\" Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said. \"We can't have it both ways.\n\"And while I know we want extra days off, I hear loud and clear from parents (about) child care. But we also want to balance, because I also hear from staff, more planning time. We just have to find out, what is that balance?\" \n\n Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

A $500,000 grant was given to the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation, which is funding STEM centers at 10 different schools in Maryland, including Lockerman.\nCaroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said the foundation's contribution is bringing unique experiences to Lockerman students.\n\"There's no way that this level of resource and these tools would be able to get in the hands of our middle school kids if it wasn't for your partnership and Ripken Foundation's work,\" Simmons said.\nOn Tuesday, students showed off the new tools and gadgets that were funded by the grant, such as a 3D printer, coding robots and electronic kits. In the school cafeteria, two students flew drones.\nSixth grader Gracie Spiering showed off her knowledge of how to make backpack security alarms or model cars using littleBits Electronic kits. She knew how to order the kit's pieces and wires, and learned how the coding worked.\n\"It's been so much fun to have in class,\" Spiering said. \"Everybody's been so ready to come into that class.\"\nMeanwhile, many students have been utilizing the 3D printers to make ornaments for the holidays. Seventh grader Madison Watson said it's been a smooth learning process thanks to the help of her teachers.\n\"It's pretty fun to have them just at any time we really want them to be here,\" Watson said.\nLockerman Middle School Principal Jeannine Necessary said students love learning how to use the new materials. Staff members were trained and encouraged to integrate the STEM tools into everyday learning, the principal said.\nDuring the ribbon-cutting, University of Maryland Shore Regional Health President and CEO Ken Kozel said the healthcare system appreciates students involved in STEM because the students are \"highly motivated and educated.\"\n\"We're here to promote STEM because it's such an important part of the healthcare system,\" Kozel said. \"We're local, we're small, we're a community hospital system, but we need our community to help support our workforce needs.\"\nWith a handful of students excited to show off the new technology on Tuesday, Simmons reflected on how much the grant means to the Denton middle school, given the district's financial challenges.\n\"About 60 to 65 percent of our students qualify for free and reduced meals, which puts a little bit different lens on the opportunities that our kids have to access things,\" Simmons said. \"It also puts a lens on the opportunity the school system has funding-wise to be able to provide those avenues.\n\"We are thrilled that we were selected by you guys, in partnership with the Ripken Foundation, to be able to provide opportunity and access that we could've never funded for our students.\" \n\n Copyright 2024",

This application is due in March, she said.\nStudents will be selected for enrollment via lottery, with all county students eligible to attend, she said.\nOptions for school facilities are still being explored with the hopes to mirror Frederick County and Anne Arundel counties' business park locations, Scott said.\n\"It would be a real feather in the cap of Queen Anne's County to have the first one on the Eastern Shore,\" Scott said.\nA public meeting about QACCS welcomes the community to learn more Jan. 25, 2025 at 10 a.m. at Kent Island Fire Department, 1610 Main Street in Chester.\nMore information including a petition of support can be found at QueenAnnesCCS.com and its Facebook page. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Board of Public Works approved funding for the study at its Dec. 4 meeting.\n\"This issue is exacerbated for undocumented students or citizen children of undocumented parents,\" Lierman said at that meeting.\nThe current method of tabulating poverty \"really penalizes\" schools with large numbers of immigrant students, Lierman said.\nThe state currently uses proxy measures, such as eligibility for national programs like Medicaid and SNAP, to calculate aid for public schools, according to the proposal for funds from the Department of General Services.\nAccording to the Governor's Office for Children, an accurate count of students in poverty is important to ensure that they get adequate resources. The office also told CNS that the \"Blueprint for Maryland's Future created several new school funding streams that rely on counts of low-income students.\"\nSchools currently rely on applications for the free and reduced meals program and enrollment in social programs like Medicaid as methods of calculating student poverty. According to the Governor's Office for Children, \"not all low income families participate in these programs.\"\nThe office also said that \"districts that provide free school meals to all students under the federal community eligibility program do not collect that data.\"\nIn the case of immigrant families, some may not qualify or, as the office told CNS, may be hesitant to enroll and reveal their citizenship status.\nOther data the state might rely upon is out of date. According to Lierman, the Maryland State Department of Education recently proposed using data from 2013 to calculate school poverty in Baltimore City. Lierman said that many public schools have been shuttered in the city since that data was collected.\n\"As a Baltimore City Public School mom,\" Lierman said, \"I've got a lot of strong feelings about this.\"\nThe board approved the DGS request for $48,000 monthly for \"modeling, analysis and providing a presentation on findings.\"\nAccording to the Office for Children, a recommendation based on the results of the study will be made to the Maryland General Assembly by Dec. 1, 2025. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Phone pouches improving student focus, discipline in Caroline, district says\n\n January 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 624\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n An experimental pilot program aimed at keeping students off their phones saw some success in its first semester being implemented at Caroline County Public Schools.Cellphone pouches created by the company Yondr were tested in both Caroline County middle schools last semester.\n\"We've been pleased with the outcome, Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"You see attentiveness much higher in classrooms, kids learning how to talk to each other, even in the cafeteria. It's been really cool to see at the middle schools.\"\nThe students carry locked pouches during the entire school day, with their phones inside but not accessible.\nEach student has their own pouch, which travels with them daily from home to school. Phone are locked into the pouches at the beginning of the school day and unlocked at the end using a magnetic device. If a student leaves the pouch at home, they put their phone in the school office for the day.\nEvery classroom in Caroline County comes equipped with a wired phone for use in case of an emergency, and teachers have been given a special pair of scissors to cut through cellphone pouches if needed.\nFor students with health needs, the schools offer special services allowing students to check their phones for medical purposes only.\nThere have been talks within the county of expanding cellphone pouches to ninth graders in coming years, but that determination has not yet been made, district officials said.\nIn determining whether the pouch program will be expected, the district still has to weigh the pros and cons, officials said. They hope that by the end of the school year they will have a solid understanding of the program's successes and shortcomings.\nSUCCESSES\nThe pouches have done a good job at keeping students off their phones during the school day, district officials said. But beyond that, the middle schools where the pouches have been implemented have seen some other benefits from the program.\nThe cellphone pouches help prevent cyber bullying in the school during the school day, they said. Students have needed less disciplinary intervention since the pouches were rolled out.\n\"We've seen about a 21% reduction in discipline incidents,\" Simmons said.\nSimmons also said teachers report that taking cellphones out of the picture has allowed them to better focus on instructing students.\n\"We ask a lot of our teachers, most of our class sizes average 20 to 20 plus students, so if you're asking them to improve reading or improve mathematics on top of being able to see if they're on cellphones it's a lot,\" Simmons said. \"With the pouches they don't have to be the cellphone police.\"\nAlthough schools don't yet have test scores back for last semester, the superintendent said pass rates have gone up with the cellphone pouches.\nDIFFICULTIES\nReception of the cellphone pouches has not been entierly positive among students and parents in the district, Simmons said.\nStudents have tried to tamper with or break into their pouches during the school day on multiple occasions.\n\"They're not indestructible, they're not the end all be all, but they are a great preventative tool to put in place,\" Simmons said. \"They're easy to tell if somebody's tampered with one, It's also easy to tell if a kid has their phone or has a phone out because they don't want their pouch or pouches to look empty.\"\nSome parents do not like the idea of the phone pouches because they prefer to have a direct line of communication with their child, Simmons said.\nStudents have not yet been polled on their feelings about the pouches, but the districts plans to weigh student attitudes toward the program in any future decisions made.\n\"I think overall, we're seeing a positive impact on the academics, on the social skills piece. If we asked kids if they'd rather have access to their devices, I'm sure they would,\" Simmons said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Talbot Board of Ed Sees Initial Budget Proposal",
    "date": "2025-01-15",
    "author": "Konner Metz",
    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed sees initial budget proposal\n\n January 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 720\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot Board of Education had its first look at the district's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 Monday.During a board work session Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones presented the draft budget, which totals $85.8 million in unrestricted dollars — an $8.6 million increase from fiscal year 2025, Jones noted.\nJones provided the year-to-year budget changes by looking at 12 different categories of expenditures. The areas in which increases were highest are fixed charges ($2.23 million increase), instructional salaries ($1.7 million increase) and other instructional costs ($1.47 million increase).\nJones added that while $9 million to $10 million in grants are expected next year, anticipated grant funding is more than $5 million less than last fiscal year. That drop in grant funding precipitated a portion of the rise in the requested unrestricted budget.\nIn Annapolis, it still remains to be seen how Maryland's expected $2.7 billion deficit is tackled and if legislative decisions will impact funding for The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education improvement and funding initiative.\nTalbot school leaders say budgeting will be a fluid process in the coming months as they keep an eye on state legislation and the Accountability & Implementation Board, an entity that ensures the state and county governments are correctly implementing Blueprint.\n\"There's one area where I did do a little bit of hedging our bets, on the conservative side,\" Jones said of the proposed budget. \"I don't think we'll know any of that until April or May. But as certain pieces of legislation gather steam and seem to gather support and seem likely, then I think we will work behind the scenes to figure out how we will address this if this comes to fruition.\"\nIn creating the draft budget, Jones and Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi emphasized that the district considered its top priorities: academic equity in math, an engaging environment for students and staff, recruitment and retention levels, and meeting Blueprint objectives.\nMonday's discussion included a breakdown of 33 proposed additional positions for the next fiscal year. The proposed budget includes a $3.6 million jump in salaries and wages.\n\"This list is whittled down, if you can believe it, from a longer list of wants and desires,\" Jones said. \"And it was very much informed by school administration. This is what they felt they needed in their buildings.\"\nADDITIONAL POSITIONSJones outlined the 33 additional positions that are in the requested budget. Six of those positions are for English for Speakers of Other Languages teachers, assistants or coaches.\nShe cited the district's need to serve its multilingual population, along with the state funding for multilingual learning, for adding the positions.\n\"Our (Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program) data … demonstrates that we do consistently underserve our multilingual students,\" Jones said. \"And so, we just need to provide more resources there.\"\nBoard of Education President Emily Jackson asked if those English for Speakers of Other Languages positions will be difficult to fill.\n\"Because I know we've had problems — specifically with ESOL in the past — finding people who are qualified and had a desire to do that,\" Jackson said. \"And that's a quarter of the positions we're looking for.\"\nZulieka Jarmon-Horsey, assistant superintendent of administrative services, systems and strategies, said it's a challenge both in Talbot County and statewide. She said recruitment and retention are key aspects.\n\"We have to definitely start promoting earlier and just doing the best that we can,\" Jarmon-Horsey said. \"And doing things that are unconventional, like our on-site career fair that's going to be happening here this week.\"\nOther requested positions in the budget include: an art teacher at Easton Middle, a high school math coach, a middle school reading coach, four special education positions at Easton Elementary and a special education teacher at Easton Middle.\nOne athletic trainer to serve Easton High School and St. Michaels Middle High School was also on the proposed list.\n\"I'm happy to see that at the top of the list,\" Jackson said of the athletic trainer role. \"I would be in favor of two … making sure that we have coverage for all of our athletic events. I know sports parents, they have eyes on that.\"\nThe draft budget will be discussed again at Wednesday's monthly Board of Education meeting before the board hosts its joint meeting with the Talbot County Council on Jan. 22. On Feb. 10, the board will host a public hearing on the budget. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed adds makeup day for snow; approves 2025-26 calendar\n\n January 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 580\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — During Wednesday's meeting, the Talbot County Board of Education added a day onto the end of this year's school calendar following last week's snowstorm.Talbot County Public Schools was closed Monday through Friday last week due to snow that blanketed the Mid-Shore. However, the 2024-2025 school calendar only had four inclement weather days built in, meaning an additional day was needed to comply with the state's 180-day requirement.\nHelga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, recommended that a day be added in June, moving the last day of school for students to Friday, June 13.\nThe last day for teachers would be Monday, June 16. Einhorn said that historically, most teachers complete mandated training that affords them with not having to come in on the last day.\nThe board unanimously passed the adjusted calendar for this year.\n2025-26 CALENDAROn Wednesday, the board also chose the district's calendar for the 2025-2026 school year.\nAt last month's meeting, Einhorn presented a draft calendar with two days off in March and a five-day spring break, which was the recommendation of the calendar committee. Board President Emily Jackson, however, expressed frustration there weren't multiple options posed.\nThis month, Einhorn returned with three draft calendars. The first was similar to what the board saw in December, with a four-day weekend in March and the shorter spring break. The second draft removed the off days in March and had an eight-day spring break.\nA third draft included both the March break and an eight-day spring break, pushing the last student day back to June 10, 2026.\nAll three drafts included the typical days off in November for Easton's Waterfowl Festival, as well as a winter break from Dec. 20, 2025, to Jan. 4, 2026.\n\"There is no calendar that we're going to create that is best for every single person,\" Jackson said.\nJackson said it's clear — based on previous polling and community input — that most families favor the extended spring break. Board Vice President Amy Dodson suggested the board move forward with the second or third calendars.\nBoard member Karla Wieland-Cherry said she preferred the first calendar with the shorter spring break.\n\"You're losing a lot of school time for eight days off for students,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"You're losing a lot of momentum. And plus you're concerned with providing day care. Not all employers are going to allow that. That's quite a long time to take off of work and find day care and so forth.\"\nShe added that not all families are looking for a longer spring break.\n\"My only concern is that if 59% of our students are at the poverty level, we're really talking about more of a smaller group who are really going to financially be able to afford an Easter holiday,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"… You really could possibly potentially be causing more hardship for something that's more an elitist type thing, quite honestly.\"\nJackson said while she agrees with Wieland-Cherry's point, she has \"to go with what the community is saying.\"\n\"We have asked again and again, and the majority of the respondents to any time we've asked this have said they like that spring break,\" Jackson said.\nFollowing board discussion, Jackson motioned for approval of the third calendar featuring two off days in March and five days for spring break. Her motion included an amendment to the calendar that the March days off serve as two of four inclement weather days for the district.\nBy a 6-1 vote, with only Wieland-Cherry voting against, the board approved the 2025-2026 school year calendar. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Currently, with carryover in funds from previous years, the estimated deficit is at $10.19 million.\n\"We've just got some difficult decisions to make as a district on how we're going to move forward with the current budget crisis that we're in,\" DCPS Superintendent Jymil Thompson said during a Dorchester County Board of Education budget work session Thursday.\nJodi Colman, district assistant superintendent of academics and student services, said the budget increases for fiscal year 2026 make it possible to keep the district's current staff in place.\n\"This would just be to basically maintain the programs that we have right now,\" she said about the draft budget. \"All of those increases were due to just keeping our staff that we have for the most part.\"\nThompson said \"a whole host of things\" has caused the deficit, mentioning fixed costs and unfunded mandates from the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state.\nBoard of Education Member Brandy Dawson Cumberland said that although the board likes a lot of what the Blueprint aims to do, there are \"certain unfunded mandates that are going to cut other things.\"\nThompson said the district is still waiting on exact numbers from the state and county. He said once they have those numbers, it is possible the deficit could be lower than $10.19 million.\n\"But I don't think that it will be higher than that,\" he said.\nSo far, the district has taken a number of actions to reduce the deficit, Thompson said. This includes:\nReducing some positions added with Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief fundingSending emails about non-essential spendingDeciding not to hire for vacated positionsReducing the central office custodian scheduleReducing student support monitorsMerging some job dutiesEliminating the education specialist position\n\"We did try to make some significant changes,\" Thompson said. \"And there's more that I didn't put up that we have done. But the reality is it's not enough.\"\nThe district is looking into more actions that can be taken to reduce the deficit. Some possible actions include revisiting who should have board vehicles, auditing and reducing the number of programs and platforms the district uses, revising overtime policies, sharing resources with the county and reducing staff.\n\"No one wants this one,\" Thompson said about reducing staff.\nWhile listing different \"cost containment options\" Thompson and board members made it clear that the district hasn't made any decisions yet, and is just looking at potential cost-cutting options.\n\"We are just at the beginning of starting to think about what things we can do to attack that number,\" Board of Education Vice President Talibah Chikwendu said.\n\"And that's why we really would like to have public input to know what the public feels are areas we should focus on if possible,\" Board President Sheri Hubbard said. \"Because we want to do what's best for kids, bottom line.\"\nThe Dorchester County Board of Education will host another budget work session on Feb. 13. It will also hold one in March. The district's proposed budget must be submitted to the county in June.\nBoard Member Chris Wheedleton said that if community members are able to do anything, they should talk with their representatives in Annapolis.\n\"Because we need their help,\" he said.\nThompson urged that this is the time to work together and not be divided.\n\"Because at the end of the day, we know that $10 million deficit that we're in, that's going to hurt the kids,\" he said. \"That's going to have a profound impact on how we can provide resources for our students.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore and the state legislature aim to tackle a $3 billion deficit.Hiram Burch, the local government research and analysis manager for the department, shared that local governments across the state will have to pick up around $144 million of the gaps in the fiscal year 2026 budget as proposed.\nIn Caroline and Talbot counties, projected local cost shifts are in the $700,000 range. Dorchester County is at $830,000, while Queen Anne's County leads the pack for the Mid-Shore at $970,000. Kent is the lowest of the five counties with a $300,000 projection.\nMany of those cost shifts come in the education realm, including teacher retirement funding.\nDel. Steven Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) questioned whether record education funding that the governor's office has touted was due to the governor's actions or the result of The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's funding plan for education passed under former Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\"The governor's saying we have record funding to education,\" Arentz said. \"And I'm wondering if that's mandated from The Blueprint.\"\n\"Most education funding is formula-based,\" Burch said. \"He's required to put that in.\"\nBurch said while Moore did provide some \"enhanced funding,\" most of the state aid is required by formulas in The Blueprint.\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) said she's hearing from constituents that they're concerned about special education funding amid around $200 million in proposed cuts to the state Developmental Disabilities Administration.\nBurch said that none of the state aid reductions will affect special education.\n\"There were reductions in collaborative learning that impacted the foundation program, the compensatory aid program (and) the English language learners program, but this reduction did not affect special education funding,\" Burch said.\n\"That is the one area that has been held harmless by his proposed reductions and postponing the implementation of The Blueprint,\" he added.\nAt the close of Friday's budgetary discussions, Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said the state is \"very willing to pass unfunded mandates down to the counties.\"\n\"What this means really for Eastern Shore citizens, is their tax rates, their rates on their property, are going up,\" Adams said, referencing increasing property assessments. And that's how we're unfortunately going to be funding Maryland.\"\n\"That's my raw take on it, and many of our members are very concerned,\" Adams said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore's proposed state budget for next year come as the state faces a near $3 billion deficit.\nWith the potential cuts on the horizon, Simmons wants parents and students to know they will be OK in 2026, but in the long term, he said, the cuts will add up.\n\"I don't want to spread fear and panic for anyone watching at home,\" Simmons said. \"Caroline County Public Schools is going to be OK in FY26. We would be a lot better OK if the promise of Blueprint was there and the reduction wasn't there.\"\nThe Blueprint, the state's education improvement and funding initiative through 2032, originally outlined an increase in teacher collaborative time, during which teachers are not in classes and can plan, grade or meet with students individually. But with adjustments made in the state's budget to combat the deficit, collaborative time will take a hit.\nOther Blueprint cuts will impact the district in the coming years as well, the superintendent said.\nFoundation funding, or the base level per pupil funding from the state, is expected to decrease by $868,273 in 2026, according to Simmons' presentation.\nCompensatory education is the fund for students in low-income areas allowing free or reduce lunch for students. In 2026, the proposed funding for compensatory education will decrease by $513,912.\nIn 2026 the proposed funding for multilingual learners, or students who speak languages other than English, decrease by $91,425.\nAlthough these funding declines are manageable, over time the numbers will grow, causing bigger problems, Simmons said.\nFoundation reductions are projected to be over $25.6 million in the next eight years. Compensatory education will see a more than $13.5 million decline, and multilingual learners will see a nearly $2.5 million decline. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot school leaders discuss immediate, long-term effects of Blueprint cuts\n\n February 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 494\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Budget cuts in The Blueprint for Maryland's Future could have a potential impact of $1.7 million to Talbot County Public Schools this fiscal year, district officials said Monday.That gap is the amount of additional local funding the district may need if the governor's current budget proposal is passed, Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said to Board of Education members during Monday's work session.\nShe added that the impacts may snowball over the next eight years to the tune of more than $30 million in reduced funding from the state.\n\"These are deep cuts that are being proposed,\" Jones said.\nGov. Wes Moore filed the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act last month, a bill that proposes drastic cuts to education funding amid a nearly $3 billion state budget deficit.\nIf passed, the most significant cut would be a reduction in the \"per-pupil foundation\" funding outlined in The Blueprint's original formulas. In fiscal year 2026, it would reduce Talbot County's funding by $685,000, according to district calculations.\nThat's more than a third of the projected $1.7 million gap created by state cuts this year, which also includes reductions in compensatory education and multilingual learners funding, a decrease in the state's share of nonpublic special education tuition costs, and a hike in how much pension costs districts are required to pick up.\nDistrict Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the cuts to foundation funding per pupil, along with the slashes to compensatory and multilingual education, stand out. Superintendents across the state are continuing to advocate against the proposals, she said.\n\"While this excellence in education bill overall is saving money, it's still not hitting the foundation,\" Pepukayi said. \"That's the main push in the advocacy.\"\nThe superintendent said it's been conveyed that districts are expected to go back to counties \"to make up those expenses.\"\n\"That's all well and good if you live in Montgomery County or Prince George's County,\" Board Vice President Amy Dodson said. \"That doesn't really help us out here.\"\nDuring the meeting, Jones provided what the cumulative reductions in funding to Talbot County will be if the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act passes as proposed. For fiscal years 2026 through 2033, $20 million would be stripped from what the current Blueprint formulas outline for per-student funding.\nAdditionally, $9 million in compensatory education aid and $2.9 million in multilingual learner aid could be slashed over the next eight years, she said.\nBoard President Emily Jackson suggested board members begin their own advocacy amid the looming cuts.\n\"If we could, as a board, come together and talk about how we could take a stand here, I think that would be good,\" Jackson said. \"I think that would be a good first step in that direction.\"\nDodson added on, asking if members of the community could speak up, too.\n\"Do we want to get people in the community to write letters about this at this point? They're chopping our funding majorly,\" Dodson said. \"It seems like people in the community should also speak up, if they're so inclined.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Board of Education approves FY2026 budget\n\n February 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 346\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot County Board of Education passed the district's fiscal year 2026 unrestricted budget during Wednesday's meeting.It comes in at $86 million, an $8.9 million increase compared to the district's unrestricted budget in fiscal year 2025. Significant increases include salary costs and fixed charges.\nTalbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said that $2 million is built out for 33 \"highly necessary,\" additional positions. The budget also accounts for $1.3 million in expected health insurance cost increases due to inflation and the new positions, she said.\nJones noted that while the unrestricted budget is $8.9 million higher than last year, the overall budget of $95.9 million — made up of restricted and unrestricted funds — is only up by $3.6 million. This is mostly due to a year-to-year decrease in federal grant funding.\n\"So it is not, in total, a significant increase,\" Jones said. \"There has been a significant shift from federal to … local.\"\nNext month, the district will present the budget to the Talbot County Council. The council will hold a public budget hearing in May.\nThe district will be asking the county for approximately $18.4 million in capital funding — $18.1 million for ongoing renovations at Chapel District Elementary School and $260,000 for new stadium lights at St. Michaels Middle High School.\nWednesday, Board of Education President Emily Jackson complimented Jones for her work during the budget process. She said she's comfortable with the budget while acknowledging that much is unknown in regards to the state's contributions.\n\"I will vote yes on the budget when it comes to that, because I feel like this is a very sound budget based in fact of what we do know,\" Jackson said.\nBoard Member Cynthia Jurrius said she appreciates that the budget aligns with the district's strategic goals.\n\"We do know we have some potential things down the road that may change the budget as far as what state funding we get (and) what changes may come down the road there,\" Jurrius said. \"But for what we know now, I think this is a good budget and a sound plan.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed discusses dress code, school uniforms\n\n February 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 527\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot County Board of Education held a discussion during its virtual meeting Wednesday, touching on dress code updates and the possibility of implementing school uniforms.District Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi shared a revision to the district's administrative regulations for dress code. Administrative regulations do not require board approval.\nUnder the dress code standards, wording that singled out specific clothing items, such as \"low rider pants\" and \"spaghetti straps,\" was removed. The dress code largely remained unchanged aside from a few strikethroughs.\nBoard Member Ann O'Connor asked why some of the language was removed. Pepukayi said there were discrepancies of students getting coded, particularly in regards to body shape and size.\n\"Some of our administrators feel like they spend a lot of their day chasing down specific, indicated things in dress code,\" Board President Emily Jackson said. \"And it becomes a barrier to creating a relationship. And we feel like we are policing tiny little infractions all day long.\"\nThe board president later added that when it comes to dress code, she's in favor of standards that promote \"the dignity, and value and worth of each student\" rather than rules that police \"individual items of clothing.\"\nBoard Member Deborah Bridges said the revision \"guts what we had intended it to be.\"\nO'Connor said while she wasn't on the board for past discussions regarding dress code policy, she doesn't see a need for spaghetti straps to be permitted. She then raised the topic of school uniforms.\n\"In fact, I know this is probably not the way to bring it up, but I'm in full favor of school uniforms,\" O'Connor said.\nShe said uniforms would put everyone \"on the same playing field\" and \"solve all problems.\" O'Connor asked for it to be put on the table as an option.\nPepukayi said the topic of school uniforms has been discussed since she joined the district in 2022. Rochelle Eisenberg, the board's attorney, said the board does have the power to require school uniforms.\n\"You can have a policy requiring school uniforms so long as you would be willing to purchase them for children whose families could not afford them,\" Eisenberg said.\n\"I'm not opposed to uniforms,\" Board Vice President Amy Dodson said. \"I actually went to a high school that required uniforms, and I personally loved them as a student because I didn't have to think about what I was going to wear.\"\n\"I know the kids aren't in favor of this at all, but it would solve many problems,\" O'Connor said.\nEisenberg suggested no matter how the board proceeds, it should procure sufficient community input.\nJackson, who has been on the board since 2018, said the discussion of school uniforms has come up under past superintendents. She suggested the board look at past data and outcomes.\n\"I was told that it was once tried and it was not widely adopted, and it was very hard to enforce,\" Jackson said. \"I think that was at one of our elementary schools.\"\nPepukayi said talking with administrators and advisory committees can be a \"starting point.\"\n\"I'll talk to team members who've been here to get some historical context,\" Pepukayi said. \" … And then with current groups that we have, we'll formulate some questions and get some information.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

At Mace's Lane, eighth grade reading proficiency increased 20.8% from the beginning of year assessment. It increased from 35.2% to 56%.\nAt North Dorchester Middle, eighth grade reading proficiency increased 1.1%, from 51.9% to 53%. At South Dorchester School, eighth grade reading proficiency increased 4%, from 64% to 68%.\nAberg said the test's national vendor reached out about Mace's Lane Middle's eighth grade scores because they were confused about the major increase.\n\"Students are only meant to grow at the eighth grade level by 4.5 percentage points,\" she said. \"We had students growing by crazy amounts.\"\nAberg said she thinks students didn't show \"what they're actually made of\" on the beginning of the year assessment.\n\"And I believe that is a much more accurate picture of our students,\" she said about the middle of the year scores.\nAt the end of the presentation, Board of Education Member Christine LaMonica said this generation of children is inquisitive. \"And they want to know the 'why,'\" she said. \"And if you can grasp them in on the 'why,' then they show you what they got.\"\nMentioning her own experience as a teacher, Board President Sheri Hubbard said the bottom line is kids have to feel it's important to show what they know.\n\"And no matter how hard teachers try, it's just hard,\" she said. \"And so we need everybody working together to impress upon the kids how important it is for them to show what they know.\"\nHubbard said it's about more than a test.\n\"Not just for the school system,\" she said. \"Who cares what we get on a test? But we have to give them the intrinsic gratification, help build that in kids so that they will want to do it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The officials decided on a post Labor Day start for the new school year.Tara Downes, assistant to the superintendent, came before the Caroline County Board of Education at the March 4 board meeting. A survey was sent out to parents and staff on what start of school day was preferred.\nAccording to the survey, pre Labor Day start of school calendar was preferred by staff and parents in Caroline County, but survey officials felt from conversations with parents that the post Labor Day calendar was preferred.\n\"What I have heard has not been this,\" Board Member Chrissy Bartz said. \"Some feedback I've received is that its not their preference.\"\nThe board members discussed what factors played into each calendar to make their decision. Teachers having a longer break was one of the deciding factors.\n\"I worry about our teachers coming back that early and have a full July of summer camp and kids in building,\" Bartz said. \"I think if we could give them a few more days and have that long weekend available for families, I am hearing families would prefer that.\"\nFor the 2025-26 school year calendar the first day of school is slated to be Tuesday, Sept. 2. Teachers will return to the building on Aug. 25 to begin planning for the new school year.\nColonel Richardson High School is set to hold graduation on May 27, 2026, and North Caroline High School is set to hold graduation on May 28, 2026.\nThe last day of school for students is June 17, and the last day for teachers is slated for the day after.\nThe county has three inclement weather days accounted for in the calendar for the new school year. In the 2024-25 school year calendar, there were four inclement weather days, and all four have been used to account for snow this winter.\n\"The board can always change the number of snow days that we build in,\" Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"The board always has the ability to take certain days that are not state required days, we just have appeal to the state.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Community school leaders in Talbot County aim to make a difference\n\n March 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 794\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In her third year as community school manager at Easton Elementary, Katie Fox's job is all about removing barriers for students in need and becoming a community resource.\"The premise of a community school is for you to be the community hub,\" Fox said of her role. \"So you serve as a resource for everyone.\"\nIt's a relatively new position in Talbot County Public Schools and across the state. In 2019, community schools were introduced as part of The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's initiative to fund and improve education.\nMore than 600 Maryland schools are community schools. Two are in Talbot County: Easton Elementary and Easton Middle. Those schools receive extra funds to create services for students and families in poverty.\nAs future funding remains up in the air this legislative session, Talbot County's two community schools are moving forward at two different stages of the process.\nLast school year, Easton Elementary came up with an implementation plan and goals. Those goals are to increase availability of healthy foods, provide mental health resources, raise enrichment by 15%, and add 100 students to the school's Choptank Community Health partnership, Fox said.\nFox, a longtime teacher before taking on her current role, said those needs become apparent.\n\"You could probably spot test any single classroom teacher. All of those things spike up,\" Fox said. \"Food insecurity, needing materials, clothing. All of that is prevalent in all of the spaces, especially post-pandemic.\"\nEaston Elementary is in its third year as a community school. Starting off, the school received state funding to hire Fox's position and a health care practitioner. In Year 3, it received \"per-pupil\" funding to begin providing specific services and resources.\nFox said the per-pupil funding has supported before- and after-school programs and Teddy Bear Fresh Produce boxes for family events, among other programs.\nEaston Middle, meanwhile, is in its first year. Community school facilitator Shelby Parks is spearheading a needs assessment that includes staff, family, student and community surveys.\nAt the middle school, Parks says mental health, food insecurity and transportation are focus areas.\n\"We can't offer too many after-school programs because we just don't have the transportation, and students are struggling,\" Parks said.\nFox noted that transportation to grocery stores for neighborhoods around Easton Elementary and Easton Middle is a challenge.\n\"We don't have a current grocery store that's within walking distance, so that's just something to consider,\" Fox said. \"If the family doesn't have their own personal transportation, it makes it more difficult to access any kind of healthy food outside of a few restaurants that are there.\"\nFUNDING UNCERTAINTY\nAttempting to close a nearly $3 billion state deficit, Gov. Wes Moore proposed a budget in January with significant cuts and freezes to education funding, including for community schools. Many education advocates pushed back.\nHis budget proposed freezing community school funding at next year's levels, potentially impacting the money provided to schools such as Easton Elementary in future years.\nBut last week, the House of Delegates amended some of Moore's education cuts by passing a refined Blueprint education bill. The House struck through his proposed pause to community school funding and sent the bill to the Senate chamber.\nKristen Tilghman, Blueprint implementation coordinator for Talbot County Public Schools, said the district is watching closely to see if community school funding is paused or affected in any way.\nThe district is \"going to move forward because our community clearly has a need,\" Tilghman added. Easton High, White Marsh Elementary and Tilghman Elementary are the district's schools next in line to become community schools. Job postings for community school program leaders are active for those three schools.\nTilghman said the state funding \"sets the stage\" for schools to create partnerships and assist families all over Talbot County.\n\"(It's) vital to the whole community, not just that particular school's community,\" she said.\n'HELPING ALL'\nTalbot school leaders emphasized that theme of not just helping the designated community schools but bettering the entire district.\nFor instance, Fox is involved in monthly food distributions for families across the district, not just Easton Elementary.\n\"Because we're a small county, I can do this heavy lift at Easton Elementary, but Easton Middle and High and Chapel (District Elementary) and Tilghman (Elementary) can benefit from some of the things that are happening,\" she said.\nAs Parks prepares to move EMS into the implementation phase next year, she's watching how Fox makes an impact at the elementary school.\n\"I'm excited that if Easton High comes on board, we can see trends between Easton Elementary, Easton Middle and Easton High, how it all flows, how we all work together,\" Parks said.\nThe concept of working together applies not just for every school in Talbot County, but for every student in each school. Fox said all students benefit from the community school resources and programs.\n\"You create something for one, it always ends up helping all,\" Fox said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Since January, the school district has reduced its estimated budget deficit, which is separate from the county's budget, from $10.19 million to $5.59 million. It is still looking for ways to further reduce the deficit.\nBoth the district and county — which gives a portion of its revenues to the district every year — have said state mandates regarding the Blueprint for Maryland's Future are affecting their budgets.\nDuring the council meeting, DCPS Superintendent Jymil Thompson and Board of Education member and Finance Chair Chris Wheedleton presented on the district's draft budget for fiscal year 2026, reiterating what was shared during a Board of Education budget work session in late February. Thompson said the district will be presenting more changes to the budget at another Board of Education budget work session on March 20.\nAfter the presentation, Detmer said $5 million of the district's deficit equates to a 15% increase in property tax rates.\n\"My question is how much do athletic programs cost?\" he asked. \"How much do school plays cost? How much does operating two high schools instead of one high school in the county, how much does that cost?\"\nBoard of Education Vice President Talibah Chikwendu, who was sitting in the audience at the meeting, stood up to answer Detmer's question. She said sending all the county's high schoolers to one high school would increase transportation costs, increase class sizes and hurt student achievement.\nChikwendu said the Blueprint, which is a state plan that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education, does not just increase starting teacher salaries, but it changes what makes a student eligible to graduate.\nShe said getting rid of extracurriculars like athletics, which are outlets for students, will increase the district's dropout rate.\n\"If we do not have graduates, we do not have good employees, we do not have homeowners, we do not have property taxes to spend,\" she said. \"Everything is connected largely to how well we educate our students.\"\nChikwendu said removing extracurriculars would affect school culture and climate.\n\"That's also part of what the state evaluates,\" she said. \"And if those things slide, so do then our ratings and so do then what the state provides to us.\"\nDetmer said he resents having to ask those questions.\n\"I resent the fact that a one-size-fits-not-us solution has been passed down,\" he said about the Blueprint. \"I would much rather be waiting for recommendations developed here for how to best serve our students.\"\nDetmer said he would like to have the county look into asking for a special dispensation so the district can follow a plan that is tailored to it.\n\"We've just heard that the big, nuclear solutions, for many reasons, aren't tenable,\" he said. \"We can't just close multiple schools.\"\nDetmer said the county needs to follow a plan for education improvement that is slower and more purposeful.\n\"We don't have the property tax base,\" he said.\nCouncil President Lenny Pfeffer said the council will be directing county staff to look at options to solve the deficit, including looking into getting a dispensation. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Schools struggle to bridge learning gaps, adapt to a new normal\n\n March 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Andrea Grabenstein agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 726\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Five years after COVID-19 upended classrooms, Mid-Shore school districts are still working to close learning gaps, combat chronic absenteeism and adapt to lasting changes in education. While academic performance is improving across Maryland, with more schools earning top ratings, districts continue to wrestle with pandemic-era challenges — particularly in student engagement, virtual learning access and social-emotional development.\"We continue to see some gaps in students' learning,\" said Queen Anne's County Public Schools Superintendent Patricia Saelens, emphasizing the district's focus on tutoring, academic intervention and social-emotional strategies. Yet chronic absenteeism remains high, with some counties reporting rates above 25%, and virtual learning remains a logistical hurdle due to disparities in technology access.\nDespite the challenges, local educators say students have proven resilient, with many now excelling in academics and careers. The post-pandemic education system may look different, but its impact on today's students will be felt for years to come.\nLEARNING GAPSMaryland's most recent education report indicated steady improvements in school performance, with 91 schools achieving five-star ratings in the 2023-24 school year, up from 85 the previous year. About 41% of schools statewide received a four- or five-star rating, marking a gradual increase. However, despite these gains, schools statewide still fell short of meeting annual targets in every category.\nTo address learning gaps, Queen Anne's County Public Schools have expanded tutoring services where funding is available. Additional intervention programs in reading and math aim to support struggling students. Saelens stressed the need for continued focus on social-emotional learning, ensuring that students feel connected and ready to learn.\nCHRONIC ABSENTEEISMOne of the most persistent challenges post-COVID is chronic absenteeism, according to state Department of Education data. While attendance rates have improved since the height of the pandemic, absenteeism remains above 25% across the Mid-Shore:\nQueen Anne's County: 22.9%Kent County: 26%Caroline County: 28%Talbot County: 28.5%Dorchester County: 38.3%\nMatt Evans, supervisor of Student Services in Queen Anne's County said their district was already experiencing a slight increase in chronic absenteeism prior to the pandemic; however, that rate significantly increased during COVID-19 school closures and peaked during the 2021-2022 school year. Since then, the chronic absenteeism rate is on a steady decline but not back to the pre-pandemic rates, Evans said.\nHome instruction numbers also were increasing prior to the pandemic, with the sharpest increase and peak during the 2020-2021 school year. After 2020-2021, the home instruction numbers significantly decreased and ultimately plateaued, although they are not back to the pre-pandemic numbers, he noted.\nStatewide, officials are working to reengage students but lingering effects of pandemic-related disruptions continue to impact attendance.\nVIRTUAL LEARNINGVirtual learning, once an emergency measure, remains a complex issue. While some districts have successfully integrated online instruction for inclement weather closures, Queen Anne's County faces challenges in fully adopting virtual learning due to technology and connectivity limitations.\n\"In the state of Maryland, virtual learning days must adhere to all the guidelines of MSDE,\" Saelens said. \"Not all QACPS students have a one-to-one device, and unfortunately, we still have pockets throughout the district where internet connectivity is challenging.\"\nAdditionally, some teachers struggle with reliable internet access, making a full-scale virtual learning model unfeasible.\nADOPTION AND INNOVATIONDespite the setbacks, educators see lasting benefits from the changes forced by the pandemic. Kent County Public Schools Superintendent Mary Boswell-McComas noted that five years is a significant portion of a student's educational journey.\n\"A fifth grader in 2020 is now well into their high school years. Elementary school students today don't remember the pandemic and wearing masks,\" she said.\nWhile routines have returned to pre-COVID norms, teachers and students have become more proficient with technology. Virtual instruction, once foreign, is now a tool used strategically during weather-related closures.\nFederal funding post-pandemic helped schools innovate, including the implementation of student support coaches in Kent County classrooms. These coaches allow teachers to work with students in smaller groups, providing targeted academic support and aiding in social-emotional development.\nA NEW CHAPTERAs districts continue to navigate post-COVID realities, educators emphasize resilience and adaptation. Students who graduated during the pandemic are now succeeding at competitive universities and in the workforce, proving that the disruptions, while significant, did not define their futures.\n\"The pandemic was a challenging and troubling time for all of us: in schools, in our communities and around the world,\" Kent County's Boswell-McComas said. \"As with so many challenges, we have come out of it stronger. We learned more about ourselves and have incorporated innovative techniques that are still in use today.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We're having budget meetings on a weekly basis. We're talking to our team consistently with the board. We're trying to make the best decision possible for Dorchester County Public Schools, and it's not easy.\"\nWhile giving a budget update at the meeting, Thompson said the district will be looking into reducing its staff by 12 to 24 positions. He said those layoffs could save the district between $900,000 and $1.8 million.\n\"There are no definitive positions that we have identified as of yet,\" he said. \"But we will be moving forward to doing that at our next meeting.\"\nThompson said the district has been in conversation with district principals, Dorchester Educators, Dorchester Educators Education Support Professionals and the Dorchester Administrators and Supervisors Association to discuss where those staff reductions could be made.\nThompson said the district wants to retain as many staff as possible and minimize the impact on teaching and learning.\n\"If we want to get from 23 to 15, we can't afford to lose teachers,\" he said about the district's state rating. \"We have to make sure that we keep our class sizes small and keep teachers at all costs. And we're trying to do what's best for everyone.\"\nThompson said the district is reviewing attrition rate trends. He said he believes the number of teachers who leave the district for retirement and other reasons at the end of the school year will help.\n\"And we may not have to reduce as many staff,\" he said. \"But we will have to reduce some staff.\"\nAlong with looking into staff reductions, Thompson said the district will be opening up negotiations with its staff representatives, which include Dorchester Educators, Dorchester Educators Education Support Professionals and the Dorchester Administrators and Supervisors Association.\n\"And the reason is because we cannot currently honor the step increases and the (cost of living adjustment),\" he said.\nThompson said the district could potentially save $3.5 million through these negotiations. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, that motion did not carry, as none of the other six board members seconded.\nBefore the failed motion, Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi shared results of a community survey with the board. Nearly 1,900 responses were recorded — 74% of those coming from parents, 15% from staff and 8% from students.\nOverall, around 49% opposed school uniforms, with 45% in favor and the remaining voting no opinion. Responses varied based on the grade level:\nElementary school: 49% in favor, 41% opposed.Middle school: 49% in favor, 42% opposed.High school: 44% in favor, 48% opposed.\nO'Connor said after one year of implementation, there could be a school shop with \"hand-me-down\" uniforms. She said purchasing uniforms wouldn't be \"an exorbitant expense.\"\nVice President Amy Dodson disagreed.\n\"If you have a family that is only making minimum wage, it's a significant expense,\" Dodson said. \"And you have a significant portion of our student population that is on free and reduced meals.\"\nBoard member Dyshekia Strawberry said she doesn't see the need to introduce uniforms since the survey didn't show \"an overwhelming response either way.\" President Emily Jackson concurred.\n\"I don't see an overwhelming need to make a major change in policy and procedure,\" Jackson said. \"Combined with the fact that, again, we are in a challenging budget year, and this would be an expensive undertaking should we go forward with it.\n\"Those two factors combined leave me not compelled to do anything in this regard.\"\nO'Connor said she was surprised by the high response rate. She told The Star Democrat she'd like the district to gather information on the impacts of uniforms at other schools and potentially revisit the topic next school year.\nIn an interview Friday, Pepukayi said she was surprised by both the high survey response rate and \"the closeness of the percentages that came out with elementary and middle\" school questions.\nThe superintendent said her team discussed the cost factors around having parents pay for uniforms, though they did not get into what specifics costs may be if the district assumed uniform payments.\nPepukayi said potentially helping families pay for school uniforms would bring up questions of which families the district helps and how that's determined.\n\"That's another discussion because then where do you draw the line?\" she said.\nPepukayi said she doesn't expect the topic of uniforms to come up again anytime soon.\n\"It didn't get the second (to) the motion, so it kind of died right there on the spot. But that's not to say it couldn't come up again,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

But county education officials say there is still time to improve grades for students who are at risk of having to repeat a grade.\"There is still time to pull it out,\" Dorchester County Board of Education President Sheri Hubbard said during a board meeting March 27. \"... Buckle down and work as hard as you can to get the grades to where they need to be so that you don't have to worry about there not being summer school.\"\nOn March 20, the district announced it would not be able to offer elementary and middle school summer sessions nor the high school credit recovery summer program in 2025 due to the district's need to adjust its programming.\nThe move does not affect the Extended School Year program for students receiving special education services nor the Summer Career Enrichment Program being offered in Talbot County.\n\"As we work to balance our budget for the upcoming fiscal year, we are having to realign our resources and adjust various programs,\" the announcement addressed to families said.\nCurrently, the district is facing a multi-million dollar deficit for fiscal year 2026.\nSince January, the district has reduced this deficit from $10.19 million to $5.59 million. During a Board of Education budget work session March 20, Superintendent Jymil Thompson said the district would next be looking into reducing its staff by 12 to 24 positions to save money. According the district, it currently has 859 total positions.\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR STUDENTSThe lack of summer school will mean if a student fails a course this school year, that student will not be able to make up the course this summer. The district wants parents to plan accordingly.\n\"If your student is failing a course, please reach out to the school to determine what can be done to help your child pass the course prior to the end of the school year so he/she does not risk being retained in the same grade level next year,\" the announcement said.\nDuring the Board of Education meeting March 27, Thompson said his suggestion to students is to take advantage of the time remaining in the school year \"to get the work done.\"\nHubbard said the board wishes the district could offer summer school this year.\n\"Of course we like to be able to offer summer school,\" she said. \"But in today's budget climate, it is not something that is foreseeable at this moment, so I do apologize.\"\nHubbard, who used to be a teacher, said teachers are generally willing to work with students who ask them if there is something they can do to bring up their grade.\n\"Whenever there was a student who came to me with sincerity and said, 'Is there something I can do? Can I please make up some work?' or whatever, we always came to some sort of way that that student was able to bring up their grades if they really wanted to,\" she said. \"It is possible.\"\nHubbard said the district doesn't want to have to hold students back.\n\"And we certainly don't want to keep anybody from graduating,\" she said. \"So just please, all of you work together and get it done.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Consultant David Lever with Educational Facilities Planning LLC was contracted with to begin the process.\nAccording to Simmons, the committee will help give the consultant a picture of what a middle school facility should look like to educate kids in the modern era and moving forward.\nThe architect will use the Education Specification Committee's documents to help design the school, whether renovating the current structure or building a new school altogether.\nCounty Administrator and Committee Member Katheleen Freeman says the committee will go through multiple different scenarios and specifications to make sure the middle school is correctly designed.\n\"We're going to look at the square footage that's needed for the facilities that would be needed in the school,\" Freeman said. \"Also the traffic flow. Can can students walk to the school? If they have to drive, what's the traffic impact going to be? Is it going to be easy for parents to drop off and pick up, and the buses and all of that kind of thing?\"\nThe committee consists of multiple school officials from schools in Caroline County and officials from the state, as well as community members.\n\"We have teachers from Lockerman, we have members of the Lockerman Association,\" Simmons said. \"We have central office folks who are involved with curriculum as well as building and facilities. We have parents at our elementary schools, as well as administration from Lockerman. We have some state representation that's been invited because the state will be a major funder.\"\nAt the Nov. 26, 2024, Caroline County Commissioners meeting, Bill Mengel, director of operations at Caroline County Public Schools, said the state is projected to be receive $76 million in requested funding from the state.\nMengel said the $76 million is around 89% of the total $86 million estimated for years one and two of the project. The county would be responsible for the remaining 11% of the funding.\nSimmons said the forming of the committee is a first step in what will be a long process to bring the middle school together.\n\"It is a marathon in terms of pulling this together,\" Simmons said. \"As we work through the process, we want to really keep an eye on respecting the past and preparing for the future for the needs for Lockerman.\n\"We want to make sure that it's done right, something the community can be proud of. It is also a responsible use of the funding that will be used to build it. We are really looking forward to the process.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Any additional funding for education included would potentially lead to a property tax increase for residents by way of an education supplement.\n\"Putting an additional property tax supplement on them this year specifically is a challenge,\" Haythe said. \" ... I just believe we have to be very conservative and think about the vulnerable population.\"\nVice President Pete Lesher was the council's lone member in favor of including additional educational funding in the county's initial budget proposal. Lesher said it's \"not prudent\" to push off the education funding to next year.\n\"It would make next year a lot more painful,\" Lesher said. \" … I'd rather do steady, incremental increases than take a year off and be hit with a much larger percentage increase a year down the road.\"\nLesher warned that holding off on fulfilling some of the district's requests could endanger recent county investments for new positions such as math coaches and social workers, since the district is under state pressure to meet $60,000 teacher salary minimums.\nTCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said Tuesday the district won't be able to continue funding all its priorities if the county only provides the minimum required funding.\n\"We will have to prioritize and we will have to make some tough decisions,\" Pepukayi said.\nCouncil members and county officials said Tuesday the option to fulfill some or all of the $5.7 million ask remains available in the coming weeks as the budget is amended. A budget proposal will officially be introduced April 15.\nLONG-TERM UNCERTAINTY\nWhile the county held off on promising additional education funding Tuesday, council members and school leaders found common ground during a joint meeting Monday, fielding concerns over the long-term sustainability of the state's Blueprint initiative.\nTalbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones touched on projections from the Department of Legislative Services released in February, which forecast significant increases for how much money counties are expected to provide school districts.\nThe report shows Talbot County is expected to contribute $90 million to schools in fiscal year 2034, up $35 million from what the council is planning to obligate for FY2026.\n\"That's a really sobering increase, but it's baked into the law,\" Jones said. \"I don't know what the council's view is on how you're going to be able to meet this contribution.\"\nJones said the DLS calculations, in part, are derived from The Blueprint's goals to improve teacher compensation and provide needed student support.\nHaythe said it's going to take time for the county to assess whether meeting those requirements is possible.\n\"We would have to come together as a council and really think through, get the details, work with (Finance Director Martha Sparks) to determine how we can get there, and if we can get there,\" she said.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said the state doesn't always offer financial solutions when it asks counties to fork over funding for The Blueprint. She said the state advising districts to ask counties to fill funding gaps isn't effective.\n\"That's not good government, that's not good planning, that's not good oversight,\" Jackson said. \"But I think that the people in this room can do all those things, good planning, good government, good foresight, good working together.\"\nAs for the looming $90 million mark, officials agreed it's going to take joint strategic planning and a lot of time to flesh out the path forward.\n\"'Can we get there?' is important to determine first before we figure out how,\" Jackson said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland wrestles with blow to the state schools budget\n\n April 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SASHA ALLEN Capital News Service | Section: Local News \n \n 733\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Maryland lawmakers are scrambling to figure out their education budget this spring after learning that $418 million they'd been expecting for public schools from the federal government may not come through.Senate President Bill Ferguson says the state had already spent approximately $300 million of the money and allocated the rest to school districts around the state when they learned that President Donald Trump's education department may not reimburse them as previously planned. The money was supposed to come from a special pandemic-era fund.\nThe funds are being spent by school districts to cover reading materials, after-school programming, and repairs for heating and air conditioning units, among other things.\nMid-Shore school districts were still unsure of the exact impacts to their budgets when asked for comment Thursday.\n\"At this time, we are waiting for details from MSDE (Maryland State Department of Education) regarding the final calculations and impact on funding for all Maryland school districts,\" Talbot County Public Schools said in a statement to the press. District officials said they expected to have more information by Monday, the final day of this year's state legislative session.\nSenate Democrats had already proposed cuts to the state's education plan, known as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. Now Republicans say it's even more important to make significant trims.\n\"We don't have an extra $300 million to spare, and it is foolish to double down on Blueprint spending when there are obvious accountability issues coupled with the concerns of our local school districts who are struggling to meet both the financial and the policy mandates,\" said Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Wicomico, Worcester).\nWord of the $418 million gap came late last week in a letter from U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, informing states that the fund's liquidation period would be coming to an end that day. Extensions of the pandemic-era fund, she said in the letter, were \"well past the period of performance\" and were \"not justified.\"\nThe letter specified that there may be exceptions on an individual basis, and Office of the Attorney General Spokesperson Jennifer Donelan said in a statement they are \"reviewing the matter and weighing our options.\"\n\"Protecting the state's schools and Maryland students is a top priority,\" read the statement.\nBut on Monday, Carozza introduced an amendment to the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, a bill aiming to reduce Blueprint funding, to pause implementation of the plan for the next two years.\n\"It's never been more clear that we need a pause in the Blueprint when it comes to affordability and implementation,\" Carozza said.\nTo balance the state's budget and bridge the structural deficit, the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act would make numerous cuts to the state's plan for hiking the investment in public education. While many Democrats still believe the Blueprint is necessary for the future of Maryland public schools, Republicans like Carozza are pushing for further cuts.\n\"There's no question that we've increased spending dramatically in education for the last 25 years, and our SAT scores are worse, our reading scores are worse, math is worse,\" said Sen. Justin Ready (R- Carroll, Frederick) on the Senate floor Tuesday. \"While we're not suggesting you want to cut education from where you are now, we are saying we should slow down how fast we're going and not raise taxes on working Marylanders for a little while longer.\"\nReady and numerous other Senate Republicans fought against tax increases in the budget bill, and many advocated instead to cut education even more.\nBut cuts have already been proposed. Senate amendments to the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act include pausing for four years the requirement for \"collaborative time,\" or the allocated period each day when teachers get for planning. The act would also maintain some reduction in funding for the Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports, a program providing mental health support in schools under the Blueprint.\nSome Senate Democrats, however, are in staunch disagreement with Republicans regarding the bill. Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George's, Anne Arundel) was the first to speak about the budget on the Senate floor Tuesday morning.\n\"We're not rolling over for the attacks on Maryland,\" Rosapepe said. \"We're protecting health care, we're protecting education, we're protecting public safety, we're protecting transportation … We're making the tax system more fair.\"\nLike Rosapepe, many senators mentioned the necessity of education funding. State Democrats pushed to protect funding for low-income students and English Language learners.\nThe Star Democrat Reporter Konner Metz contributed to this article. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Construction progress isn't quite at that mark, however.\n\"We'll be about 30% done at the end of the first phase in June,\" Shafer said during a meeting Monday. \"And the reason for that is a lot of front loading.\"\nThe renovation is a multimillion-dollar effort that includes around $27 million in county funding as well as state funds from Maryland's Interagency Commission on School Construction. Construction is being led by the Whiting-Turner Contracting Company.\nThe project is set to fully renovate the existing building and add around 16,000 square feet. There will be additional learning space for the school, as well as a Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers site located in the building.\nThe school's media center is moving to the center of the building, and the playground is also under renovation.\nConstruction, which began in summer 2024, is expected to take a couple years. The school was built in 1952 and last renovated in 1994.\nShafer noted the construction project started about 34 days late due to unforeseen septic system issues and permitting delays.\nHe credited Bill Stagg, the project manager appointed by the Talbot County Council, for preventing what could've been a significant delay.\n\"He was instrumental in making sure that this project even got started on time,\" Shafer said. \"If that would've hit about 40 days, it would've been pushed back a year.\"\nSchool operations have continued in the existing building this year during the first phase of work. Phase two of renovations will begin this summer once school ends, Shafer said.\n\"That is why you will see a front loading of expenses, making sure the supplies and equipment are here in place ready to hit the ground running,\" he said.\n\"That is a make-or-break time for this project. We have to be ready by the time kids come back in August.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

At the April 1 Board of Education meeting, district officials explored options for implementing virtual instruction should weather cause unexpected closures.\nBecause of the challenges presented by district officials, the board concluded it thinks the district will not be able to conduct virtual instruction on inclement weather days.\n\"The structure we tried to take with the presentation was a condensed version of some the requirements that the school system would have to meet if the county were to entertain virtual weather days,\" Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"We walked through some real tough spots for us to get to those points.\"\nInternet Connection and Google Meets\nThere are multiple factors Caroline County board of education most consider to conduct virtual inclement weather days. Including ensuring every student has a hotspot or wifi to participate in virtual learning.\nRobert Wielgosz, supervisor of technology, led the discussion on cellular service, offering points on the Kajeet program.\nKajeet was a hotspot used during the pandemic for students to connect to the internet in areas where wifi access was limited and not available.\nAccording to Wielgosz, when given the opportunity to use Kajeet, some students would use the hotspot for personal uses like video games and movies. This overloaded the hotspots and caused delays.\nThe estimate cost for Caroline County to provide the 700 needed Kajeet devices over five years would be about $736,000 for students and $35,000 for teachers.\nWielgosz also mentioned the need for Google Meet Breakout Rooms, which teachers use to conduct learning activities with groups in virtual classrooms. While this feature was available at no cost, it is no longer available in Caroline County's free Google plan.\n\"To get the feature back, it's going to cost Caroline County somewhere between $30,000 to $50,000 a year to get the premium Google aspect,\" Wielgosz said.\nMultilingual Learners, Special Education and Homelessness\nState law mandates districts \"ensure that all staff and students, including students with disabilities, homeless students, and English language learners, have the necessary devices at home for virtual education days, including access to Wifi.\"\nProviding equitable access to these services can be challenging during virtual instruction, district officials said.\nCaroline County has 576 multilingual learners, 569 individualized education program students and 116 students who experience homelessness. For these students, hands-on teacher engagement and preparation is required for proper learning.\n\"It's very hard to keep students engaged, especially for four hours of synchronous instruction,\" Erica McDonald, supervisor of special education, said. \"Without that in-person tangible motivating things that can keep them engaged during instruction, it can lead to increased frustration.\"\nProviding necessary technologies and translation services are also complicated by virtual instruction, the officials said.\nTeacher, staff negotiations\nSome district employees work on inclement weather days, and some staff members do not work and still get paid, district officials said.\nRequirements of the state say, \"during virtual inclement weather days the local school system shall offer public school employees who are not assigned to work during the virtual education day an opportunity to make up the lost work through other duties before the beginning of the next school year.\"\nThe district would be responsible for determining how this work would be made up.\nVirtual learning days require additional planning from teachers, which requires a negotiation with the teachers' union for proper pay.\n\"Our teachers work really hard. We all know are teachers work outside of hours. We have all come to accept that it comes with the job,\" Dr. Robert Willoughby, director of administrative services said. \"However, the law does say that we may negotiate with our teachers' union. They have a right to come to negotiate if there is extra work here we would like extra compensation for that.\"\nAfter going through the presentation, Simmons concluded it would be to hard for the county to pull off virtual inclement weather days.\n\"I don't see how as a county, with the resources we have right now, that this puts us in a great position to be able to hit all the marks to be able to pull this off effectively to meet all requirements,\" Simmons said. \n\n Copyright 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But now the project is facing an uncertain future following a notice from the U.S. Department of Education.\nIn a March 28 letter, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon announced effective the same day that the department would not be honoring extension requests for projects that were granted pandemic-era funds, such as the American Rescue Plan's Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief, or ESSER, program.\nThe move left the state with millions of dollars in funding at risk after it was previously granted an extension by the Biden administration.\nState Superintendent Carey Wright said in a press release that the rescinded reimbursements would put more than $400 million of Maryland schools' pandemic-era funding in jeopardy.\nAbout $305 million had already been spent and was awaiting reimbursement from the federal government, state officials said in March. About $112 million had not yet been paid out by the state, requiring school districts to halt ongoing work.\nAt a Board of Education meeting Wednesday, TCPS Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said the district isn't finding itself in a huge hole with regards to the reimbursement window unexpectedly closing.\nBut as far as the staff health center goes, the district is \"sort of dead in the water,\" she said.\nTCPS has paid $127,000 to Marathon for its work to date, Jones said. Remaining costs total to around $1.4 million.\n\"Those are costs that have not yet been spent, but we don't have authority to spend them,\" Jones said.\nJones told board members the district contacted Marathon, and the company quit work on the project.\nThe board agreed to revisit the question of funding the health center at a future meeting. Jones said there are multiple funding options at the district's disposal, including tapping into fund balance.\n\"We should really figure out how to make this work, and we should fund this,\" Board President Emily Jackson said.\nBoth Caroline County Public Schools and Dorchester County Public Schools have been fully reimbursed for all of their ESSER-related spending, according to school officials.\n\"We expended our funding within the timeline that was originally stated,\" CCPS Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"We considered (extending), but we did not end up needing it.\"\nSimmons and Dorchester County assistant superintendent Jodi Colman each said the March 28 letter did raise concerns for the status of federal funding in general.\nIn the letter, McMahon wrote the department \"will consider an extension to your liquidation period on an individual project-specific basis.\"\nWednesday, TCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi noted the state has submitted an extension request to the U.S. Department of Education.\nJones said she imagines there will have to be \"some allowances for costs that have actually been incurred\" made by the federal government.\n\"There are literally schools that are in the middle of some sort of construction, capital improvement, and you can't leave a gym half built,\" Jones said. \"You can't leave an HVAC system half-installed.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland State of Reading Report: 'time for a comeback after a decade of decline'\n\n April 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Andrea Grabenstein agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 469\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BALTIMORE — Maryland's schools are showing signs of progress in reading achievement, but a new report underscores that a deep and lasting crisis remains.The Maryland READS \"State of Reading in Maryland 2025: It's Time for a Comeback After a Decade of Decline\" report reveals that although incremental gains have been made among fourth-grade students, 67% still cannot read at a proficient level — a figure that mirrors the stagnation seen in eighth grade.\n\"We are still facing a reading crisis,\" said Trish Brennan-Gac, executive director of Maryland READS. \"Our state is dealing with a budget crisis, including unexpected federal education cuts. Equally concerning, our report shows far too many students are not able to read proficiently.\"\nBrennan-Gac's remarks come as state and local leaders attempt to reverse a long-term decline in literacy.\nMaryland READS is a nonprofit working to improve reading instruction in the state. The organization partners with government officials and community leaders to create better policies based on research it conducts.\nThe report, released amid a backdrop of rising education spending — up 37% to nearly $18,900 per pupil since 2013 — provides a snapshot of Maryland's progress compared with national trends. While the state has nudged ahead of some peers in its national ranking for fourth grade reading scores, nearly two thirds of children continue to struggle.\n\"Reading is an investment,\" Brennan-Gac said. \"Results will not come to fruition unless everyone works together.\"\nThe executive director stressed strong reading skills are critical not only for academic success, but for long-term outcomes like career readiness and reducing chronic absenteeism. \"If a child can't read, they feel stupid and don't want to come to school,\" Brennan-Gac said.\nBased on data provided by Maryland READS using the Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program reading scores to assess the health of reading instruction in individual districts, Mid-Shore learners fall below 50% proficiency in English Language Arts with the exception of students in Queen Anne's County.\nThe 2024 ELA Proficiency rates are:\nCaroline: 45.5%.\nDorchester: 33.7%.\nKent: 41.2%.\nQueen Anne's: 58.5%\nTalbot: 47.3%.\nState leaders have taken steps toward a solution by prioritizing teacher training and the development of literacy coaching programs. However, Brennan-Gac criticized recent legislation for \"missing the mark\" by not providing adequate funding for literacy coaches — a move she argues is essential for \"translating research-based practices into everyday classroom instruction.\"\nIn addition to bolstering teacher support, the report calls for a comprehensive, community-driven approach to literacy. It highlights a need for creating reading ecosystems that extend beyond the classroom and address factors such as excessive screen time — a growing barrier to the \"deep reading\" it says underpins comprehension and critical thinking.\n\"Over the last year, state leaders have led by taking action, but we need a comprehensive, community-driven effort,\" Brennan-Gac said. \"My hope is the legislator will look at his data and start to ask why and, next year, have a different mindset.\" \n\n Copyright 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "High school graduation rate reaches seven-year high\n\n April 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Erin Sjostedt Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 510\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland's high school graduation rate climbed to 88% in 2024, reaching its highest point since 2017, according to the Maryland State Department of Education. The increase of nearly 2 percentage points over the previous year marks a significant recovery following pandemic-era declines.The 2024 data from MSDE shows significant gains among student groups that have historically faced barriers to graduation. Hispanic students saw their graduation rate rise over seven percentage points, while multilingual learners experienced a dramatic increase of over 10%.\n\"Last year was the largest year-over-year gain of any student group, and I think that's a testimony to targeted, sustained supports that are making the difference,\" said Theresa Timmons Parrott, an MSDE official focused on multilingual education. \"It's a step in the right direction, but it's not the finish line.\"\nTalbot County boasted a graduation rate of 95%, seven points above the state average.\nCaroline and Dorchester counties both fell below the state average with rates of 87.5 and 84.4, respectively.\nStatewide, female students continued to graduate at higher rates than male students, and white and Asian students graduated at higher rates than their Black and Hispanic peers. Students with disabilities graduated at a rate of 69%, still well below the statewide average. Economically disadvantaged students' graduation rate increased slightly from 2023, graduating at a rate of 82%.\nThe graduation rate report comes as Maryland begins to implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a landmark education reform law that aims to expand early childhood education, increase college and career readiness and close equity gaps.\nSeveral of the strategies outlined in the Blueprint — including community school models and increased funding for English language learners — align with areas of progress highlighted in the 2024 data.\n\"If you dig down into the Blueprint, it really lays the foundation for the strategies we're seeing pay off,\" Parrott said. She attributes a large portion of the progress made to broaden access to early childhood education, target funding for multilingual learners, and mandate college and career readiness pathways by tenth grade.\nWhile the Blueprint for Maryland's Future has driven recent graduation gains, lawmakers enacted adjustments this year due to a projected $3 billion budget shortfall. The Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, passed in April 2025, includes a three-year delay in implementing teacher collaborative time and provisions to freeze increases in funding if state revenues significantly decline.\nStill, regional disparities persist. While some districts reported graduation rates above 90%, others, particularly in rural counties on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland, sit at 80% and below. Education advocates say these gaps underscore the need for continued investment and monitoring.\n\"This is great news for Maryland,\" State Superintendent of Schools Carey Wright said in a press release from MSDE. \"When we set high standards, deliver strong instruction, and invest in proven supports, our students show that they will exceed expectations.\"\nAs the 2025 graduating class enters its final year, educators and policymakers are cautiously optimistic. The latest data suggests that Maryland's post-pandemic recovery is underway, however state education officials say it will require long-term commitment to equity, funding and student support services to maintain. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's Talbot County's third center, following locations in Easton and St. Michaels.\nJudy Centers are funded by the state and are a focus of The Blueprint, Maryland's expansive initiative to fund education. Last October, the state awarded a grant to Tilghman Elementary School to create one.\nThe centers provide workshops, family support services, enrichment and learning activities, and more for children up to five years old, according to the Maryland Department of Education. They provide most services for free for families in the school district where a center is located.\n\"Learning begins long before a child enters the classroom,\" Talbot County Public Schools Judy Center Supervisor Amy Walstrum said Wednesday. \"It starts at birth.\"\n\"The earliest years are the most critical years, and the most influential people during those years are the child's first and most important teachers, who are their families,\" Walstrum added.\nJulian has 25 years of experience as a Judy Center coordinator in Maryland, including in Queen Anne's County and recently at the St. Michaels site. The new Tilghman Island Judy Center is paramount to providing local families with resources, Julian said.\n\"We had (Tilghman Island) families that were coming to our St. Michaels (site), and then due to funding, we had to tell them they couldn't come anymore,\" Julian said. \"So we lost half our families. So when we put in for this grant, we were blessed to get it here.\"\nJulian says in a way, the Tilghman Island community has been left behind and put at a disadvantage. The elementary school only has about 100 students, community resources are limited and families have to make 20-minute drives to get to a grocery store, she said.\nBut the Judy Center is a significant step toward closing that gap for local families.\n\"Because we're such a small school, we really were surprised when we did get the grant,\" Julian said. \"And the families were just thrilled.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The former would add to the district's multilingual and special education staff, while the latter aims to inch the district closer to state-mandated $60,000 teacher salary minimums by fiscal year 2027.\nDistrict leaders say it's a \"scaled-back\" request from its $5.7 million ask of the county earlier this budget cycle.\n\"We recognize the financial pressures you face,\" Board of Education President Emily Jackson said at a May 6 budget hearing. \"This ask is lean, deliberate and rooted in what's most necessary to keep moving forward.\"\nIn the county's budget already is $55 million for TCPS as required by The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's overarching education improvement framework.\nCouncil members are left to mull the best option as they prepare to vote on final amendments to the county's draft $161 million budget. So far, there's no clear decision.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher supported fulfilling the district's full $5.7 million request last month and maintained that stance for the pared down ask at a budget deliberation Tuesday.\n\"We're going to have to do it sooner or later,\" Lesher said. \"I think it makes sense to do it this year and reduce the pain next year.\"\nPresident Chuck Callahan said he feels comfortable with honoring the $600,000 part of the request to cover the new positions.\nCouncil members Keasha Haythe, Lynn Mielke and Dave Stepp have all indicated they need more time to consider options.\nAny additional funding granted would result in an education supplement to the property tax rate, which is 79 cents per $100 of assessed value.\nTalbot County is already mandated by the state to pay $440,000 for teachers' pensions, which will be collected through a supplement of less than half a cent per $100 of assessed value.\nThree potential scenarios for tax supplements have been laid out by county staff:\nTeachers' pensions only: 0.0045 per $100 of assessed value.\nTeachers' pensions and $500,000 for salary increases: 0.0096 per $100 of assessed value.\nTeachers' pensions and $600,000 for new positions: 0.0106 per $100 of assessed value.\nHaythe said Tuesday she's trying to balance helping the school system with preventing tax increases for residents on fixed income, such as seniors.\n\"I am in no way, shape or form trying to discount the great work that the school system does and what the teachers do in the classroom,\" Haythe said.\nAt last week's hearing, teachers and parents advocated for the council to include the $1.1 million. Lisa Hayes, a parent of three TCPS graduates, said past education investments are paying off now as her children enter the workforce.\n\"You cannot not fund a budget for our children's education because there is nothing more important than that,\" Hayes said.\nAndy Burke, president of the Talbot County Education Association, which functions as the teachers' union, made his case.\n\"We continue to see too many educators migrate away to the higher wages and salaries paid in neighboring public school systems,\" Burke said.\nIn an emailed statement, TCPS Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said the district made \"very difficult choices\" to reduce its request to the county.\nJones noted staff will present the Board of Education with a budget amendment package in June, which will adjust the $86 million unrestricted budget the board OK'd in February.\n\"We will eliminate most of the new positions we had requested,\" Jones wrote. \"We will scale back our requests and defer programs that will have the least direct impact on our goals for our students.\"\nA final decision by the county on the $1.1 million in question, as well as the entire FY26 budget, is expected at the council's May 27 meeting.\nWhile no clear choice was made during Tuesday's deliberations, county and district leaders did agree that state mandates and formulas are creating the tricky fiscal situation.\n\"It's just become screamingly clear that there's a disconnect at the state level between the requirements that they're putting on local schools across the state, and the funding formulas that are articulated to county governments to pay for their education,\" said County Manager Clay Stamp. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The potential middle school would sit on a 23-acre parcel.\nOn that parcel, there is a solar field area that architects would have to contend with. There is also a pasture connected to the Career Center that could impact school placement and design.\nCommunity members brought forward suggestions for what the county could do with the Lockerman location if it moved next to North Caroline High. They recommended students could share bus routes with high schoolers and made safety suggestions for both schools.\nThe Double Hills road site is located near the Caroline County Sheriffs Office and Caroline County Emergency Services buildings on 76 acres. The county owns the land, and the Lockerman Committee is looking for a 21-acre portion.\nKevin Shearon, engineer for the Lockerman project, brought attention to the size and distance of the road and made considerations for what they would do to the road to make it accessible for the school.\n\"Double Hills is a 20-21 foot road with no shoulders on either side,\" Shearon said. \"So, we would consider adding shoulders, at least on the school side or the site side for ACLD cell and just a wider feel for the right.\"\nAccording to Lockerman Committee members, the public water and sewer could be extended from the Denton's systems for the potential school.\nAfter explaining both new locations, Lockerman Committee members and Superintendent Derek Simmons answered questions from residents and heard their concerns and suggestions.\n\"It was great to see the turnout,\" Simmons said. \"It was great to see the engagement, folks are really passionate about their faults, which is great. Our architects and our consultants need that information now as we're working in the very early stages of design. I'm glad they came out.\n\"There will be another opportunity on June 2, and I hope the turnout is equally as good as not better. Because the board's got a big decision to make in July, and we want to provide them with the best information we can on the sites that we're considering.\"\nThe next public meeting on potential school locations will be held on June 2 at Lockerman Middle School at 6 p.m. Following that, the committee will have a presentation to the Board of Education on July 1 about their decision. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Addressing that deficit meant Dorchester County schools lost after-school and summer programming.\nThe cuts to education come at a time when the county ranks 21st out of 24 school districts (including Baltimore City) in third grade literacy and 22nd out of 24 in overall English Language Arts proficiency in the state.\nThe Y is partnering with the John and Janice Wyatt Foundation to create a space for the Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading, a campaign that aims to target childhood illiteracy.\n{span}The campaign was inspired by the movie \"Sentenced,\" which was produced and narrated by NBA champion Stephen Curry. The film explores the epidemic of childhood illiteracy and its lifelong impacts.{/span}\n\"Dorchester County has, for a long time, been ranked very low in the state of Maryland,\" said Matthew Peterson, executive director of the John and Janice Wyatt Foundation. \"And so interestingly, now concurrent to all the work that the Y is doing, that we're all doing together, Dorchester County Public Schools is undergoing a strategic plan to go from 21st, to 15.\"\nThe Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading plans to approach this goal from multiple angles and with multiple partnerships.\nBecause third grade is a pivotal marker for childhood learning development, the campaign's target population are children from birth to age 5, so they are better prepared to enter kindergarten, and are less likely to fall behind.\n\"So we're trying to grab moms as prenatal because we're gonna do infant groups, we're gonna do, you know, toddler groups, mommy and me groups, so we want to bring awareness at early childhood,\" said Tynice DeShields, director of mental health at the YMCA of Chesapeake.\nThe campaign's partners include county schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson, the Dorchester County Public Library, United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, Operation Pathways and volunteers from the community.\n\"There's a number of agencies we've been working with over the years. You know, as any organization, some were more engaged than others, and so bringing everybody on board, finding out where that alignment fits best, and then trying to leverage that, to do the best we can, is what we've always tried to have,\" Peterson said.\nThe reading hub will be a space that is open to the public and YMCA members alike.\n\"We're building this reading hub as a meeting place where we can have a resource center, we can have meetings with the community, we can have sessions with the parents to teach their kids how to read, how to look at letters and numbers, and not just throw a book in front of them,\" said Bryant Wittington, director of the Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading.\nPeterson, DeShields and Wittington are excited to engage with the community and hope to build a strong foundation of volunteers at the reading hub.\n\"We want to build that unity in the community,\" Wittington said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Both schools went through a two-year application process through MAEOE to be come Green School certified.\nAlthough directors for programs at the schools said the program was intense, they said the help they received from the community was surprising and made the process go much smoother.\n\"You have to work together, and we divided and conquered,\" said Julie Strange, pre-k teacher at and program coordinator for Green Schools at Denton Elementary. \"You have to contact people at the board office. You have to contact contact your cafeteria. You have to contact people I didn't even know did jobs.\n\"It's an intense process, but again, eye-opening how helpful everybody was and that there are people for everything.\"\nWithin that application for the program there are different subcategories for which the schools must show evidence they met the objective.\nThe application also comes with a curriculum that must be completed by the students, and the school must provide one example of outdoor or environmental instruction per grade level.\n\"Through our curriculum and standards, we're able to teach these kids sustainability practices and how to take care of the Earth, just learning about the Earth through those environmental literacy standards. It's one of my passions. I really enjoy doing it,\" said Zellie Kneller Kidigarden, a teacher and program director for Green Schools at Greensboro Elementary.\nThroughout the application process, the elementary schools have been able to produce multiple projects that help compost, save energy and grow fresh foods.\nOne project at Denton Elementary involves collecting breakfast bags in the morning after breakfast. According to Strange, the school lets third graders create boxes and put recycle signs on them to put in their classrooms to collect bags in the morning.\n\"Every day, we get breakfast in plastic bags per child, and our school is about 650 kids. So that's 650 bags that go in the trash every day,\" Strange said. \"The kids were so excited about it, and they did it... the kids are responsible for putting their bag in there when they're done their breakfast instead of throwing it in the trash.\"\nOne of the projects Greensboro Elementary conducts is planting in multiple gardens.\n\"We do strawberries, herbs in our garden tower and then we have our pollinator garden. Our Environmental Club also planted native plants everywhere in our swales. Before the end of the school year, we're going to plant native plants in our courtyard,\" Kneller said.\nKneller credits community partners for being helpful in their pursuit to becoming a green school.\nSome of the organizations Greensboro Elementary has partnered with are Pickering Creek Audubon Center, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Tuckahoe State Park, Wetlands on Wheels and many more.\n\"I'm so grateful that we're a community school because being a community school allows us to work with... stakeholders in the community, and we get wonderful things from all the members in the community,\" Kneller said.\nGreensboro Elementary has been a green school since 2021 and will go through a renewal next year. The school has been able to secure multiple grants that will lead to future projects, including tree planting and much more.\nBoth Kneller and Strange believe every school should be Green School certified.\n\"It's really, really, really important work and every school should be green school certified,\" Kneller said. \"It is life-changing for a lot of students and adults and I would say everyone because this is the planet that we live on and everyone needs to learn how to take care of it because we don't have anywhere else to go.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So, this building is going to stay. It's going to keep its history.\"\nThough it was never indicated as a preferred option, staying at the current site and renovating was left on the table at prior committee meetings and discussions on the new school.\nThe May meeting featured two potential locations for a new school, the first location would be behind North Caroline High School, and the second would be on Double Hills Road in Denton.\nAfter a public hearing at that meeting, the committee came back with models and options for the school at two potential new locations.\n\"There was a lot of feedback last time about the safety issue for buses coming and going, as well as parent drop off,\" Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"So, I think the architect did the best they could with the two existing locations that the county has told us to look at to kind of make them as usable as possible.\"\nThe presentation given Monday premiered three building layout options for the North Caroline High location and two options for the Double Hills Road location.\nThe North Caroline High design options included two plans for a two-story style building with wings separated by grade level. Though these designs for the building itself are identical, the building is located in different places on the lot in each design.\nOne option proposes relocating the North Caroline High baseball and softball fields to a different location. The other keeps the middle school on the left and everything belonging to the high school on the right side of the property.\nThe third design option would also involve relocating the fields and would also relocate the solar array on the site. The existing barn and fenced pasture would also be rebuilt in a new location.\nThis third option is a three-story building design, with each floor being a different grade level.\n\"The different locations on North Carolina High School was interesting,\" Simmons said. \"I think most of us in our heads ahead of time could envision it in one spot, but giving the flexibility of the options really opened up some some pathway.\"\nThe Double Hills Road location designs featured the two- and three-story options as at the North Caroline location.\nWhile both options propose that the solar panels currently at the site may need to be located another portion of the county property and that new pump station will need to be constructed, entrance options, building locations and parking locations are different.\n\"Double Hills Road with the new county road going in in that property does preserve a 20 plus acre plot for to use,\" Simmons said. \"It's good location but again it gives us that flexibility now to see what the buses would look like coming and going. What drop off would look like, what staff parking would look like because there's nowhere near enough staff parking here as well.\"\nNow that the Lockerman Middle School Committee has presented all options, the public will have until before June 9 to respond to an online survey with their comments.\nThe top ranked designs for both locations will be presented to the Caroline County Board of Education in July. Then the Board of Education will make a decision on a location no later than August to make sure the timeline for construction stays on track.\nTo participate in the survey, visit carolineschools.org/article/2241492.\n. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Foundation of HOPE's new building to expand middle school girls program\n\n June 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 559\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Since 2017, the Foundation of HOPE has grown into a beloved nonprofit in the Easton community, building bright futures for middle school girls. Soon, the foundation will have its own building.A project to create a dedicated Foundation of HOPE space on the corner of South Washington and South streets is moving along after the Easton Planning Commission approved its site plan Tuesday.\nFounder and President Keasha Haythe remembers comments made by the first girls she welcomed into the organization's after-school program eight years ago.\n\"They said, 'Ms. Keasha, are we going to have our own space?'\" recalled Haythe, who also serves on the Talbot County Council.\nA building wasn't always in the cards, Haythe said, but in 2020, she and the nonprofit's board realized a separate space could be beneficial. Since schools shut down, and that's where the program's classes took place, the program was put on hold during the pandemic.\n\"If something like this happens again, it would be better if we have our own space,\" Haythe said.\nFor nearly a decade, the foundation has brought on a cohort of sixth grade girls each spring to engage in programming on economic development, entrepreneurship and self-confidence. The girls are followed through high school, and some that are heading off to college receive scholarships.\nThe after-school program would typically take place in Easton Middle School. Most recently, Haythe's nonprofit added St. Michaels Middle School and 10 students to the cohort.\nNow, the Foundation of HOPE is planning its own 5,200-square-foot, two-story building. It's a $2.2 million project, with over $1.8 million already raised, Haythe said. Construction could begin as soon as September.\nOnce it opens, girls from Easton Middle would be within walking distance to attend the after-school program, and Haythe hopes for St. Michaels students to be bussed to Easton. Expansion will occur, too.\n\"I've had parents reach out from private schools as well,\" Haythe said. \"I do believe the building will allow us to open it up to those that may be home-schooled as well.\"\nPlanning Commission members complimented the design work done by the Foundation of HOPE and architect Crosby & Associates, saying it fit the commercial character of South Washington Street but didn't stick out too much from the residential homes on South Street.\n\"Fantastic job with this site design,\" said Vice Chair Michael Ports. \"It's a perfect transition to these two different areas. It's quite awesome.\"\nDuring discussion, some concerns about safety were raised, stemming from the South Washington and South streets vehicular intersection and the fact there aren't marked crosswalks.\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh said independent of the project, the town is aware of those safety concerns and is looking to improve the intersection for pedestrians, bicyclists and vehicles.\nWhile the nonprofit has obtained OKs from the Planning and Historic District Commissions, Haythe noted there are still steps left in the approval process, including permits.\nBut the building may soon be a reality for future cohorts of girls. Along with office space, Haythe envisions a reading room, fun area, cooking lessons and much more for the sixth graders. And it could help spark even more excitement from the students once they have a building to call the Foundation of HOPE home.\n\"For them to come to the classroom for the after-school program, it's asking a lot of them to stay in that building until we're done with our sessions,\" Haythe said. \"This will break that up.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He noted that during interviews, she indicated interest in owning her own business one day.\nThe apprenticeship comes at a time when he says the company is on a mission to get girls and young women involved in the construction and building industry and empower them to go after job opportunities in similar fields.\nOlde School Builders has recently partnered with Easton Middle School to run a Girls Who Build club. Postlewait said this past spring, the students who joined were hesitant at first but left feeling more confident and comfortable.\nOn June 16, Postlewait expressed excitement to welcome Escalante-Garcia on board for the summer and following school year. He said he wants people and young girls to gain that confidence in areas that may, at times, not be considered by most high schoolers.\n\"We're so happy to have her with us,\" Postlewait said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The board decided to push the decision back to the August meeting.\nMultiple reasons came forward on why the North Caroline High site was recommended over the Double Hills Road site.\n\"Some of the highlights that came out throughout the analysis and the surveys was again, the infrastructure. If you're not spending a lot of money on that, the site readiness, the educational alignment, a lot of really exciting ideas came out during the community meeting of ways that you could really have mentorships and things like that with the older and the younger students being on one site,\" said Robyn Toth, architect for the new school.\nReason included the use for indoor and outdoor activities and the ability to share space for events at North Caroline High.\n\"There's clear paths for the indoor and outdoor activities,\" Toth said. \"There's no crossing of streets, lots of capabilities there also because you are sharing more spaces… There were some concerns about large events and right now, if they're at Double Hills or if they're at Lockerman now, where do we go for these large events? That don't happen that often and you don't necessarily need to build more space that the state's not going to support. Well, you've got a high school right there that's got a large auditorium. It's got a large gym.\"\nWith the North Caroline High location, development prices will be about $500,000 cheaper. The site development for the North Caroline High location will be $10 million, while Double Hills Road would cost $10.5 million.\nAlthough in the community meetings multiple builds were shown, the new middle school, regardless of the location, will be a two-story building with a two-wing design.\nAccording to the Ed Specs Committee Powerpoint, the new anticipated project budget would be $103.82 million with state funding coming in at around $80 million and local funding covering the remainder.\nThe only concerns brought up about the North Caroline High site were the solar array on the property and the traffic Central Avenue could receive from a new school being added to the location.\nTo purchase the solar panels on the property, it would cost about $180,000, which doesn't include the cost of relocation.\nThe Board of Education will take all the information received and make a decision on what location will be picked at its August meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

To further reduce the deficit, DCPS got rid of their after school and summer programs.\nThe county had to reduce staff sizing, but Superintendent Jymil Thompson said he wants to keep class sizes small and retain teachers at all costs.\nThe Board of Education has been making concerted efforts to move DCPS from 23rd out of 24 school districts — including Baltimore City — in state education ranking, but the federal funding cuts make those efforts more difficult.\n\"Moving forward, we will be proactively looking closely at unique ways to reallocate pre-existing funds to support the inclusion of these federally funded programs which are a major asset to Dorchester County Public Schools and the enrichment of its students,\" O'Bier said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Board members agreed to get rid of the pouches, but they will likely come up with an alternative like locking student's personal devices in lockers or backpacks.\nThe board made a motion to pass the policy as a first read with the understanding that revisions will be made before the second read and final approval at the next meeting on Aug. 21 at 6 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Closing gaps': TCPS data shows some literacy, math improvements\n\n July 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 586\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Test score data from last school year is showing key math and English improvements for some Talbot County students, according to school officials.Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi presented data sets to the Board of Education last week. She's especially pleased with jumps for the district's Black and Hispanic students.\n\"We are closing gaps and moving the needle on the subgroups,\" Pepukayi said in an interview.\nSchool data from the Measures of Academic Progress, or MAP, testing program shows 68% of kindergarten students scored in the 50th percentile or above in math in the 2024-2025 school year. That's up from 54% the year prior.\nThe percent of students, sorted by grade, meeting or exceeding that 50th percentile for the math and ELA tests mostly increased across the board. Dips were seen for third and fifth graders in ELA performance.\nAnd in subgroups, there were many green arrows for Black and Hispanic students. For instance, both Black and Hispanic third graders saw a 31% year-to-year jump in testing at the 50th percentile mark or above in math, and a 21% year-to-year increase for that same mark in ELA.\n\"I'm really glad to see such improvement in the Latino and Black community. That's huge,\" said Board Member Deborah Bridges at the July 16 meeting.\nPepukayi attributes the hikes, in part, to improved curriculum and the dedication of Talbot County's teachers.\n\"I can't pinpoint to say that was it, but I think we're on the right track of students learning skills that are aligned to standards,\" Pepukayi said. \"And we're looking at students being proficient on standards versus just getting a grade.\"\nThe tests discussed at last week's board meeting included MAP testing and the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skill test. Statewide test scores typically are released in August or September.\nDIBELS scores weren't drastically different from the year prior. A higher percentage of rising first and third graders tested above the literacy benchmark in 2024-2025 than 2023-2024, but second graders above the benchmark dropped by 5%.\nIn the MAP testing, the percent of fifth graders meeting the 50th percentile for ELA dropped by 6.6%. That decrease was mirrored by ELA drops for fifth graders in the following subgroups: Hispanic students, students with disabilities, multilingual students and students on free and reduced meals.\nData also shows this year's incoming sixth-grade class performed 4.1% worse in ELA in fifth grade than they did in fourth grade.\n\"Fifth graders are the kids that didn't get to finish kindergarten because of COVID,\" noted Board Vice President Amy Dodson.\nPepukayi said the next step is to fix those trends by focusing on the elementary-to-middle transition. She said in an interview that TCPS is vying to fill open reading and math coach positions for the middle schools — roles that have been beneficial at the elementary schools.\n\"That's what we're working on,\" Pepukayi said. \"I would say that's probably the challenge, of getting our staff and finding the staff to really do the interventions needed in the middle-school levels.\"\nShe emphasized that schools are collecting data on a smaller, classroom scale in order to know what's working and what's not.\n\"While we still have work to do, I think we do have to celebrate the small wins,\" Pepukayi said.\nBoard President Emily Jackson thanked Pepukayi and administrators for diving deeper into the year-to-year trends.\n\"We have been asking for these kind of results for a long time,\" said Jackson, who's served on the board since 2018. \"And the way that you showed up with the full transparent picture of what is happening in our schools, I think is really important.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot, Kent see rise in student homelessness\n\n July 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 674\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — State numbers show youth homelessness on the rise in parts of the Eastern Shore. Local shelters aiding families and single parents are noticing similar trends.Data from the Maryland State Department of Education shows Kent and Talbot counties had the largest year-to-year increase, by percentage, of students experiencing homelessness.\nIn the 2022-2023 school year, Kent County reported 66 homeless students; in 2023-2024, it took a 55% jump to 102 students. Talbot County's increase rate was 39%; 233 students experienced homelessness in 2022-2023, and 324 students in 2023-2024.\nCounts for 2024-2025 haven't yet been released — the most recent data was published in February — but leaders of nonprofit shelters have been seeing the increases in recent months.\n\"We are definitely seeing an increase in calls for families needing shelter,\" said Julie Lowe, executive director of Talbot Interfaith Shelter.\nLast school year, Easton-based Talbot Interfaith housed 31 children, Lowe said. That's a \"steady increase,\" she noted, though the shelter is limited on how many families it can help due to high demand, requirements for shelter residents and bedroom sizes.\nJust three of Maryland's 24 districts saw a year-to-year drop in student homelessness, state data shows. The counts are collected as required by the federal McKinney-Vento Act, which ensures students experiencing homelessness receive an education.\nA reason for the increase in Kent County is that school staff are better trained to identify the students defined as homeless under the McKinney-Vento Act, according to Kent County Public Schools spokesperson Dan Divilio.\n\"Homelessness in Kent County looks different from the common perception of someone living on the street or in a car,\" Divilio wrote in an email. \"Unhoused students often still have a roof over their head at night, but it may belong to an extended family member or a family friend.\"\nDivilio added that in addition to free school meals and the efforts of social workers and counselors, the district maintains partnerships with local organizations that serve families and children in need.\nTalbot County Public Schools officials say the pandemic has played a role in the increased count.\n\"The number of students experiencing homelessness is generally a reflection of the current economic climate in the nation, state, and region,\" a statement from the district read. \"The increase from SY 22-23 to SY 23-24, which is evident in the data for nearly all Maryland School Districts, was largely due to economic challenges faced by many families following the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\nIn Talbot, around 7% of students are homeless under the McKinney-Vento report, per state enrollment data. Nearly 6% of Kent County's 1,700-plus students experienced homelessness.\nThose marks in other Eastern Shore districts like Dorchester (3.6%), Queen Anne's (2.9%) and Caroline (2.2%) are lower, but the need to help the youth still remains, nonprofit leaders say.\nStefanie Johnson, executive director of the Denton-based shelter His Hope Ministries, has seen an increase in families and single parents seeking assistance, too.\nThe McKinney-Vento data for Kent County doesn't come as a shock to her. And Divilio, the KCPS spokesperson, noted that the district's count for 2024-2025 is 108 children, including children enrolled K-12 and toddlers in the district's early learning programs.\n\"Absolutely a lot more calls coming to us from Kent County, so I'm not really surprised by that unfortunately,\" Johnson said.\nShelters on the Eastern Shore are moving to assist homeless youth, but helping that age range comes with its own unique set of obstacles.\nJohnson said a specific challenge in the 13- to 18-year-old range is that her shelter can't take on children without some sort of guardianship or family present.\n\"With that 18 to 25 (age range), it's a little easier to kind of help them navigate,\" Johnson said.\nLowe said the Talbot Interfaith Shelter serves many single parents — some of them with two or three kids. The shelter offers life skills and job readiness assistance, as well as a transitional program for people to begin paying partial rent before being able to graduate to full payments.\nBut with the murky affordability of rentals in the area, Lowe said it's not always easy for families to make that transition.\n\"Homelessness is a housing problem,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The site puts the new middle school right next to North Caroline High School, giving the county its second location with a middle school and high school on the same property.\nThe North Caroline High site will allow 15.52 acres of space for the build of Lockerman Middle. The exact location of the building on the site has not been determined yet.\nAt the previous Board of Education meeting in July, multiple reasons came forward on why the North Caroline High site was recommended over a Double Hills Road site that was also being considered.\n\"Some of the highlights that came out throughout the analysis and the surveys was, again, the infrastructure. If you're not spending a lot of money on that, the site readiness, the educational alignment, a lot of really exciting ideas came out during the community meeting of ways that you could really have mentorships and things like that with the older and the younger students being on one site,\" said Robyn Toth, architect for the new school, in July.\nReason included the ability to share space for events at North Caroline High.\n\"There's clear paths for the indoor and outdoor activities,\" Toth said. \"There's no crossing of streets, lots of capabilities there also because you are sharing more spaces… There were some concerns about large events and right now, if they're at Double Hills or if they're at Lockerman now, where do we go for these large events? That don't happen that often and you don't necessarily need to build more space that the state's not going to support. Well, you've got a high school right there that's got a large auditorium. .\"\nBill Mengel, director of operations for Caroline County Public Schools, said the only concern with the North Caroline High site is the solar array on the property. The county has been in conversation with Tesla to purchase the solar array. No official purchase has been made yet.\nTo purchase the solar panels on the property, it would cost about $180,000, which doesn't include the cost of relocation.\nBoard members said the decision on the location was a very early step in a marathon of decisions before the new school will be built. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot school officials discuss AI guidelines for students, teachers\n\n August 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 659\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot County school district leaders aren't only focusing on how to moderate student use of artificial intelligence — they're looking to teachers, too.New guidelines discussed at a Board of Education work session Monday encourage teachers and staff to use AI responsibly. But AI shouldn't be used as a replacement for lesson planning or decision-making, said Robin Werner, the district's director of teaching and learning.\n\"It should be enhancing our instruction, but human oversight is imperative,\" Werner said. \"We are not using it to replace any positions or staff members, but it is really a guiding tool that can help teachers.\"\nOn Monday, Werner presented an AI guidelines document to be observed this school year. While not a formal policy, the document lays out how the district's schools, teachers, staff and students should use AI.\nStaff are encouraged to be transparent, and Werner said students should be comfortable asking when they can use AI tools.\nAVOIDING THE 'GRAY AREA'\nA committee of Talbot County teachers and administrators began researching AI last fall and developed the guidelines this winter. They visited the district's middle and high schools this spring to consult with teachers.\n\"Our goal is to ensure that AI empowers students and staff while maintaining academic integrity, equity and human oversight,\" Werner told board members.\nBoard members on Monday weighed whether to rely solely on the guidelines or consider adopting official policy changes. Policies and administrative regulations must be approved by the board.\nTalbot County Public Schools' work to regulate AI comes as Werner said the State Department of Education is lagging behind other states in creating AI rules.\nTCPS academic integrity and plagiarism policies are tied to state rules, which hasn't been updated to include new AI provisions, Werner said. Revising Talbot's official policies before any state updates wouldn't be prudent, she said.\n\"My suggestion would be that we wait until the state updates their code of conduct, and then we could avoid having to update it more than once,\" Werner said.\nBut Board President Emily Jackson said that while she understands AI is ever-evolving, a policy could spell out the standards more clearly.\n\"If we don't have solid policy to lean back on … I find it gets stickier and into that gray area,\" Jackson said.\nBoard member Dyshekia Strawberry agreed, and recommended the board adopt an AI policy, even if broad in nature, as the district waits for clearer advice from the state.\n\"Just to set some safety standards, such as not uploading any confidential information,\" Strawberry said.\nJackson suggested the policy committee bring back an AI policy or administrative regulation to the board at a future date.\nSTUDENT RULES\nDespite not being an official policy, the guidelines highlight some specific rules that students and teachers should follow.\nAI is prohibited when used to plagiarize or bully, Werner said.\nWerner said the district will be piloting a rubric scaled from 0-4 this year for students. Teachers, if they wish, can notate certain assignments in one of the following categories:\n0, AI cannot be used.1, AI can support ideas and brainstorming. Disclosure statement on how it was used is required.2, AI can assist in editing but not creating new material. Disclosure statement and link to AI chats must be included when work is submitted.3, AI can complete a specific task approved by the teacher. AI chats must be disclosed, and AI-created content must be properly cited.4, AI can be fully used as a \"co-pilot\" with human oversight. AI chats must be disclosed, and AI-created content must be properly cited.\nWerner said staff appreciated the rubric, which was adapted from guidelines in North Carolina.\nThe district is encouraging that misuse of AI be \"teachable moments\" instead of automatic jumps to discipline, Werner said. That will give the students a \"clear understanding on how AI can be used to enhance their education, not replace it,\" she said.\nThis year, members of Talbot's AI committee will be visiting elementary schools. Werner said it's \"imperative\" to stay on top of the issue and provide the best guidance to the district's youngest learners. \n\n © Copyright 2025",

Talbot County Public Schools Director of Operations Kevin Shafer updated the Board of Education on the project at a work session on Monday.\n\"We did squeeze a lot of work into a very small amount of time, which was a bit risky,\" Shafer said. \"But the team has pulled it together, and things look fairly good.\"\nAs crews worked inside and around the building, teacher and staff moved in for the school year earlier this week.\n\"Staff returned today and it was very smooth according to (Principal Kari) Clow,\" Shafer said Monday.\nThe renovation is a multimillion-dollar effort that includes around $27 million in county funding as well as state funds from Maryland's Interagency Commission on School Construction. Construction is led by the Whiting-Turner Contracting Company.\nThe project is fully renovating the existing building, adding around 16,000 square feet. The Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers site located in the building was redone as part of phase one. Construction is expected to finish in 2026.\nChapel District Elementary is one of five elementary schools in the district. It was built in 1952 and last renovated in 1994.\nShafer acknowledged a few concessions had to be made in order for the school to welcome students back in time. Some hallway flooring hasn't been replaced, but he said it will still be safe in the meantime.\nThe school's gym won't be ready on the first day, either. It should reopen by the end of September, Shafer said. For now, PE will be held outside or in select classrooms.\nFurniture for the first two phases arrived on time, Shafer said. The district had to rework its furniture plan, placing orders this spring before tariffs took effect and drove up prices, Shafer told board members at previous meetings.\nFurniture for the third phase was ordered at the same time and is being kept in warehouses by the supplier at no cost to the district, Shafer said.\nDrivers passing the elementary school on Cordova Road will likely see significant construction work obstructing the front of the building. That's the third phase of construction, which includes renovations to the administrative offices and some classrooms. A new media center is also being added to the school.\nA temporary front office is located at the back of the building where the Critchlow Adkins Children's Center is located, according to a recent school newsletter. Parking will remain limited during construction.\n\"By the time students come next week, everything should be in good order,\" Shafer said on Monday.\nOn Thursday, Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi shouted out Chapel District Elementary administrators, teachers and staff.\n\"They are going to be teaching through the sounds of loud noises, construction, dust,\" Pepukayi said. \"They packed up their rooms at the end of the year. They just unpacked their rooms this year. And they are still managing to assemble classrooms to be ready for our students to walk through the door on Monday.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Pepukayi asked everyone to remember why they got into education — for the students.\n\"I want us to remember this feeling when we're happy, we have smiling faces, and we see our students,\" Pepukayi said. \"Because we all know what happens, the rollercoaster of education.\"\n\"It'll go up and down, it'll ebb and flow,\" she added. \"But remember your why.\"\nChildren return to the classroom on Monday for the first day of school. Before teachers get into the full swing, Pepukayi unveiled new district initiatives to staff.\nOne is what she called a \"community bus.\" Decked out with school logos, it will go around the community providing clothes, food and other needs to families, Pepukayi said.\nShe updated staff on two other items. The staff health center in Easton is under construction and expected to open sometimes this fall. District officials have had to overcome delayed construction work on the project this spring due to a federal reimbursement snag.\nMeanwhile, a new early learning center for kids up to 5 years old is in the works for White Marsh Elementary School in Trappe, Pepukayi said. This spring, Tilghman Elementary School opened its Judy Center, joining Easton and St. Michaels.\nGiovanni Wynn, family service coordinator at the St. Michaels site, delivered a speech on the importance of early learning and her excitement for White Marsh Elementary to join the district's other Judy Centers.\nWynn, the 2025-26 Talbot Support Staff of the Year, and Easton High School band director Lauren Rose, the Teacher of the Year, each were presented with new cars from Hertrich Chevy Buick GMC of Easton and General Manager Pat Papineau.\nOther awards were presented on Thursday, including the J. Sam Meek Unsung Hero Award. Pepukayi spoke on the impact of the two winners: Kristen Tilghman, former Blueprint implementation coordinator, and Michelle Ringgold, administrative assistant of curriculum.\nTilghman, now assistant principal at Easton High School, spent three years as the district's point person in carrying out The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's expansive education reform package.\n\"When I first came on board, the Blueprint was alive and kicking, and I had no idea what it was about,\" Pepukayi said. \"... She helped me tremendously in navigating through the Blueprint.\"\nRinggold has juggled a large budget, supporting field trips and arranging tutors to go to classrooms in her role at the Talbot County Education Center, Pepukayi said.\n\"When I walk in, no matter what day, no matter what challenge she's been through, there's always a smile on her face,\" Pepukayi said of Ringgold. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Students' devices must remain off and stored. Consequences will vary case by case, but violations may lead to confiscation and discipline, with severe penalties for recording or sharing inappropriate content.\n\"I recognized that there probably will be a learning curve for students and parents with this policy,\" board President Sheri Hubbard said during the Aug. 21 meeting.\nHubbard shared that during her time at the National School Board Convention, she attended a presentation from a high schooler who said not having her phone during lunch has made her class closer because they truly talk to one another now.\n\"And students, I just wanted to give you that little glimmer of hope, that all is not lost,\" Hubbard said. \"Your life will not end because your cell phone is in the locker.\"\nPeter Singleton, who has been working within Dorchester schools for 53 years, urged the board to vote in favor of the harsher policy. He said he's seen the negative effects of students being on their phone during class or walking down the hallway.\nWhen the board passed the policy, Singleton quietly said, \"Thank you, thank you, thank you, God.\"\nBoard members did not make this decision hastily. A majority of the members acknowledged the 115 comments they received from the public, wanting commenters to know their responses did not go unread or unheard.\n\"I want to make it clear, I read every single one of them. And I want that message out there to the public because there were a lot of people who responded with copies of their own research, and I've done a bunch of research as well as we've shared among the board, and I see the different perspectives on it, and I was really pleased to see, number one, that many people responded and two, with very real impact to them,\" board member Chris Wheedleton said.\nThe responses showed 38 responders were for the new policy, 59 said yes with some suggestions, and seven people opposed it, Wheedleton said. He said the remaining individuals had questions surrounding some of the policy's language, which Dorchester Assistant Superintendent Michael Collins said the board addressed in this iteration of the policy.\n\"They need to learn how we converse with each other,\" Singleton said after the meeting. \"That's what life's all about.\"\nThe new policy will be in effect for this upcoming school year, which starts Sept. 2. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "State test scores: Mid-Shore school districts see mixed results\n\n August 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Maryland Department of Education released English and math test scores Aug. 26, revealing a major jump for one Mid-Shore school district and mixed results for others.Test results from the 2024-2025 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program, or MCAP, show that statewide, students made slight gains in both subjects. English proficiency is at 50.8%, up from 48.4% the previous year. Math proficiency is at 26.5%, up from 24.1% last year.\nThe Mid-Shore's five counties — Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot — didn't always follow those state trends.\nIn English, Dorchester County outpaced all other counties in year-to-year gains. Dorchester's English proficiency saw the largest increase statewide — up 7.6% to a 41.3% proficiency rate, which ranks Dorchester 19th of 24 districts.\nDorchester Superintendent Jymil Thompson said in a press release that the improvement is a sign the district's work to climb the state rankings is paying off.\n\"These results show that belief leads to action — and action leads to results,\" Thompson said. \" ... Today, we can proudly say Dorchester is on the rise.\"\nCaroline tied for the fifth highest year-to-year improvement in English proficiency at 3.5%. The district's new English proficiency rate of 49% now ranks it 14th in the state.\nMeanwhile, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties were three of only four districts in Maryland with lower English proficiency rates than last year.\nQueen Anne's is still above the state average at 57% proficient, ranking ninth despite a 1.5% drop. Kent dropped 0.5% to 40.7% proficiency, ranking the district 20th statewide.\nTalbot is 16th in the state with a 45.4% proficiency rate after a 1.9% year-to-year decrease, the largest decrease in the state. In a statement, Talbot County Public Schools Director of Communications Debbie Gardner said the district is in the process of analyzing MCAP data and will make a presentation to the Board of Education in September.\nPROGRESS IN MATH\nAll 23 counties and Baltimore City are seeing progress in math. No district decreased in its math score from 2023-2024, and over a quarter of Maryland students are proficient in the subject.\nDorchester, again, saw the biggest hike of the Mid-Shore counties at 4.1%. The county is still just 20th statewide at 16.4% proficient. Kent follows at 21st with a 16.3% rate, up 3.7% from last year.\nKent County Superintendent Mary Boswell-McComas said in a statement that the district has worked on professionally developing school principals in math.\n\"We're seeing the payoff in how our principals coached teachers in developing students' mathematical reasoning and how our teachers incorporated that in their classrooms,\" the statement read.\nQueen Anne's remains the Mid-Shore county most proficient in math at 31.6%, a 2.9% hike from one year ago. The district ranks eighth in the state.\nCaroline jumped 2.5% to hit 22.2% proficiency, which ranks the district 15th.\nCaroline Superintendent Derek Simmons wrote in a statement that he's \"very encouraged\" to see the district's growth rate outpace the state's.\n\"Our sustained focus on what matters, and consistency around evidence-based approaches will continue our growth,\" Simmons wrote.\nTalbot math proficiency remained almost even, going up 0.6% to 18.9% this year. The district ranks 18th in proficiency. Only two other districts had year-to-year changes worse than Talbot.\nUP AND DOWN IN SCIENCE\nProficiency rates from the fifth and eighth grade science tests show Queen Anne's schools are well above the rest of the five Mid-Shore counties. In fifth grade, Queen Anne's is 10th of 24 districts with 29.3% proficiency, according to data on the Maryland Report Card.\nBut Talbot saw the state's second-highest yearly increase, climbing 5.9% to 22.8% and 15th overall.\nKent comes in at 16th in fifth grade science at 20.9%. Caroline is 18th with 19% and Dorchester is 20th with 17.4%.\nIn eighth grade science, Queen Anne's lost its first-place ranking from last year as other districts made significant jumps. But the county is still third in the state at 44.3%, down slightly from last year.\nCaroline's eighth graders were 16th in the state at 23.8%, a 4.5% jump. Dorchester increased by 4.6% to 19.9% proficiency, landing it at 18th.\nTalbot tied with Queen Anne's for the worst year-to-year change at -0.8%. It is ranked 19th now with 19.3% of eighth graders proficient on the science test.\nKent comes in at 16.8% proficiency, up from 13.4% last year.ENGLISH SCORES \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Students carry locked pouches during the entire school day, with their phones inside and not accessible.\nEach student has their own pouch, which travels with them daily from home to school. Phones are locked into the pouches at the beginning of the school day and unlocked at the end using a magnetic device. If a student leaves the pouch at home, they put their phone in the school office for the day.\nAccording to CCPS, year one of the pilot program was a success.\n\"We saw it was a good first year with it,\" said Caroline County Superintendent Derek Simmons.\n\"The recommendation ... the board accepted was to give it another year at our middle schools. One year does not mean a trend. We saw good good results, but we want to track it for another year before we make any determinations about if we were to move it forward to the high school level.\"\nThe cellphone pouches were created by the company Yondr and were tested in both Caroline County middle schools last school year.\nDuring the June Caroline County Board of Education meeting, district staff presented statistics for the school year. Compared to the year prior, CCPS saw 30.6% fewer referrals last school year, with 130 fewer attacks, threats or fights and about 200 fewer instances of disrespect and disruptions.\nAccording to Simmons, student and parents have been receptive of the cellphone pouches.\n\"Last year it was minimal resistance,\" Simmons said. \"You bring in something new, people are going to have some concern. They ask questions, administrators at the building level handle the questions really well. By and large, everything went well with compliance. It's funny, we've had hardly any asks this year going in the middle because it just has become the expectation.\"\nAfter one more school year at the middle school level, CCPS will revisit the topic and potentially incorporate the cellphone pouches to the high school level. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester schools climb in state rankings after first year of ambitious reform plan\n\n August 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 509\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last year, Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson set out on a mission to change the school district's current ranking of 23rd out of 24 in the overall Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program evaluations. A year later, the results are in, and they look promising.The \"23, no more\" initiative is a three-year plan to move DCPS from the 23rd spot to 15th. Testing data released by the state this week shows the county has successfully moved up two spots overall, and it improved from 23rd to 19th in English Learning Arts proficiency.\nWhile DCPS' climb in the rankings may not be massive, district leaders say it shows notable progress.\n\"So we looked at the numbers as to what it would take for us to get to the middle of the pack, and we said, 'Okay, 15. If we move this amount of kids every year, we can at least get to 15. And then if we go higher than 15, that will be just added bonus,'\" Thompson said.\nThe superintendent said key strategies to get to 15 include setting a clear vision, conducting quarterly walkthroughs, focusing on instruction, rallying the team around a goal, supporting teachers, differentiating learning, simplifying processes and putting structures and systems in place.\nThe district's strategic plan, called \"Believe in Us,\" guides these efforts and emphasizes core values such as joy, putting children first and accountability. This plan has four key priorities: advance academics, optimize operations, pursue partnerships and cultivate conversations.\nFor Thompson, it is crucial that the community outside of the school system is involved in this process for it to work.\n\"I think that education is a community issue because I don't think there will be one person that would say that they don't want kids to be educated,\" Thompson said. \"That's the emphasis, that's the nucleus, right there. Everyone wants kids to be educated, so it's everyone's responsibility to ensure that the kids are being educated, not just the school system.\"\nThompson hopes the school system can act as a catalyst for countywide transformation through incremental progress and innovation.\nEfforts are underway to recruit more certified teachers and administrators to improve the attractiveness of Dorchester County Public Schools to parents and families in the area.\nThough these early results are promising, Thompson knows there will still be challenges to accomplish his ambitious goal. He said these do not deter him. \"There's no challenges that I don't think we can overcome as a district and community working collectively together that can be a hindrance for us to move to 15,\" he said.\nAs long as community members are willing to come up with creative solutions, Thompson firmly believes that there is no challenge they won't be able to overcome.\n\"We're not turning anybody away and we want everyone to be involved in the process because I think at the end of the three year journey, I think people will be happy about our progress as a school system,\" Thompson said. \"But I don't want them to be happy as innocent bystanders. I want them to be happy as active participants in the process.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Through these partnerships, the Judy Centers are able to provide a full range of early intervention and comprehensive services within the school and center.\"\nThe center offers multiple avenues of help and learning for Federalsburg residents ages 5 and younger.\n\"When we talk about working with those families and children, we offer play groups and our services always have a parent and a child component,\" said Heather Harding, Federalsburg Judy Center Early Learning Hub coordinator. \"It's always a family caregiver and the child together. So we offer play groups throughout the week, we offer family engagements, we offer parent training and that may take on different forms… We service the whole family so it's whatever the family determines their needs are, and it is a strength-based program.\"\nThe celebration of 25 years featured an event with activities for children and families. The Judy Center created a timeline walkthrough for the last 25 years and invited all previous employees from the 25 years to participate.\n\"It was really important for us that when we plan the celebration that we took it back to the focus of the Judy Center work, which is family,\" Elizabeth Saylor, supervisor of instruction, said.\n\"So, we did a big family event, so the kids had something fun to do, and the families had something fun to do, and then we did all those the traditional ceremonial things too…We invited all previous employees to come back as well. So, it truly was as current families, family families, but then definitely our work family as well.\"\nStaff said the impact was the best reward for all the hard work.\n\"I absolutely love my job with the Judy Center, and I was here previously, when we also worked as an Early Head Start under the direction of Ms. Tearesa French,\" Harding said. \"She was the supervisor for 22 years of it. The impact that the work has made on everyone, it was never just one person. It's always been a collective. It's always been at the helm of Caroline County Public Schools, and just all the things that we were able to do to serve children and families has just been wonderful.\"\nTo learn more about the Judy Center, visit carolineschools.org/page/early-learning. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

FY27 shows the county allocating about $1.4 million, FY28 shows $8.1 million and FY29 shows $15.5 million.\nThese numbers are large, but Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said he expects the county allocation to be lowered over time because of state funding.\nSimmons said the numbers shown on the capital improvement plan for county allocations were determined based on what was needed to cover projected costs above what the state had allocated to the project.\nThe state and the county will then go back and forth on what the county actually needs based on research of student population and other factors. Simmons said the hope is that through this process, they will be able to get the county allocation amount down.\n\"We will spend the next several months, possibly a year, going back and forth justifying our ask and then them hopefully changing their stance and meeting somewhere in the middle,\" Simmons said. \"But what this represents is anything that we ask for above what the state is saying we need, it becomes 100% local cost.\"\nThe Board of Education approved the capital improvement program Sept. 2. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But since, the national trend shows girls declining in these areas at a faster rate than boys. Mid-Shore school districts were no exception.\nBut when Lily reached out to local districts to ask why this decline was happening and how they were responding, only one district responded.\nSo, after two weeks of pushing district representatives for answers, Lily switched her focus. She leaned into the numbers and contacted a statewide group focused on youth STEM programming to round out her story, which you can find below.\nThanks, as always, for reading.\n— Wendy Weitzel \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Girls lose gains in math and science post-pandemic\n\n September 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Headlines \n \n 894\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recent data from the Stanford Education Data Archive and the National Center for Education Statistics revealed that girls were making major gains in subjects like math and science before the pandemic. Since, the national trend shows girls declining in these areas at a faster rate than boys.Maryland experienced one of the largest drops in girls' math scores compared with boys'. Between 2019 and 2024, girls fell behind, on average, the equivalent of 49% of a grade level more than boys, according to data analysis from The Associated Press.\n\"There's a lot of cyclical things happening in education,\" Maryland's 4-H STEM specialist Mark DeMorra said. \"It's kind of like a pendulum in the fact that we swung so far to one side.\"\nGirls on Maryland's Eastern Shore were no exception to the decline in math skills. Talbot, Caroline and Dorchester County all followed this trend, but some districts stood out more than others.\nThe study compared 2023 National Assessment of Educational Progress test results to the 2019 national average. The results represented grade levels three through eight. A score of 5.5 is equivalent to the national average in 2019. Each whole point represents the equivalent of a grade level.\nIn Maryland, girls declined 0.92 points, almost an entire grade level, while boys dropped 0.47.\nPrior to the pandemic, girls throughout the country were outperforming boys in math and science on average. But AP's analysis found that in 2023, boys outperformed girls in nine out of every 10 school districts.\nThis was the case in Talbot County, where prior to the pandemic, girls were outperforming boys by 0.24 points. In the 2023-24 school year, boys outperformed girls by 0.17 points.\nBut girls still outperformed boys in two Mid-Shore districts. In Caroline County, girls scored a 4.51 in 2023-24 while boys scored a 4.44. In Dorchester County, girls scored a 3.14 while boys scored a 2.95.\nDorchester County saw the worst decline of the three counties, with girls dropping 1.05 points, while boys dropped 0.85 points. In Caroline County, girls declined by 1.18 points while boys dropped 0.81 points. Talbot County saw girls declining by 0.96 points and boys by 0.55.\nAccording to the Stanford Education Data Archive, no districts in Maryland have fully recovered their pre-2019 math levels.\nThe Star Democrat provided the data to local school districts two weeks ago. Talbot County Public Schools and Caroline County Public Schools did not respond to The Star Democrat's requests for comment. District representatives from those two districts requested specific questions, which were provided but not answered.\nDorchester County started at a lower baseline than the other two Mid-Shore counties, falling well below Maryland's state average. Comparing Dorchester County to the average found in the study, both boys and girls are roughly 2 to 2½ grade levels behind in math.\nThe district's Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Student Services, Jodi Coleman, wrote in an email to The Star Democrat: \"While our girls' math scores dipped slightly more than boys' since the pandemic, the overall gap between genders is small. Both groups showed similar trends, and our overall performance has remained fairly consistent with pre-COVID results.\"\nDorchester County is working to make gains across the board with its \"23 no more\" initiative. The initiative aims to move Dorchester County Public Schools from 23 out of 23 counties in the state to 15th.\nOne year after the initiative was introduced, the county has successfully moved up two spots overall in the state rankings and improved from 23 to 19 in English learning arts and from 23 to 20 in math.\n\"The larger issue is that most of our students — girls and boys — are not yet proficient, which is why our 'Believe in Us: Advancing Our Potential Together' strategic plan focuses on improving achievement for all learners. Addressing any gender differences is embedded in that broader effort,\" Coleman wrote.\nDorchester schools are zeroing in on teacher training, small-group math support and expanded STEM opportunities, while also boosting dual enrollment and career pathways for female students. Coleman says these steps aim to close learning gaps and raise math and reading achievement.\nColeman wrote that Dorchester is seeing early signs of success.\n\"Preliminary benchmark data suggest stabilizing math scores for both genders. Schools reintroducing environmental literacy trips, small-group tutoring and STEM enrichment last spring noted increased engagement,\" Coleman wrote.\nGirls' enrollment in advanced math and science are returning to pre-2019 levels, according to Coleman. Some extracurricular programs, like robotics and coding clubs, are still rebuilding but trending upward.\nColeman wrote that opportunities were affected by in-person restrictions during the pandemic. Hands-on enrichment like robotics, STEM field trips and some environmental experiences were paused or scaled back. This was the case for many school districts.\nDeMorra, the 4-H STEM specialist, said framing math and science in an approachable and inclusive way is critical to engage students, particularly girls.\nThe core philosophy of 4-H is \"learning by doing.\" DeMorra said hands-on STEM activities help students, especially those who don't self-identify as \"STEM people,\" realize they are already using math and science through applied projects.\nMaryland 4-H partners with schools and community organizations to fill some of the hands-on learning gaps, DeMorra said. However, he said it is critical for all educators to work together.\n\"We all have the same basic goal. We should helping each other. And that's in general for 4-H too. We are trying to help each other and continue to do the best that we can for our children, our future,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

a pre-K program plan that is not feasible without Maryland Accreditation and EXCELS Level 4 status; financial assumptions that lack contingency planning for enrollment shortfalls, grant delays, or facility overruns; limited and underdeveloped plans for serving students with disabilities, English learners, and other student groups and an instructional program that remains underdeveloped and not adequately aligned with Maryland College and Career Ready Standards.\nThe committee acknowledged the charter school's group enthusiasm for the classical charter model, timely responsiveness in communication, and a strong commitment to the idea of school choice, Bell said.\n\"But the team also noted authorizing a charter school is not simply about approving an idea, it's about assuming full responsibility for students, staff, and the community under our umbrella,\" Bell said, a level of responsibility that requires readiness, compliance, and sustainability, \"none of which were determined to be sufficiently demonstrated within their application.\"\nFollowing the turbulent meeting Sept. 3 filled with heated discussions in the face of the application's proposed denial, the Queen Anne's County Classical Charter School group returned to the Board Sept 10. to present answer questions and allow for an in depth application review for the Board's decision.\nLead by a Board of Directors with expertise of former teachers and education professionals, the motivation to establish the classical charter school arose to provide options to parents and enhance the current system upon seeing current dropping proficiency rates, founder Audrey Scott said.\nCharter Committee Board of Directors President Ashley MacLeay noted that although seeking autonomy through waivers, the proposed classical charter school would ultimately be a public school part of the QACPS system that the Board of Education would oversee.\nStudent enrollment would be based on a lottery system.\nThe charter committee claimed it was not afforded opportunities for collaboration and was provided little assistance in certain application aspects, like identifying facilities.\nIf approved by the Board of Education, the charter school would continually seek collaboration with QACPS in establishing a charter agreement, as \"one holistic school system,\" she said.\nTo start, the charter school would need six teachers and has already received far more resumes than that of interested teachers, Scott said.\nThe group claimed interest has been overwhelmingly positive from the community including partners like the Giving the Edge Foundation and letters of support from the Queen Anne's County Commissioners.\nWhile not initiated yet, the committee received support from the county to direct mail to every county home to serve as a first general introduction to parents, Scott said.\nWhile letters of support have been received from the community overall, the QACPS Board of Education questioned student sustainability and a \"demonstration of need\" and claimed a lack of parent voices interested in enrolling students.\nCharter committee officials stated they have personally spoken to multiple families in full support of the program, just without time to write letters of support or a hesitancy to speak up at Board meetings.\nWith a potential program so monumental looming for the county, Board of Education member Mathew Drayer questioned how parents couldn't find the time to voice their support.\nA broad petition of county residents as well as outside of the county collected \"well over two hundred signatures,\" that included parents, MacLeay said.\nAlthough limited with polling data, the committee said it was happy to perform more surveys and was confident in the need.\nThe charter committee would ensure future marketing to all 8,000 students across the county's districts, Targeting families with elementary age children including homeschooled, the charter school would welcome reaching where families are, including libraries for an active presence and share what the potential school would entail, MacLeay said.\n\"We are trying to ensure we have viable schools with the right teachers and support and staff and everything they need to be successful,\" Board of Education President Shannon Bent said, and needed to hear from the community if there were additional needs to address.\nScott credited the above and beyond thoroughness forth by QACPS staff and Board of Education in reviewing the application.\n\"We are all in this for the children,\" Kibler said, and encouraged the committee to strengthen their application and resubmit next year.\nThe applicant retains the right to appeal to the Maryland State Board of Education or to resubmit during the next application window.\nThe QACPS Board of Education will next meet Oct 1. at 6 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Huester said their competitors for the funding told them they didn't receive the grant.\n\"I'm not really sure the practice of Office of Head Start not replying to anyone. We found out through a third party, direct competitor for funding actually. Maryland Family Network let us know what was going on,\" Huester said.\nHuester explained the funding was cut because of a decision to apply as a direct recipient instead of a subrecipient.\n\"We have over $1 million in funding. We applied for $3 million in funding, so essentially what we learned is if we continued as a subrecipient with Maryland Family Network, we probably would have had funding, it would have been no issue, but because we chose to apply as a direct recipient, we didn't receive funding,\" Huester said.\nThe decision to apply independently was made by the organization's board, but Huester said if MRCD knew that applying as a direct recipient would impacted its funding, MRDC would've made a different choice.\nHuester said that MRDC reached out to Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st), who sent a letter to the Office of Head Start. Harris said he has not received a response.\nAddressing concerns from residents about the program's end, Huester said MRDC has explored options to provide for the toddlers of Caroline County.\nThe options include introducing a Patty Center model, which aims to help the family as a whole, allowing parents to come on site for services like resume building and job searching while their children are looked after. There is also fee structure option, which consist of exploring what residents could afford to pay to keep a center open at spaces in Greensboro and Federalsburg.\nHuester also discussed converting existing Head Start spots and a collaboration with the Maryland State Department of Education for classroom models. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot school board dives into test score trends\n\n September 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 695\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot school officials took a deeper look at state test scores last week, indicating upward trends in math and English for some grades and dips in others.At a work session on Sept. 15, Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, presented to Talbot Board of Education members breakdowns of 2024-2025 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program scores by grade and student group.\nThe presentation showed increases from the previous year in English proficiency for third and fourth grades, but drops for fifth and eighth grades. Math proficiency spiked year-to-year for fourth, sixth and seventh grades, but the number of students proficient algebra significantly fell.\nThe deeper dive came after the state released test score data for the 2024-2025 school year last month. While proficiency rates increased statewide, Talbot County students saw mixed results. English proficiency dropped to 45.4%, 16th in the state and the largest year-to-year decrease (1.9%) of all districts.\nIn math, 18.9% of students were proficient, 18th in the state and nearly even with the previous year's mark. Other counties, such as Dorchester, saw notable gains, rising spots in the statewide rankings.\nTwo days after the Sept. 15 work session, Talbot Board of Ed Member Deborah Bridges said at a monthly meeting that the district's results kept her up at night.\n\"After our work session on Monday night, I couldn't sleep,\" Bridges said. \"Our scores, it upset me so much. And I wondered, what are we missing? What is going on in our schools?\"\nBoard members largely agreed that the results aren't a matter of pointing fingers at teachers or staff. Instead, they are focused finding solutions to fix some of the problem areas.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said at the work session that she hopes school officials can begin to pinpoint some reasons behind the data trends.\n\"If I look at us, and we're going down, whereas a neighboring county who has a similar population of kids and they're going up, I want to know why,\" Jackson said.\nEinhorn said while the state tests are an \"important measure,\" it's one of many ways to assess academic achievement and growth.\n\"This is one assessment given at a single period of time, which does not always accurately reflect what students know and what they're able to do overall,\" Einhorn said.\nENGLISH\nFifth and tenth grades suffered the largest proficiency drops of 5.6% and 10%, respectively. But fourth grade proficiency rose to 50% in the most recent results. And while third grade proficiency dipped from last year's 47.9% mark, it's still at 43.6%, an improvement over a 35% rate two years ago.\n\"This really speaks to the work that this board has invested in early literacy, and starting to see that trend move up,\" Einhorn said at the work session.\nMeanwhile, most student groups followed the district's overall trend of slightly decreasing in English proficiency. Asian students fell from 68.9% to 51.2%, while Talbot's multilingual learners dropped from 8.7% to 5.1%.\nMATH\nOne of the sharpest drops came in Algebra II proficiency: 32.8% of students passed the state test in 2023-2024; only 7.1% passed in 2024-2025.\nEinhorn acknowledged that as an \"area of need.\" She noted that new math standards for K-8 will go into effect next school year. And in two years, the district will begin integrated algebra courses, infusing geometry concepts, she said.\nFourth grade rose nearly six percentage points to 32% proficiency this past year, while seventh grade had a similar hike from 11% to 17%.\nBy student group, one result stood out: Black students in the district remain under 5% proficient in math. Einhorn admitted the shortcoming.\n\"The less than 5% is indicating that we are still underserving our Black students and that we still need to continue looking at strategies that better prepare them to show what they know and are able to do in mathematics,\" Einhorn said.\nBoard Member Dyshekia Strawberry said she'd like to see the district work with community partners to specifically tackle the gap in math proficiency for Black students.\nBoard members thanked Einhorn for presenting the detailed trends, acknowledging that there's work to be done to get some of the numbers going in a positive direction.\n\"We have to do better, and we're open to hear how we're going to do that,\" Jackson said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The plan, required by the Interagency Committee on School Construction, aims to provide an effective learning environment, minimize disruptions, preserve school property value, maximize facility efficiency, and provide a foundation for risk management and preventive maintenance. The school system has 17 buildings, totaling nearly 960,000 square feet, valued at approximately $678 million. The construction cost per square foot for FY26 is $537, an 11.5% increase from last year. This increase is attributed to inflation and rising labor costs. Tariffs are a looming concern that may further impact costs. The board approved the maintenance plan.Robert Willoughby, director of administrative services, conducted the first reading of the Operation School Nutrition Programs Policy 9910. The policy is an update to a policy from the 1980s, changing the name from \"school lunch program\" to \"nutrition program\" to reflect the inclusion of breakfast. It also clarifies pricing for meals under the Community Eligibility Provision and for a la carte items.Willoughby presented the first reading of Policy 55080 on service animals. The policy aims to comply with ADA regulations and defines a service animal as an animal trained to perform a task for a person with a disability. It explicitly states that emotional support animals and therapy animals are not service animals. By law, service animals are typically dogs, with miniature horses considered under very specific circumstances for mobility issues. The policy outlines considerations for miniature horses, compliance with the law and the development of regulations for implementation.Superintendent Derek Simmons presented the Citizens' Advisory Committee nominees for 2025-2027. The committee is made up of parents and community members who provide feedback to the board. The committee was approved by the board.Kirk Howie, director of student services, provided an unofficial September enrollment update. The current unofficial enrollment is 5608, down about 40 students from last year, which is within the average 3% transition rate for Maryland. Elementary enrollment saw an increase of 53 students, while middle schools had a reduction of 51 and high schools a reduction of 61. Home school/instruction enrollment has increased, with 537 students this year, up from 466 in 2022-2023. \n\n ",

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed digs into student discipline trends\n\n October 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 561\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot County Public Schools officials grappled with the state's guidelines on student discipline during a Board of Education work session Monday.Reviewing the district's data on suspensions, expulsions and more, Darlene Spurrier, director of student services, explained that according to state regulations, administrators must indicate an \"imminent threat\" in order to expel a student.\nExpelling a student is a last resort, Spurrier said, adding that standard came as part of a \"sweeping change\" of the regulation around 10 years ago.\nIn the last three full school years and so far this year, there have been no expulsions of Talbot County students, according to data presented Monday.\n\"It is a very difficult standard to meet,\" Spurrier said. She said that at times it can feel like a crystal ball is needed to determine whether a student poses an imminent threat.\nSuspensions can range anywhere from one to 44 days, Spurrier said. Any mark at 45 days or above is considered an expulsion.\nOut-of-school suspensions have been largely steady. Data presented by Spurrier showed there were 334, 355 and 344 such suspensions in school years 2022-2023, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025, respectively. This year, there have been 46 out-of-school suspensions so far.\nIn the same three-year span, TCPS had 60, 52 and 51 student arrests, and 12, 14 and 32 reportable offenses. Arrests are on school grounds either delivered by paper warrants or physical arrests, while reportable offenses occur off-school grounds and result in action by the school district.\nCompared to neighboring counties, Spurrier pointed out that TCPS has a relatively low rate of students suspended or expelled. In 2023-2024, 5% of Talbot students were suspended or expelled. Queen Anne's County came in at 3.1%, while Caroline (6.4%), Kent (7.1%), Dorchester (16.2%) and Somerset (17.4%) were all higher.\nBullying reports have hovered around the same mark in recent years: 72 in 2022-2023, 73 in 2023-2024 and 65 in 2024-2025.\nBoard President Emily Jackson asked if the district is encouraging students and families to fill out the bullying reports when appropriate.\n\"I know for a while there was both an understanding in the community and kind of a prevailing attitude of, don't fill out the report,\" Jackson said.\nSpurrier said the district never wants \"to discourage a family or a student\" from filling out the report paperwork. Jackson agreed.\n\"Even if it doubles our numbers, even if it looks bad,\" she said.\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi asked Spurrier if the state has certain red flags when assessing disciplinary data. For the most part, Spurrier said the state does not, though she noted the state does track if there is \"disproportionate disciplinary practices,\" especially for Black students and students with disabilities.\nThe student services director said the district is aware it needs to \"make sure that we are being equitable in how we're imposing discipline.\"\nBoard Member Ann O'Connor expressed some concern.\n\"Isn't it just a matter of who's breaking the rules and who's not?\" she said. O'Connor later added: \"I just hope we are not not disciplining students because it looks like we are disciplining more of the Black or underserved (students).\"\nJackson emphasized it's important for the district to consider its discipline interventions for underserved students and whether more funding should be allocated to those groups to proactively solve disciplinary issues.\nSpurrier said it comes down to making sure two different students in two different subgroups are receiving similar discipline.\n\"Are we responding differently to students who have the same offense?\" Spurrier said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The $1.1 million contract was passed unanimously.\nShafer said some preliminary work will be done this spring before school ends. The school play and other concerts or events won't be impacted, Shafer said.\nOver in Cordova, the under-renovation Chapel District Elementary School will receive glazing for its new windows. The window glazing is a security film, Shafer said, a safety measure that \"prevents easy access to the school building.\"\nAll other schools in the district have the window glazing.\nChapel District Elementary is currently under renovation, a multimillion endeavor expected to be done sometime in 2026.\nThe contract is through a Maryland Center for School Safety grant in the amount of $132,000 for the window glazing. Shafer said the district couldn't move forward with it during construction of the renovated school building due to cost limits during the bidding process.\nShafer said he hopes the window security upgrades can be completed this summer. The board unanimously approved the contract.\nBoard President Emily Jackson added that she has \"slight hesitations about privacy\" as it relates to windows in classrooms and libraries at Chapel District Elementary and other schools.\nJackson asked that the board hear more about potential school safety grants in the future, particularly \"in the privacy arena to provide more screening for our students.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The days were filled with numerous agriculture topics and allowed the students to have many hands-on experiences at learning stations lead by industry experts including aquaculture, grain, farm animals, food safety and pollination, he said,\nThis year in particular focused on the variety of career opportunities available within local agriculture, according to Page.\n\"Even if it's in ag, you might not be a farmer,\" said Jenell Eck McHenry of Thompson Ag Consulting Programs.\n\"Our whole premise of the day is to start to get students to really realize what is agriculture, how does it affect their lives, and so on,\" he said.\nAfter the two-day event, seventh-grade students penned essays to showcase what they discovered and answer the question, \"How did your experience change the way you view agriculture?\"\nThe Agricultural Awareness Committee reviewed the essays and selected the most impactful responses as winners.\nThe overall winner of the essay contest was Ellamae Athey of Centreville Middle School.\nFor Centreville Middle School, first place was awarded to Sara Klakring, second place was a tie between Teyauna Johnson and Wyatt Stephens and third place was a tie between Lucas Henderson and JP Tyler.\nFor Matapeake Middle School, first place was awarded to Delaney Grace Pugh, second place to Vivian Dorsey and third place to Jessica Lynn Busch.\nFor Stevensville Middle School, first place was presented to Conner Paterno.\nConstantly growing, this year's event saw over 100 volunteers dedicating their time and resources including animals to showcase ag awareness to the community seventh graders, said Lee Bridgman University of Maryland Extension Program Assistant Agriculture and Horticulture.\nThe partnership between the Queen Anne's County schools and the agricultural community continues to make an educating and exciting program and is already looking forward to next year, Page said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County Ag Center turns 60\n\n July 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 522\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On July 23, 1964, Donald Spies, Thomas Meredith and John Mulder signed on as founders of the Talbot County Agriculture & Education Center on Hiners Lane.With decades of 4-H showcases and county fairs under its belt, the Agriculture and Education Center is turning 60.\nIn partnership with member organizations Easton FFA, Easton Lions Club, Talbot County 4-H, Talbot County Farm Bureau, and Tri-County Ruritan, the Ag Center aims to strengthen rural Talbot County culture and provide agricultural education experiences.\nAmanda Clougherty, president of the Ag Center, says it's a team effort to prepare for large events like the fair.\n\"What makes us unique here is we are independently-owned,\" Clougherty said. \"We are a nonprofit organization. All of our neighboring county fair facilities are all owned by county governments. So we have a lot of things to worry about. We have to worry about facility maintenance, repairs, operations.\"\nAs co-chair of Ag Center's fair committee, Clougherty says that the fair has maintained that unique distinction.\n\"We know who we are,\" she said. \"We're a small, old-time, family-fun outing.\"\nWhile the center is hosting its 41st county fair this week, it serves the community year-round, not just during fair weekend. It hosts events such as weddings, birthday parties, meetings and workshops.\nWith no full-time paid staff members, the Ag Center relies on volunteers through community organizations. It makes for a truly unique and personable experience during any event, Clougherty said.\n\"It's a labor of love and service,\" she said.\nNEW PARTNERSHIPSClougherty says the Ag Center is always open to new relationships throughout the county. For instance, the Rotary Club of Easton recently held its first event at the center to initiate new officers.\nAnother new partnership is coming this fall, as four soccer fields at the property will house Chapel District Sports' first year of soccer practices and games while Chapel District Elementary School is under construction.\n\"I just think it's a really good way to expose people to what we do here and build that community connectedness,\" Clougherty said.\nShe believes that partnership and similar ones will allow \"kids and families to come together.\" She also mentioned an \"ag-accurate book trail\" will be on the grounds of the center by this fall, which will feature readings and activities at multiple stations.\nIMPROVEMENTSAs the Ag Center grows in its community reach, so has the need for facility improvements. Clougherty pinpointed recent upgrades, including up-to-date electric and a new sound system.\nFacility improvements would be completely different without assistance from Maryland 4-H youth, Clougherty said. Through Maryland 4-H's Diamond Clover Award Program, which requires service hours, local youth have transformed the Ag Center.\nShe said 4-H members have been responsible for rebuilding the outdoor stage, barns, installing fans in the buildings and making benches and the sidewalk accessible.\n\"We wouldn't be as far as we are today if it hadn't been for several outstanding youth throughout the years,\" Clougherty said.\nIt's just one example of how the community gives back to the Ag Center that has long served county residents, particularly youth.\n\"It's a special gold star for the kids who see the need and work hard to contribute,\" Clougherty said. \"Because they know they've benefitted from being out here.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Budget, Blueprint, energy are top issues for Shore legislators this session\n\n January 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: General Assembly \n \n 710\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As Eastern Shore legislators prepare to cross the bridge and return to Annapolis for the first day of the Maryland General Assembly's 2025 legislative session on Wednesday, the state's budget is top of mind.\"It's just a tough time right now, and we're going to have to be very cautious and very thoughtful of the citizens and the impacts that our citizens are feeling,\" Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said in an interview with the Star Democrat.\nThe state is facing a predicted $2.7 billion budget deficit in fiscal year 2026. Jacobs said when it comes to the budget process this year, he thinks everything will be on the table. \"The devil is in the details,\" he said.\n\"We're certainly — on the Shore — fiscal conservatives concerned with any cost increase, any tax increase or any cost toward citizens,\" Jacobs said.\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said he hopes state Democrats realize that some state goals, such as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and some climate initiatives, are unrealistic and need to be reexamined.\n\"So I hope there's some reality checks,\" he said.\nDel. Jefferson Ghrist (R- Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said the state has overspent. He said although House leadership seems to be ok with raising taxes to balance the budget, the governor might not be \"comfortable\" with that.\nGhrist said he expects to see a \"clash\" in the Democratic Party regarding the budget.\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) sees this legislative session as a \"defining\" one for Gov. Wes Moore (D).\n\"He's going to have to balance this out within his own party,\" Mautz said about Moore. \"Because the policies that are in place now that have caused these economic problems largely come from the Democratic Party and Democratic leadership.\"\nBLUEPRINT FOR MARYLAND'S FUTUREThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future is another issue that legislators on the Shore expect to be one of the top issues this legislative session.\nThe Blueprint — a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and education quality across the state — has garnered some concern across the state due to funding challenges.\nHutchinson said that with a budget shortfall, the state should be \"pulling back\" on the Blueprint. He said the plan has \"been devastating\" to counties across the state.\nJacobs said he thinks this legislative session will result in adjustments to the timeline of certain Blueprint goals.\n\"I don't think that they're going to do away with Blueprint by any means,\" he said. \"I just think that there may be some changes in the timeline of different parts of it.\"\nMautz said \"something has to happen\" with the Blueprint. He said he isn't sure if legislators will create bills \"to address the damage that's been done\" or create bills that put pauses on the plan.\nENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTFrom solar energy to electric vehicles, Eastern Shore legislators see energy and environment issues as important heading into this legislative session.\nGhrist called the state's renewable energy goals \"virtually impossible to achieve.\" He said he has concerns about who is controlling where solar energy systems are being placed in the state. He plans to put out \"several\" bills that address solar energy.\n\"Our number one industry is agriculture and it's being threatened right now by solar,\" he said.\nJacobs said he has heard that there have been some \"serious conversations\" about expanding nuclear energy in the state. He said he hopes state leadership and legislative committees that deal with energy issues will look more into nuclear energy and figure out if it's a direction the state should be going in.\nWhen it comes to electric vehicles, Hutchinson said he doesn't think the state has the capacity for its electric vehicle initiatives.\n\"There's not enough power stations to be able to charge them,\" he said. \"And based upon what I'm hearing from our local dealers, there's not a market for them and they want to stay with combustible engines.\"\nHutchinson said he expects a lot of debate this session.\n\"And again, I hope that we see some reality coming that we can't continue to afford to spend and that we have to make sure we address this $2.7 billion short fall that's going to get worse and worse each year if we don't do anything today,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Shore legislators worry about tax hikes, energy, education in the wake of General Assembly\n\n April 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 802\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Maryland General Assembly session officially ended Monday night. Lawmakers fought through a very tough fiscal year budget, which had some significant impacts for Eastern Shore communities, legislators said.Members of the Eastern Shore delegation stressed budget difficulties loom over state lawmakers, who spent much of this year's session tackling an over $3 billion deficit.\n\"I think the session was not a good session,\" Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said. \"We've just made Maryland a very expensive, more expensive than it was, and it's going to make us less competitive in the region.\n\"If you believe that economic competitiveness is in fact a priority, I think that it is, and I think that by raising taxes and fees, both at the state level and then forcing the locals to also increase their fees and taxes is a double whammy.\"\nMaryland lawmakers passed a balanced budget Monday, concluding their spring session after months of grappling with the deficit. The final budget included about $2 billion in cuts and about $1.6 billion in tax hikes.\n\"I think we left frustrated that we had to raise taxes $1.66 billion and there was no regard to wanting to really seriously cut expenses from the state budget,\" said Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico).\nEastern Shore Delegation members believe after this year's session, the Shore will see lasting effects both fiscally and in several key industries.\nSolar\nOne of the biggest concerns for the Mid-Shore this budget session has been solar energy.\nA renewable energy bill aimed at increasing generation of energy within the state by promoting solar energy production was passed by both chambers of the state legislature.\nSome Eastern Shore Delegation members feel provisions added to these bills during legislators' deliberations supersede counties' authority regarding solar permitting and regulation.\n\"It undermines all the work that the counties have already done to try to facilitate where and how to put solar,\" Mautz said. \"It includes a new assessment for planting solar, which is going to raise energy costs.\"\nHutchinson echoed this sentiment, saying, \"It falls on deaf ears that the Democrats from Montgomery and Prince George's county all think that they know how the quality of life is here on the Eastern Shore.\"\nUtility bills\nHouse Bill 1035 and Senate Bill 937, known collectively as the \"Next Generation Energy Act,\" include plans to reduce energy bills and address shortfalls by modernizing the state's energy infrastructure and incentivizing in-state energy production.\nEastern Shore Delegation members believe this effort to get the cost down lacked the immediacy rate payers need to address bill hikes.\n\"We have not addressed the number one complaint I received when I arrived in January,\" Hutchinson said, \"rate payers calling to say that their electric bills are astronomical. We put legislation forward to try to lower utility bills, and again, it falls on deaf ears.\"\nEducation funding\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education improvement and funding initiative through 2032, originally outlined an increase in teacher collaborative time, during which teachers are not in classes and can plan, grade or meet with students individually. But with adjustments made in the state's budget to combat the deficit, funding to implement the change has been postponed.\nThe Blueprint also sustained several other cuts and freezes that impact county finances. Multiple Mid-Shore county school boards have had to make budget cut decisions and potential layoffs in response.\n\"So let me take Dorchester County, for example,\" Hutchinson said. \"They pushed down the teachers' pensions. They pushed down the Blueprint. They pushed down other mandates that the state usually paid for, but now it's all the county, they have to pay for (it).\"\n\"The school board is short about $5 million. They just eliminated summer school,\" he said. \"They're looking at having to lay off student support personnel. They say we want to create a world-class education. Yet you look at the results of what's happening in Maryland and say that doesn't make sense.\"\nPotential special sessions\nWhile the 2025 session has ended, Mautz doesn't believe discussion is officially over.\nAs the federal government continues to shift funding priorities, state legislators may need to reconvene to address any impacts this has on the balanced budget, he said.\n\"Counties are probably going to have to raise revenue through taxes and different things,\" Mautz said. \"The federal government is probably going to continue to reduce spending. Then there's a high likelihood that we're going to have a special session.\"\n\"So we would have to go back to Annapolis again to address any changes that that come from federal spending reductions. Just as the federal government is reducing its spending, the state is doing the same thing to the counties, and so where all this ends, it seems to be, taxpayer, taxpayer, taxpayer.\n\"Everybody should know it's very hard to predict how this is all going to play out, but I don't think the discussion about the budget is is officially over.\" \n\n Copyright 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-08-19",
    "author": "Bryan P. Sears Maryland Matters",
    "content": "Court rules digital ad tax violates First Amendment\n\n August 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BRYAN P. SEARS Maryland Matters | Section: State News \n \n 461\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A provision in Maryland's digital ad tax is an unconstitutional restriction on free speech, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.The 2021 law — the first of its kind in the nation — imposes taxes on large tech companies for the digital ads they sell within the state. But it prohibits those companies from passing the tax on to consumers as a surcharge, fee or line item on their bills — what a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals saw as a ban on telling customers about the new added tax.\nIn a ruling that invoked American protests against the Colonial-era Stamp Act, Circuit Judge Julius Richardson wrote that, as then, \"complaining about taxes remains a grand American political tradition.\" And the court said Maryland lawmakers went too far by adding language to the tax bill that was intended to shield them from public criticism.\n\"Perhaps fearing such complaints, Maryland paired its tax with another rule,\" Richardson wrote for the court. \"Companies that make money advertising on the internet must not only pay the tax, but avoid telling their customers how it affects pricing: No line items, no surcharges, no fees.\n\"If companies pass on the cost of the tax, they must do so in silence — keeping customers in the dark about why prices have gone up and thereby insulating Maryland from political responsibility,\" he wrote.\nThe ruling reverses a 2024 decision by U.S. District Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby, who agreed with the plaintiffs — a group of tech firms and business associations — that the law created some First Amendment issues. But she let the law stand because the offending provision had \"many constitutional applications.\"\nFriday's circuit court ruling sent the case back to Griggsby with instructions to determine an appropriate remedy for the plaintiffs.\nThe ruling is a blow to officials who looked to the unique tax to help pay for expensive K-12 education reforms contained in the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. Expenses associated with that law continue to rise and are potentially budget busting — even if the digital ad tax survives the onslaught of legal challenges.\nThe 2021 law — sponsored by Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) — targets big tech firms including Apple, Meta and Google.\nUnder the law, companies reporting $100 million of gross global annual revenue are subject to a 2.5% levy. The tax increases in increments of 2.5% to a maximum rate of 10% levied against companies reporting more than $15 billion in gross global revenue.\nThe state could collect as much as $250 million annually from the digital ad tax, according to a legislative analysis. The funds are earmarked for the education reform program.\nNeither Ferguson nor Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D), the defendant in the lawsuit, immediately responded to requests for comment on the ruling Friday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Health department recommends making condoms available at local high school\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LAURA TAYMAN | Section: News \n \n 643\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last month, Kent County Board of Education members were provided stark facts about the rise in sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in the community, the state, and the country at its recent monthly meeting.Ashley Minietta, communicable disease and family planning contact for the Kent County Department of Health, made a presentation to the board before the holiday break, saying the solution to reversing the trend is \"to provide ground support, monitor trends, and turn data into action.\"\n\"While 20% of Marylanders have an STD, almost half of the cases are ages 15-24,\" Minietta said, citing the 2020 U.S. census map — putting Maryland in the South region of the country, \"It's one of the highest rates in the region.\"\nMinietta said the barriers to effectively preventing both STDs and teenage pregnancies in Kent County are lack of education, the cost of birth control, parental resistance to alternatives, lack of public transportation, the geographic barriers of the rural area and lack of health care options.\nTeen pregnancy rates are down, Minietta said, because parents have been proactive with putting teenage daughters on birth control. But pills and IUDs do not allow the prevention of STDs that can lead to long-term health consequences.\n\"Research in 2020 shows only 9% of sexually active high school students used a condom,\" Minetta said. \"That has only increased.\"\nMinetta shared various ways local school systems are providing a condom availability program to meet the needs of their high school students, including those in Queen Anne's, Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot and Wicomico counties, and counties on the western shore.\nWhile some have availability through the school's nurse's office, others provide a \"brown bag\" approach, where students can pick up a paper bag on an anonymous basis.\nBoard member Aretha Dorsey said that as a parent she was concerned that a program like that would encourage secrets among parents and their children.\n\"I feel like parents' rights are being taken away,\" Dorsey said. \"I believe that kids might form a lack of respect for their parents and think they can do things their own way.\"\nBoard member Francois Sullivan said Kent County and its rural location is a valid argument for such a program.\n\"There is a difference between a nurse providing condoms and a cashier.\"\nWhen asked to share her opinion, student board member Madison Messick said she couldn't even remember her sex education class.\n\"I think this is really important,\" she said. \"There is a stigma. We can't go to Walgreens because we know the cashier. I know kids that would definitely benefit from this.\"\nVienna Walker, supervisor of student services for the Board, said she recommended the board adopt a policy where Kent County students can meet with a high school nurse and ask for information and guidance.\nSuperintendent Karen Couch said she had been asked by parents how students could be opted out of a program if they don't approve. Walker said she would need to check with the state's Department of Education to see how that could be handled.\n\"Some students have much more open communication with school nurses than their parents,\" Walker said. \"Their office is much less threatening to students who then become comfortable enough to come back if they are not feeling great.\"\nThat is Walker's goal. She recommended the board consider approving a program that requires students to visit nurses who can provide education and guidance on condom use.\n\"Nurses also encourage students to be open and honest with their parents,\" Walker said.\nMessick agreed.\n\"Students will participate not because kids don't trust their parents,\" she said. \"The program encourages conversations between parents and their children. It's like therapy where they can't tell parents what their child is talking about. This actually helps to form a better relationship between students and parents.\"\nSchool Board President Joe Goetz said he would like for Walker to get information from other districts on how they manage parent objections.\n\"I think real life examples would help,\" Goetz said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland spent big on youth mental health — but then the budget crisis hit\n\n February 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sasha Allen Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1370\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The new statewide youth mental health program supported behavioral health services for more than 58,000 students in its first eight months of operations from March through October 2024. Four out of every five of Maryland public schools received aid for mental health services under the state's effort.But as the General Assembly moved to balance Maryland's fiscal 2025 budget last spring, lawmakers cut funding for the state's fledgling youth mental health program from Gov. Wes Moore's recommended $110 million to $40 million.\nWith the state's fiscal problems deepening, Moore is recommending the state allocate $40 million annually through 2030 to a program he once suggested should get $130 million a year starting in fiscal 2026.\nMeagan Pantelis, a clinical social worker at Thrive Behavioral Health, said the proposed cuts would decimate services for students that, in many cases, are just getting off the ground.\n\"Whenever I found out about that proposed cut, the very first thing that came to mind is that Gov. Moore is wanting to balance a budget on the backs of our children,\" Pantelis said. \"I just find that to be just egregious. I mean, why are our children the population that we are targeting? Why are they not the population that we want to build up and support?\"\nMoore, however, has stressed the state must act to close a structural $3 billion budget gap driven in part by the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the 10-year, multibillion-dollar education reform plan that created the youth mental health program.\n\"We only have difficult decisions ahead,\" Moore said in his State of the State address in early February. \"We must close this $3 billion budget gap.\"\nThe mental health crisisDuring the 2022-23 school year, over a quarter of Maryland high school students reported their mental health was not good at most or all times, according to a Maryland Department of Health survey.\nThe percentage was only slightly lower for middle school students, with 22% reporting their mental health was not good at most or all times.\n\"We all know generally that there's a mental health crisis,\" said Lorianne Moss, the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission program manager. \"So as sort of the preamble to our first call for proposals, we laid out some data.\"\nThat data, from the Centers for Disease Control, showed 40% of high school students experience persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Citing such statistics, the consortium urged mental health programs and nonprofits across the state to apply for funds.\nApplicants requested a total of $380 million in grants, said Mark Luckner, executive director of the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission, which oversees the consortium. That's more than three times what the consortium had to allocate.\nNevertheless, the state funded mental health service providers in every county.\nPreventing youth suicide is one of the consortium's key goals, said Dr. John Campo, director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Sixteen of the consortium's 129 grants so far focus on suicide prevention.\nSuicide is the second-leading cause of death for people ages 10-14 and third for people ages 15-24, according to the most recent CDC data.\n\"Suicide kills more young people in that age group than cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, infections of all kinds, meningitis, pneumonia, HIV, COVID — the whole nine yards,\" Campo said. \"Add them all together, suicide kills more people than all those things combined.\"\nIn Maryland, the teen suicide rate increased by more than a third from 2014 to 2022. Campo said the state's health care system has been ill-equipped to deal with that increase.\n\"Mental health crisis isn't a priority in most emergency departments,\" Campo said.\nCampo is one of the co-chairs of the consortium's best practices subcommittee, a group that developed a list of evidence-based mental health practices for grantees to implement.\nEach program targets a different facet of the mental health crisis. The responses are also tailored to the varying levels of severity of the mental health conditions different age groups experience.\nThe consortium found through surveys targeted at both students and parents that 90% of students and families were satisfied with the services.\n\"A lot of these practices have been tested,\" Campo said. \"If regional organizations adopt them and implement them with fidelity, we really do want to believe that there will be positive outcomes associated with it.\"\nFrom the city to the ShoreThe youth mental health crisis touches all of Maryland, and so does the state's response — but grants are tailored to the vast differences among Maryland's urban, suburban and rural communities.\nIn Baltimore City, the 11 grants the consortium issued take into account a stigma surrounding mental health services, said Jennifer Cox, director of the University of Maryland School Mental Health Program, which received a $970,000 grant to run a number of programs.\n\"We think in Baltimore City, we have to be a little bit more creative than just saying, 'Come get help,' \" Cox said. \"We know we have good things to offer, we just need to find a good way to offer it.\"\nWorking with trusted community organizations such as churches and youth centers, the program has been able to reach people who would otherwise not seek out mental health treatment, Cox said.\nServices range from in-school counseling from certified clinicians to parent and caregiver education programs.\nMeanwhile, the state's efforts on the largely rural Eastern Shore stress increasing access to treatment in a region that's short of professionals to respond to the youth mental health crisis.\nAccording to the October 2024 report, \"Investing in Maryland's Behavioral Health Talent,\" Maryland is nearly 50% short of the mental health workers it needs.\n\"There's a resounding message of 'we just need more,'\" said Beth Anne Dorman, CEO of For All Seasons, a behavioral health and rape crisis center that received a grant to expand its services in Kent County. \"We need more.\"\nCaroline County, where two organizations won grants to expand their mental health services, faces the same situation, said Derek Simmons, the county's superintendent of schools.\n\"We are a rural county that is less wealthy than a lot of parts of the state,\" said Simmons, co-chair of the consortium's best practices committee. \"So access to behavioral health is near and dear, and a real challenge where I'm at.\"\nAn uncertain future\nIf the General Assembly agrees with the funding levels suggested in the governor's budget, programs that just started last year may have to be eliminated, said Del. Eric Ebersole (D-Baltimore County, Howard).\n\"That group worked in good faith to bring providers online,\" said Ebersole, a consortium member. \"If the government loses them, can you get them back?\"\nDan Martin, senior director of public policy at the Mental Health Association of Maryland, said the proposed cut in planned funding comes at a time when youth mental health care is more important than ever.\n\"At a time when 18% of high school students and 24% of middle school students have seriously considered suicide in the past year, a reduction of this size in school mental health funding could prove disastrous,\" Martin said.\nIf the General Assembly approves Moore's budget proposal, the grants distributed by the program in fiscal years 2025 and 2026 combined will be cut 28% from the total amount distributed the prior two years.\nAsked for comment, Moore's office stressed the governor's proposed allocation for fiscal year 2026 and beyond is exactly what the General Assembly approved for 2025.\n\"Gov. Moore is maintaining the current level of funding for the Maryland Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports,\" wrote a spokesperson from the governor's office. \"The Governor strongly supports behavioral health treatment for Maryland's children, and maintaining current levels of funding during the state's budget crisis reflects that commitment.\"\nThe Mental Health Association of Maryland is urging action to try to persuade the General Assembly to restore funding to a higher level. The organization is circulating a fact sheet with information on the consortium, the work it's done and what a permanent cut in funding would do to students and schools.\n\"Use the above information and write an email to your legislators asking them to restore funding to the Community Supports Partnership Fund,\" the fact sheet said. \"Provide testimony (either written or oral or both) opposing the cut\" at General Assembly hearings.\nAnd under the \"why is funding needed\" section, the Mental Health Association fact sheet reads: \"Dramatic worsening of the behavioral health of children and youth over the last decade.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From crisis to change: COVID-19’s enduring mark on the Eastern Shore\n\n March 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STAFF REPORT | Section: Local News \n \n 642\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic reached the Eastern Shore, its impact lingers in ways both visible and unseen. The empty streets, masked faces, and social distancing markers have faded, but the profound shifts in health care, worship, business and daily life remain.Emma Zonetti never expected the pandemic to reach her tight-knit community.\n\"I remember being in church, actually. My husband's mom told me that this was happening,\" said Zonetti, now a senior clinical nurse with University of Maryland Shore Regional Health. \"And I went, 'Oh, it's nothing to worry about. It's just another virus.' And then quickly did we learn that it was way more than that.\"\nZonetti, who was a clinical coordinator in the telemetry unit at the Shore Medical Center at Easton during the height of the crisis, recalled the stark reality that unfolded as cases surged.\n\"It certainly impacted us far larger than I could ever anticipate,\" she said.\nLate in January 2020, hospitals began screening for the virus as patients arrived in emergency rooms.\nBy March, State Superintendent of Schools Dr. Karen Salmon ordered a closure of schools — a temporary order that extended well into 2021, much longer than anyone anticipated.\nBeaches and boardwalks closed. And by April, the number of positive cases surged and mask orders ensued.\nCOMMUNITY BLINDSIDEDThe first confirmed case of COVID-19 on the Eastern Shore was reported in Talbot County on March 16, 2020. Since then, there have been 8,056 confirmed cases in the county and more than 40,000 across the Mid-Shore. The virus claimed the lives of 592 Mid-Shore residents.\nFor religious communities, the impact was swift and disruptive. Pastor Doug Morley of Greater Impact Church in Greensboro said the closure of worship spaces came at a critical time for his newly merged congregation.\n\"Building on the momentum of coming together for greater Kingdom impact in 2019 and gearing up for what would potentially be one of our highest attended worship experiences on Easter Sunday (April 12, 2020), we were definitely blindsided by the mandated closure of all religious gatherings,\" Morley said.\nChurch leaders scrambled to adapt, turning to Facebook Live for virtual worship and launching a \"drive-in\" service using a tractor-trailer bed as a stage and an FM transmitter to broadcast services to parked cars.\n\"It forced us to think outside the four walls of the church,\" Morley said. \"That shift in approach has remained with us.\"\nEven after indoor services resumed, Morley noted, worship attendance has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. While some members embraced online services, others simply fell out of the habit.\nLASTING LEGACYWhen Maryland lifted its COVID-19 state of emergency on July 1, 2021, many expected a swift return to normalcy. In some ways, that happened — travel resumed, restaurants filled and hugs replaced distanced greetings. But the pandemic left lasting imprints on the Eastern Shore.\nTelehealth became commonplace. Remote work grew. Businesses closed, moved or downsized. Schools and universities permanently integrated virtual options. Many delayed retirement. Awareness of mental health surged as loneliness and isolation persisted.\nThe pandemic reshaped our priorities, forcing people to rethink work, education and social connection. Some changes were temporary, but others — like digital access and hybrid work models — are likely here to stay.\nWhile it has taken a few years to get back to some semblance of normalcy, the impact of COVID-19 upon regular worship attendance is still evident.\n\"We have not returned to pre-pandemic numbers, and we still have individuals and families who choose to worship online rather than in-person,\" Morely said. \"A few who once attended regularly have gotten out of the habit and find it difficult to return on a consistent basis.\"\nAs the Eastern Shore reflects on the past five years, the region has found resilience in adversity. Communities innovated, businesses adapted and individuals discovered new ways to connect. The pandemic may have left its mark, but so, too, did the spirit of perseverance that defines the Shore. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "As young Americans struggle with mental health, online support surges\n\n June 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAX SCHAEFFER Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1705\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Adolescents across the country have increasingly suffered from anxiety and depression over the last 10 years, and school officials in Prince George's County noticed the same trend locally.So when the county's public school system needed to support its struggling students, it did what schools and young people across the nation are doing — it turned to an online service.\nFunded by the statewide effort to bolster youth mental health, the county partnered with Hazel Health, which specializes in providing online counseling to school-age children.\n\"I think accessibility is huge,\" Emily Pasco, the school district's mental health coordinator, said of the partnership. \"That's historically been a barrier for mental health services — transportation is an issue.\"\nSupporters of online mental health services argue that they offer a convenient option in an era when providers are in short supply. According to a 2024 federal study, more than a third of the nation's residents live in an area where there aren't enough mental health professionals.\nEnter online services such as Hazel, Gaggle, Counslr and Cope Notes.\n\"We are not a silver bullet; we are not going to solve everyone's problems, but we can be a great gap-fill,\" said Andrew Post, Hazel's president.\nOnline mental health services surged in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic when most in-person options were shut down, and it has remained popular in the years since.\nWith the online medium evolving every day, there is no consensus about it among psychological researchers, but various studies have shown online interventions can do some good.\nFor example, a 2024 study from the National Institutes of Health found there were \"promising results regarding the effectiveness of online interventions in young people, especially for symptoms of anxiety and depression and for training of social functioning.\"\nMegan Taylor, an independent licensed clinical psychologist from Northern Virginia with online and in-person therapy experience, said online therapy can sometimes feel safer to patients than seeing a therapist in person.\nYet the online medium makes it easier for unlicensed or unreliable providers to provide services they aren't qualified to provide, said Taylor, who has extensive experience with youngsters with autism.\n\"I feel really passionate about the fact that there are many therapists, who advertise themselves as being neurodiversity affirming or specializing in autism, but really haven't had that training,\" Taylor said.\nDespite such concerns, online therapy is expected to grow as an option for troubled young people nationwide. Zion Market Research projects the global market for online therapy for teens to more than triple from 2023 through 2032.\nThat being the case, here's a closer look at several online mental health care options available to young people today:\nHazel\nHazel was one of the big winners in the state's first round of grants from its new youth mental health program, receiving $2.75 million in Prince George's County, $1.5 million in Baltimore City and smaller grants in Charles and St. Mary's counties.\nStudents in Prince George's County and elsewhere access Hazel's counselors through video conference, either at school or home. Post said the medium offers limitations as well as benefits for the students who access it.\n\"We are raising a generation of children who are very comfortable, for better or worse, with technology,\" Post said. \"This construct of, 'I'm going to drop you off at this office and I'll pick you up in an hour,' is a little jarring, compared to, 'I'm going to hand you this iPad and you're going to see this person and talk to them.'\"\nDespite being a proponent of telehealth therapy, Post acknowledged for severe cases, in-person treatment always has to be an option for young people.\nPrince George's County — like Miami-Dade County, Florida, where Post taught and served as an administrator — is a majority-minority community where over half of the student population qualifies for free and reduced lunch. This comes with additional mental health challenges for students to navigate.\nIn 2024, Prince George's County saw 113 homicides.\n\"Gun violence is a significant issue,\" Pasco said. \"Students being affected by either witnessing gun violence, or being affected by someone that they know being a victim of gun violence.\"\nThe top two most common reasons for referral, according to Pasco, are depression and anxiety, consistent with national trends.\nOne way Hazel looks to serve the unique needs of communities like Prince George's County is to only use providers who are licensed in the state.\n\"Number two is making sure that our population group truly reflects the population that we serve,\" Post said.\nTwo out of every five Hazel therapists fluently speak a language other than English, according to Post.\nGaggle\nLike Hazel, Gaggle — which began in 1999 as an early email communication system between teachers and students in schools — provides online therapy. The company has evolved over the last 25 years, first into an online safety management platform and now a provider of teletherapy.\nGaggle's safety management operation is still the primary service it provides to school districts, with over 1,500 districts using it. Just over 100 school districts use its telehealth service, although no Maryland school district uses it.\nGrowing the company's telehealth operation is a company priority, said Heather Durkac, Gaggle's chief innovation officer.\n\"Gaggle started and is involved with protecting those 'digital hallways' — what kids were emailing, sending, sharing, uploading, everything that was on district-provided devices or accounts,\" she said.\nIncreasing concerns about mental health and self-harm — which company officials noted through its safety monitoring service — inspired the company to offer teletherapy as well.\n\"I used to talk about [during training with school districts] if students would send something like a suicide note or share suicidal thoughts,\" Durkac said. \"Now I talk about it in a position of when students are sharing those suicidal thoughts or a suicide note. That really just compelled us to do something more.\"\nThe company made 20,000 phone calls to school districts for situations their safety analysts deemed an imminent threat for a student, and over 400,000 emails to school districts for concerns of a lower level, according to Durkac.\nDurkac shared a story of Gaggle's intervention when a student wrote a suicide note on a Google Doc on his school-issued Gmail account, which school officials saw because Gaggle's safety management system gave them access to it. Gaggle contacted the school, and officials there got the student's family and police involved. The student was found at the local train tracks and taken to a hospital.\nWith a combination of Gaggle's services, a school district could continue to work with the student to help prevent a similar situation.\n\"If it is one of those districts that has both services, they can choose to move them right into our Gaggle therapy services. If not, they have other resources,\" Durkac said.\nIf one decides to access Gaggle's therapy services, the company employs a team of licensed therapists that mostly do part-time work online while working with their own practice or serving as a supervisor somewhere else.\nCounslr\nAnother of the most widespread online counseling providers is Counslr, a service that partners with large companies, schools and communities. Counslr is partnered with school districts across 11 states but not Maryland — although it works with Child Trends, a Rockville-based nonprofit that researches child well-being.\nCounslr offers text-based mental health support with a licensed mental health professional at any hour of the day. Students complete a basic intake form and are matched with a professional who is supposed to best fit their needs.\n\"We are particularly effective at what we call 'reaching the traditionally unreachable,'\" Counslr co-founder and CEO Josh Liss said.\nHe said Counslr's text-based method helps people avoid typical hurdles like cost, inconvenience or negative stigma around getting help.\n\"The majority of the sessions on our platform deal with relationship issues,\" Liss said. \"Very challenging to have a video session, when the person you want to talk about is lying in the bed next to you.\"\nCounslr is free for the students or members of its partner school districts or organizations. That entity pays Counslr for its services to be accessible to its students or members.\nLiss said he is confident in Counslr's ability to help its users, but recognizes its limits.\n\"We very intentionally do not provide therapy,\" Liss said. \"Our counselors don't diagnose, they don't treat and they don't prescribe medication.\"\nWhen someone requires a more intensive form of care, like therapy, the company works with the school counseling office to facilitate that, Liss said.\nCope Notes\nCope Notes founder Johnny Crowder said he grew up with \"severe mental illness\" and had always resisted seeking treatment.\nOnce he got older and began to study psychology and neuroscience, that aversion turned to a curiosity and passion for helping people.\n\"I started texting people health education content from my phone,\" Crowder said, \"and eventually started building it into something more nuanced.\"\nThis is how Crowder developed Cope Notes, a subscription-based service that sends users a text at a random point in the day.\nThe texts are written by a peer, or someone with experience with whatever challenge their text references, then reviewed by Cope Notes' clinical oversight panel of mental health professionals before being sent out.\nOne of the biggest challenges is finding a text that will be general enough to apply to a range of subscribers but specific enough to help. The service is anonymous, so the providers aren't aware of who they're texting.\n\"We're serving people, let's say one of them is a rural teenager with bipolar and one person is like an urban senior with no mental health conditions,\" Crowder said. \"How the heck do you craft a content library that is applicable across all of those demographics, if you don't have that information?\"\nAnswering this question has become a big part of the company's content review process.\nNo two people ever get the same text at once, and the text comes through at a random time, although the company is working on features that will allow people to personalize their experience, according to Crowder.\nThe current Cope Notes pricing model allows someone to purchase an individual subscription for an annual cost of just over $100. Cope Notes also offers group subscriptions for companies or schools.\nCrowder recognizes Cope Notes is not a replacement for therapy. He said he feels Cope Notes is a resource that can be used to get someone ready for treatment in therapy, or help someone who has finished their therapy have some consistent support.\n\"I would say it's a great step up or step down [from therapy],\" Crowder said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As I said Tuesday, this is about Meals til Monday as a whole, but it really felt good to be honored.\"\nAllen began working volunteering for Meals til Monday during the pandemic. She then obtained her community health worker certificate to help people access services like Medicare and Medicaid. Allen said this naturally aligned with her work at Meals til Monday.\nHer recognition comes after a yearlong process of filing for grants, receiving donations and working with community organization partners to buy a refrigerated van, which allows Meals til Monday's summer program to reach more children in Dorchester County and expands the program's capabilities.\n\"It's not necessarily about how many more kids that we're reaching as much as it's about what else we can give the kids,\" Allen said. With the van, Allen said they are able to pick up large bins, also known as gaylords, of produce and frozen foods that would otherwise go bad.\nSummer is identified by Food Action and Research Center as the hungriest time for kids because they lose access to free school meals. In Dorchester County, students are provided free daily breakfast and lunch through a federally funded program called the Community Eligibility Provision.\nThis provision is available if 25% or more of the student population participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations or Medicaid, according to the United States Department of Agriculture's website.\n\"We have partnered with Dorchester County Public Schools and we are delivering two meals for seven days to anyone that registers for children 18 and under,\" Allen said.\nAllen said Meals til Monday is still providing regular weekend meal bags for anyone who needs them, and emergency food services are available with options for pick-up or delivery by appointment.\nAllen encourages anyone who wants to volunteer to sign up on the website. \"One of the things that we're trying to do as we continue to grow as an organization is to have the appropriate policies and waivers and things like that for our volunteers.\" Those can be found at midshoremealstilmonday.org.\n\"It feels absolutely wonderful. I am just so honored,\" Allen said about receiving recognition from No Kid Hungry. \"Our primary mission is to feed children.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Opioid Restitution Funds to focus on schools and health education\n\n August 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Andrea Grabenstein agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 518\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Centreville — With numerous proposed local projects dedicated to opioid awareness and limited federal funding, Queen Anne's County Commissioners prioritized public schools and the department of health educational support programs for opioid restitution funding Aug. 12.The county's Local Opioid Abatement Plan included several proposed projects to utilize local opioid restitution funds provided by the state to combat the opioid crisis. The county only has about $677,000 available in funding, and all the projects outlined total over $1 million, according to County Administrator Todd Mohn.\nQueen Anne's County Public Schools Opioid Education Partnership will utilize $209,025 of the opioid restitution funds in preventing youth opioid misuse through a school-based program and student-led awareness campaigns. It also aims to educate the broader community through public events, and distributing data-rich materials.\nQueen Anne's County Department of Health Educational Support programs will be provided $89,251 to strengthen overdose education, prevention, and response.\nThis project also includes a re-entry program for individuals released from the detention center and an expansion to the court-assisted recovery program to provide alternatives to incarceration.\nThe commissioners reached a consensus to reconsider other programs at a future time as additional resources and partnerships become available.\nCounties were awarded Maryland's opioid restitution funds to have autonomy to create plans on how to address avoiding addiction in communities, according to County Health Officer Brice Strang.\nPrograms that were traditionally funded have been denied funding this year, including the public school program, he said.\nStrang is now recommending the Board of Health create a county evidence-based mechanism to support current programming and showcase how it is working in the community, such as the school based programing. Strang recommended using the funding to backfill the programs, and \"wait and see\" on federal and state funding.\nA constant messaging to youth in particular is important, he said, and the commissioners praised the works of the Drug Free Coalition, the Student Ambassadors, and county partnerships.\n\"One of the things we already know is prevention is cheaper than treatment,\" Strang said.\nRemembering when programs initially began, Commission President Chris Corchiarino noted just how far the community has come in regard to opioid awareness and preventing overdoses.\nTo continually keep overdose numbers down, Corchiarino said, new initiatives are always needed to keep awareness moving forward and make sure preventive programs stay at the forefront.\n\"And that forefront is in our schools, for sure,\" Commissioner Phil Dumenil said.\nMore information about Queen Anne's County Drug Free Coalition can be found at qacgoespurple.org.\nIn other business it was noted, phase three of the South Island Trail extension project took one step closer as a construction and paving bid was awarded to David A. Bramble Inc. in the amount of $593,030.\nThis approximately 3,500 feet portion of the project faced time constraints due to its wooded and wildlife areas and is set to begin Sept. 1.\nWith a grant through the Maryland Office of Tourism Development, Queen Anne's County Economic and Tourism Development will be taking the show on the road with a mobile visitors center trailer to be purchased from Advantage Trailers for $91,778.\nThe trailer will serve to elevate tourism throughout the county by strategically placing it in high traffic areas and events. \n\n © Copyright © 2025",

    "content": "Talbot Council introduces 2025 budget\n\n April 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 511\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On Tuesday evening, the Talbot County Council voted unanimously to introduce the proposed fiscal year 2025 general fund budget of $163,970,000.The budget will include an education increase of $3.65 million from the 2024 budget.\nTalbot County Public Schools will receive $54.6 million in total funding, according to the proposed budget. This increase will go toward the capital project request for planned Chapel District Elementary School renovations and other capital projects.\nThe increase in the education budget is due, in part, to the implications of the Maryland Blueprint for Education plan. Blueprint is a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state by increasing education funding by $3.8 billion each year over the next 10 years.\n\"Maryland Blueprint required local share funding to increase by $1.053 million for FY2025 budget,\" Martha Sparks, finance director for Talbot County, said at the Tuesday meeting. \"In addition to the mandated funding, the county has included an additional appropriation of $2.6 million. Funding to support Talbot County Schools increased overall by $3.65 million above FY24 levels.\"\nEducation spending represents 37.7% of the county's total proposed budget. These numbers include Talbot County Public Schools, Chesapeake College and the Talbot County Free Library expenses.\nThe budget also allocates an additional $1.5 million in capital improvement project funding for Talbot County Public Schools to prioritize other projects.\nThe budget discussion included the option to expand the amendment of the 1-cent increase in property tax rates for public safety.\nIn November 2020, Talbot County voters approved an amendment allowing a 1-cent increase to the property tax rate to support public safety spending. This increase began in the FY2022 budget and will continue until the FY2026 budget.\nRevenues from the 1-cent increase have been used to fund 26 new public safety positions across departments, such as deputies, paramedics, emergency medical technicians and 911 operators. The funds from the amendment have allowed for inclusion of sheriff's office, paramedics/EMTs and correctional officers in enhanced retirement programs for public safety employees.\nSparks noted that the county has used more than the funds provided by the 1-cent increase to public safety.\n\"The county has used more than the revenues generated from the 1 cent to enhance public safety personnel serving the citizens and visitors of Talbot County,\" she said.\nThe council has the option to allow county residents to extend the 1-cent increase beyond FY2026 through a ballot initiative for voters in the November 2024 general election.\nClay Stamp, county manager for Talbot County, expressed his admiration for the county's finance team for their work on the budget.\n\"There's a lot of hard work that went into drafting the FY 25 proposed balanced budget,\" Stamp said. \"While we're here tonight, I want to thank the council for your cooperation and support over the last number of months.\"\nTwo public hearings will be held to gather community input before final approval.\nA public hearing will be held on May 7 at 2 p.m. in the Talbot County Courthouse and at 7 p.m. in the Easton Elementary School cafeteria, located at 307 Glenwood Avenue. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County commissioners discuss FY 2025 budget, years ahead\n\n May 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 878\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — On May 7 the Caroline County Commissioners convened to present the fiscal year 2025 budget, but the budget discussion looked at what's to come in years ahead.Discussions featured two prominent, long-term issues — the county's revenue-generating landfill and the state-mandated Blueprint for Education program.\nThe budget overview also covered the operating budget, capital budgets, proposed tax rates and municipal real property tax differential rates.\nLooking forward, Commissioner Larry Porter said The Mid-Shore II Regional Landfill will generate $420,000 a year in revenue if it stays in Caroline County.\nIn the late 1980s, due to new federal regulations, the counties had to close their landfills and replace them with new landfills. In response to this new regulation, Talbot, Caroline and Queen Anne's counties engaged with MES to form a partnership where each county would take turns hosting a landfill for a 20-year term. Kent County later joined that partnership.\nCaroline County is hosting the current landfill and, under the original arrangement, would be off the hook at the end of 2030 when Queen Anne's County would take over the responsibility of host. However, the partnering counties have agreed to allow the landfill to stay in Caroline County for 12 years longer than initially planned.\nDan Fox, deputy administrator, said the county will receive a revenue increase of around $12.3 million over the duration of the extended agreement at a meeting held earlier on May 7. The counties agreed on a $3 per ton post fee until 2030. In 2031 it will rise to $6.\n\"Landfill is a revenue benefit to the county. Down the road, we will need this money,\" Porter said.\nThe other topic discussed by commissioners was the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a massive educational program that includes salary increases for teachers and more funding for early education.\nThe commissioners are concerned about its expense to the county.\nWhile dramatically boosting state funding for public education over a decade, the Blueprint also asks local school districts — and taxpayers — to do their part.\nIn a letter to Gov. Wes Moore, the Maryland Association of Counties last November listed a litany of concerns. They said the Blueprint's cost estimates don't take into account the bottom-line local impact of several major spending items, including construction costs for additional classrooms needed under the plan's expansion of pre-K and the new minimum $60,000 teacher salary starting in 2026.\n\"It is a bad program and we have to figure out a way to pay for this,\" Porter said.\nEducation-related expenses made up the top expenditure for Caroline County in FY 2025. The Board of Education will receive about $17.1 million if the proposed budget is approved, about $2.3 million more than last year.\nRounding out the top four expenditures are the sheriff ($5,534,994), corrections ($5,889,769) and emergency medical services ($5,563,069).\nThe top three revenue generators for fiscal year 2025 are property taxes ($28,704,000), income taxes ($20,200,000) and a disparity grant from the state ($4,686,791).\nThough commissioners voted to maintain the same tax rates as last year, the county will bring in more revenue from property taxes in FY 2025 due to an increase in the assessed value of properties in Caroline County.\nBecause of this increase, the state will provide less funding to the county in its annual disparity grant.\nAccording to the Maryland Department of Legislative Services, the disparity grant is \"where the local income tax is below 75% of the statewide average. Under the program each eligible jurisdiction receives a grant that enables the per capita local income tax revenues to reach 75% of the statewide average.\"\nDeputy Administrator Dan Fox said that our state disparity grant is being funded at $615,525 less than last year.\n\"That is a state-driven formula that is based off of wealth. We changed in percentage there, which means we receive less money this year,\" Fox said.\nThe tax differential rate was discussed for various municipalities.\nPorter described the tax differential as \"revenue that the county does not collect. It is not money being taken from the towns or given to the towns. It does not affect town budgets in any way. It is money that the town does not collect.\"\nFox said, \"The county is looking to maintain the property tax rate at 98 cents per 100 of all unincorporated areas as well as the towns that do not receive a differential,\" he said.\n\"This year we are looking provide Denton with the same tax rate as the prior year with 92 cents- a six cents differential to get you to 92 cent county tax rate. Federalsburg will have a county tax rate of 90 cents. Greensboro will remain at 92 cents. Preston would receive and remain at 97 cents and Ridgely would be at 93 cents,\" said Fox.\nCommissioner Frank Bartz said they go through the budget line by line. And although there were some conversations, by and large they agreed on each item.\nTwo people Sue Simmons, interim director of Caroline County Arts Council and Dr. Cliff Coppersmith, President of Chesapeake College, both came up and stated how grateful they were for the county's support.\nThey had scheduled an hour and a half for this meeting, but it only took around 45 minutes. One commissioner, Travis Breeding, was \"under the weather\" and did not attend live.\nThe FY 2025 budget is scheduled for potential adoption during the Commissioners of Caroline County meeting on May 28. \n\n (c) Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In some ways, that fiscal pressure has increased since.Michael Sanderson, the executive director of the Maryland Association of Counties, briefed the Talbot County Council on those financial troubles and more during a special meeting Tuesday.\nHe told council members a budget shortfall of potentially $600 to $800 million could be facing lawmakers in Annapolis. Fixing that is \"not easy, but not impossible,\" he said.\n\"There are a couple of years of that in our forecast, and then it gets really serious,\" Sanderson said.\nWhen fiscal year 2028 arrives, Sanderson warned that the state will run out of money in its trust fund that's been used for The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's expansive and optimistic education initiative.\nMany counties have been under significant financial pressure due to state requirements stemming from Blueprint. Sanderson says the state will be feeling that level of pressure soon.\n\"The counties are feeling it now,\" he said. \"The state doesn't really feel it for a couple years down the road, and that has been a meaningful disconnect.\"\nWithout significant timeline adjustments for Blueprint from the state, MACo feels there will continue to be that disconnect between the fiscal situation of the state versus the situation counties are facing. State funding for transportation, though, is already causing serious impacts, Sanderson said.\n\"The canary in the coal mine that's already chirping is in transportation,\" he told the council members. \" … The conversation in the summer time is sometimes ambiguous and hazy and that sort of thing. But this year, not so much. They were just saying, 'If there aren't already shovels in the ground, we can't afford the next thing.'\"\nThe Maryland Department of Transportation has been forced to delay many statewide projects amid a significant budget deficit. Earlier this month, the department released a draft plan that showed $1.3 billion in cuts from the state's six-year transportation plan.\nSanderson noted the \"state's transportation challenge is not a function of the Key Bridge\" rebuild, which is set to begin next year.\nAt the county level, council Vice President Pete Lesher said Talbot County is \"finding itself in a slightly different place\" than others.\n\"We are going through a number of capital construction projects, our health department, our sheriff's office, our 911 center,\" Lesher said, emphasizing some of those projects are receiving \"pandemic-era related funds\" from the federal government.\n\"The pinch that a lot of counties are feeling right now, the income tax, is not yet being felt in Talbot County,\" Lesher said. \"We can look around at our neighbors and see what is coming, even though we are not yet in that position now.\"\nLesher thanked Sanderson and MACo President Johnny Olszewski Jr. for their work to represent the counties at the state level year-round.\n\"We know that we are stronger together in Annapolis,\" Lesher said. \"And we see every year what a powerful voice MACo is for all of us jointly.\" \n\n Copyright 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Many of our grants cross fiscal years, so we must adjust the revenues to match the expenditures that were actually seen at year end,\" Hignutt said.\nThen she shifted the attention to expenditures like driver salaries for transportation. Between fuel costs and bus driver salaries, the school system overspent about $39,000. She also mentioned parking lot repavement projects and classroom renovations.\nThere was a $5,782,498 surplus noted in the total budgeted revenues. According to Daniel Fox, deputy county administrator, the excess of revenue over expenditures is retained by the Board of Education to go to its fund balance.\nThe commissioners approved the amended budget.\nEMPLOYEE ADVISORY BOARDNext up was the Employee Advisory Board, an authority that overlooks the corrections, emergency services, planning and codes, public works, recreation and parks, and administration departments. There is also a non-voting member department, the Department of Human Resources.\nTodd Lord, chairman of the Advisory Board for Caroline County, thanked the commissioners for improving pensions for retirees and achieving competitive pay increases to help with recruitment and retention.\nThe board also wants cost of living adjustments due to the inflation following the pandemic.\nLord proposed an initiative to go forward as he hears from staff about pay and salaries.\n\"We recommend merit pay increases annually for step based off of employee evaluations. We want to get away from the bunching of salaries. Health care plans for retirees, that is another one of our initiatives being discussed heavily in departments,\" Lord said.\nHe said the goal was to increase retention and have attraction for the employees under the board's care.\n\"Right now we want to provide a health care plan that employees can take into retirement,\" Lord said. \"Having their pension in retirement would be a huge benefit in retention for our staff.\"\nCommissioner Frank Bartz responded, \"Health care for retirees, that is a hard undertaking for the county.\"\nAnother commissioner said the same.\nPorter said, \"I don't foresee that we are going to be able to do health care benefits for people who are retiring at 55. The same inflation figures that you are using, we are facing as well.\"\nPresident Travis Breeding said, \"We have to find that balance — taking care of our employees and taking care of our tax payers and the constituents of the county.\"\nPUBLIC WORKS REORGANIZATIONRobin Eaton, director of the Department of Public Works, asked the commissioners for the authority to reorganize the department to create a project manager position. He spoke of maintaining the 80 miles of dirt roads in the county.\n\"Our original structure had three crew leaders, so doing away with one of those crew leader positions and creating a project inspector slash utility locator,\" Eaton said.\n\"It is actually three crews. Two under crew leaders and one dirt road crew with four employees under the road superintendent,\" Kathleen Freeman, county administrator, said.\nThe commissioners approved the reorganization. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Legislators talk state budget before heading back to Annapolis in January\n\n December 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 557\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — The state of the state's budget took up a large part of the conversation at a Dorchester Chamber of Commerce luncheon with state legislators on Dec. 4.The Lower Shore delegation answered questions from chamber members regarding concerns about Maryland's fiscal health, with a looming $2.7 billion state budget deficit predicted in fiscal year 2026.\n\"The reality is that if you continue to do the things that have gotten us into this deficit, it's only going to take us back there again,\" Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said. \"There needs to be a structural, fundamental change.\"\nMautz and Dels. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico), Chris Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) all spoke at the chamber lunch. They, along with the rest of the state's legislators, will head back to Annapolis in January for the 447th session of the Maryland General Assembly.\nIn talking about the state's budget, Mautz also said there should be incentives in place to try to drive state agencies to save money.\nSample-Hughes said the state should do its fiscal homework and find out what it \"really (has) to work with.\"\n\"But I do believe that we can still address and attack some of these goals that we have, whether it's education, whether it's climate, whether it's criminal justice,\" she said. \"We can do it in a pragmatic way.\"\nAdams said to solve the budget problem, the state has to leverage and grow its private sector.\n\"You do not do what we've done for the past two years,\" he said. He said the state and its leadership need to stop spending so much, own up to the problem and stop blaming it on COVID-19.\nHutchinson expressed his concerns with the transportation budget and the lack of funding for many infrastructure projects across the state.\n\"We've got to pay attention to our transportation budget,\" he said.\nBLUEPRINTThe legislators also talked about the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state through increasing education funding by $3.8 billion over a 10-year period.\nSample-Hughes said although Blueprint's goals are important, the General Assembly's decision to pass the plan has contributed to the state's budget deficit. She later advocated for giving more resources to the nonprofits that already serve 3 and 4 year olds, rather than putting money toward expanding early childhood education in the state's public school systems.\nMautz said he thinks the project needs to be paused so that the plan's strengths and weaknesses can be better evaluated.\nJUVENILE CRIMEThe legislators also talked about the state of juvenile crime in Maryland, with Sample-Hughes calling for the removal of Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi.\nHutchinson said that with recent juvenile justice reforms going into effect Nov. 1, he doesn't think a lot of legislators are going to want to discuss juvenile crime this upcoming session.\n\"Because they'll say, 'We just put that in place. We haven't even been able to see the results,'\" he said.\nAdams said law enforcement is needed now more than ever and officers need to be able to do their jobs.\n\"If you want a society, if you want a City of Cambridge, if you want an Eastern Shore (or) State of Maryland, if you want a United States that is civil, there have to be consequences,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If passed at a future meeting, they will approve a combined $1.5 million in funding for three projects: new auditorium lights at Easton High School ($817,321), light replacements at St. Michaels Middle High School ($556,000) and athletic field improvements across the district ($116,679).\nThe fiscal year 2025 budget already accounted for the capital costs, County Manager Clay Stamp noted. The three bills would simply authorize the usage of funds for those three projects, respectively.\nTalbot County Public Schools Director of Operations Kevin Shafer said Easton High's auditorium lights date back to the school's renovation in 1997.\nTalbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher said he's noticed \"how desperately needed this lighting system is.\"\n\"In order to put on some of the really quality student productions that we've seen at Easton High School, I believe that some of the lighting directors have been bringing equipment in from … the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and other places to supplement the antiquated equipment that the auditorium itself has,\" Lesher said.\n\"We've moved into an era of LED lighting, which didn't exist back in 1997,\" Lesher added. \"This is going to be a huge leap forward.\"\nShafer said the light replacements and improvements at St. Michaels Middle High School will complete the ongoing LED conversion product across the entire St. Michaels campus. Grant funding allowed for new side lights at St. Michaels Elementary, Shafer said.\nThe $117,000 for athletic field improvements will help the district move forward with its grass field upgrades.\n\"Generally speaking, the athletic field improvements are going to be surrounding the current fields that we have, grass fields,\" Shafer said. \"(We are) doing some longstanding improvements related to some issues or concerns that came up.\"\nA public hearing on the three bills will be held during Talbot County Council's Feb. 11 meeting at 5:30 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Sen. Van Hollen talks federal grants pause with Eastern Shore legislators\n\n February 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 758\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n While speaking with Eastern Shore legislators Friday morning, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said a short-lived pause of federal funding earlier this week had impacts on local organizations such as fire stations and law enforcement agencies.Monday, President Donald Trump's budget office issued a memorandum ordering a pause on federal grants and loans. A U.S. district judge temporarily blocked the pause Tuesday before the White House rescinded the memo the following day.\n\"Because of the public outcry, they did pull back on this overall freeze,\" Van Hollen said. \"But there's still a whole lot of uncertainty and confusion. So if you are hearing from folks on the Eastern Shore that are recipients of federal programs that are being disrupted, please let us know.\"\nAt the weekly Eastern Shore Delegation meeting, Del. Steven Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) asked Van Hollen to elaborate on his perspective of what happened.\nVan Hollen said the memo from the Office of Management and Budget brought forth confusion for government agencies. The senator heard from thousands that were impacted, he said in an email newsletter.\n\"It was very broadly worded and very ambiguous,\" Van Hollen said. \"Federal agencies interpreted this based on what it said. Essentially, they did freeze a lot of ongoing payments to organizations that do important community work.\"\nArentz said some of the spending that was paused could be viewed as \"questionable\" in the first place.\n\"I think that's the point that was being made about that,\" Arentz said. \"I keep getting questions on it, because it does look like when you portray it in one way, it looks bad, but in the other way, you look at some spending that people would have questions on. And I think that's part of the explanation I try to give.\"\n\"The way the memo was worded and the reason it was retracted was because it was so broad that it appeared to impact everybody,\" Van Hollen responded.\nSen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) also attended Friday's Eastern Shore Delegation meeting. She explained to state senators and delegates her line of thinking when voting to confirm recent political appointees, emphasizing that she is prepared to vote on \"qualified\" candidates across party lines.\n\"My primary interest and sole interest, really, is making sure that I protect the interests of Maryland,\" Alsobrooks said.\nSUPERINTENDENTSEastern Shore superintendents gathered at the meeting Friday to provide legislative requests and recommendations.\nCaroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons, president of the Eastern Shore of Maryland Educational Consortium superintendents' group, framed Friday's discussion around The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education funding initiative.\nIt comes as Gov. Wes Moore (D) and the state legislature attempt to balance a $3 billion state deficit, in part by making cuts to education funding.\nDorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson explained the importance for districts to attract a diverse and qualified teacher workforce. However, state requirements, such as teacher salary minimums, sometimes bring about challenges.\n\"It is not good for a district, especially like mine, since we don't have the funding that other districts have,\" Thompson said.\nQueen Anne's County Public Schools Superintendent Patty Saelens said the Eastern Shore superintendents don't support Moore's proposed funding cuts to teacher collaborative time (out-of-classroom time to grade and plan) and community school initiatives.\n\"Our number one priority right now that we just can't support is literal cuts to our budget, specifically as it relates to the collaborative time and the community schools,\" Saelens said. \"Those are two major things that will negatively impact our overall state support.\"\nEDUCATIONRepresentatives from colleges and universities attended Friday's meeting, including Chesapeake College President Clifford Coppersmith and Washington College President Mike Sosulski.\nSosulski provided an update on Washington College's Innovation Plant Project, which is a project the institution is collaborating with Chesapeake College on.\n\"In the year-and-a-half of its development, it's already garnered $3 million in public and private funding to support it,\" Sosulski said.\nSosulski added that he hopes the Maryland Sellinger Grant Program, which provides independent colleges and universities with state funding, isn't slashed.\n\"I can't tell you how important Sellinger has been to making a Washington College education affordable and accessible to all Maryland residents,\" he said. \"It is really, and quite literally, the difference for many, many of our students and their ability to achieve the kind of education that we can provide.\"\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) asked about whether universities are considering raising tuition due to potential state funding cuts.\n\"We fully understand the need for the governor to cut the budget,\" said University of Maryland Eastern Shore President Heidi Anderson. \"We will not be looking at increasing tuition for our students, and we will abide by that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From crushes to banning cell phones — Maryland lawmakers propose new legislation covering range of issues\n\n February 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 654\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Maryland state senators and delegates have introduced a variety of bills in the 2024 legislative session, addressing issues ranging from state symbols and education mandates to law enforcement policy and budget concerns.State Symbols and Utility RegulationsState Sen. Steve Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) has introduced Senate Bill 562, which would designate the original Maryland Orange Crush as the state cocktail. The bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Wicomico, Worcester).\nHershey also sponsored Senate Bill 561, which, along with House Bill 227 sponsored by Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), would allow electric cooperatives to use unclaimed funds only to assist cooperative members or donate to nonprofit organizations, rather than treating them as abandoned property.\nAdditionally, Hershey introduced Senate Bill 355, seeking to delay the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program by two years.\nEnergy and Education LegislationDel. Jeff Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) is behind two bills on solar energy regulation: House Bill 739 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 478) and House Bill 742. One bill would prohibit the use of eminent domain for solar siting, while the other would return control over solar development to county governments.\nGhrist also introduced House Bill 736, which seeks to remove the mandate requiring local school systems to offer pre-kindergarten for three-year-olds. Another provision in the bill would increase state funding to help Kent County construct a new middle school.\nOn law enforcement, Ghrist is supporting a bill — potentially House Bill 122 — that would require the removal of unfounded complaints from police personnel files.\nNursing, Historic Preservation, and Cemetery ProtectionsDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) has proposed House Bill 602 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 407), directing the State Board of Nursing to negotiate reciprocity agreements with neighboring states for advanced practice nursing licensure. Another measure, House Bill 616 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 421), would extend the statute of limitations for crimes related to cemetery destruction and prohibit damaging cemetery landscaping. The bill is co-sponsored by Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico).\nHutchinson is also behind House Bill 760, which would establish a local appeals process for Maryland Historic Trust decisions.\nBudget Deficit Shifts to CountiesGov. Wes Moore's proposed budget shifts some of the state's structural deficit onto county governments. Ghrist criticized the move, stating that counties did not contribute to the deficit but are now being forced to compensate for state overspending.\n\"For my district, $720,000 will be shifted to Caroline County on top of an additional $1.8 million more that the county will have to add to education under Kirwan mandates,\" Ghrist stated. He cited similar financial burdens for other Eastern Shore counties, including Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne's.\n\"This will stifle economic growth because people will be sending more of their hard-earned money to the government rather than spending it in their local economies,\" Ghrist added.\nLaw Enforcement and Traffic StopsA controversial proposal, Senate Bill 292, has drawn strong opposition from law enforcement officials, including Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker. The bill would reclassify certain primary traffic offenses as secondary offenses, preventing law enforcement from stopping drivers solely for those violations.\n\"These minor traffic violations could actually lead to catching suspects that have committed serious felonies, recovering firearms, and stopping drug-related crimes,\" Baker said. A hearing on the bill is scheduled before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee.\nOther Bills of Local InterestHouse Bill 28, sponsored by Del. Josh Bouchat (R-Carroll, Frederick), proposes a constitutional amendment requiring all Maryland counties to adopt a charter government structure.\nHouse Bill 278, also from Bouchat, would provide an income tax subtraction modification for enhanced agricultural management equipment to support sustainable farming practices.\nHouse Bill 192, introduced by Del. Nino Mangione (R-Baltimore County), aims to curb student cell phone use in schools under the proposed \"No Distracted Learning Act.\"\nAs these bills move through the legislature, local officials and residents will have the opportunity to voice their support or concerns during committee hearings and public forums. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County and DCPS working to reduce FY26 budget deficits\n\n March 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 573\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Dorchester County Manager Jerry Jones considers the fiscal year 2026 budget a moving target.\"There are a lot of things that are changing,\" he said about predicted state funding during a Dorchester County Council budget work session Thursday. \"This is not a weekly thing, but almost a daily thing. ... We just don't know how this is going to unfold.\"\nCounty staff has been going through the operating and capital budgets line by line to find efficiencies, Jones said.\n\"We are constantly working on solutions,\" he said. \"We're finding those efficiencies. We have made substantial changes already.\"\nDuring the work session, Jones detailed estimated revenue and expenditures for fiscal year 2026. According to Jones' presentation, preliminary projections for the budget show a deficit of $6.2 million, with $87.7 million in estimated revenue and $93.9 million in estimated expenditures.\nJones outlined a list of mandates from the state that contribute to the county's deficit. These include reductions in grant funding, losses from proposed property tax deductions, an increase in state education maintenance of effort costs and increased financial responsibilities for things like teacher retirement.\nBoth Jones and County Council members said the budget would look a lot different without these mandates. Jones said that without the mandates, the county would not be facing a deficit. He said the county would instead have had $200,812 more in revenue than expenditures.\nThe council and county manager also talked about significant budget cuts made two years ago. Council Vice President Mike Detmer said the fat had already been trimmed from the budget at that time.\n\"At this point, we're trying to keep the ship from sinking,\" he said.\nCouncil President Lenny Pfeffer said he and Detmer have plans to go to Annapolis to testify in front of the Maryland General Assembly on legislation that would negatively affect the county's budget.\nEDUCATION FUNDING\nDetmer said the decrease in state funding and increase in the county's fiscal responsibility is largely driven by the state's goal to meet its financial obligation to the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a state plan that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education.\nDorchester County Public Schools, which has its own budget separate from the county, also is facing a deficit. The deficit, which was estimated to be $10.19 million in January, is now estimated to be $5.59 million.\nDuring a Dorchester County Board of Education budget work session also held Thursday, Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson shared refinements the district has made to the budget since the board's work session in January.\nHe said the $4.6 million in additional cuts to reduce the deficit were made through reductions to alternative education programming, supplies costs, travel costs, contracted services and fixed charges as well as expanding the district's understanding of Blueprint guidance to better match funding with expenses.\n\"We are taking it serious, and we are trying to make the changes we can to reduce our budget in a smart way,\" Thompson said.\nAt the County Council work session, council member Ricky Travers said other counties are having the same budget problems.\n\"Rural Maryland is the worst right now because the bigger counties, you just add another zero to it, but they've got a little bit more ability to garnish more money per penny (on taxes),\" he said. \"But this big number is astronomical.\"\nJones said the county will play it by ear on when it holds its next budget work session. He said when it is held will be announced to the public. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

County officials say they've heard for years about the need for new lights.\nThe project will cost $817,000, just over half of a total $1.5 million to be pulled from the county's capital projects fund. Talbot County's fiscal year 2025 budget has already accounted for the costs.\n\"That's huge for the auditorium,\" County Council President Chuck Callahan said. \"So I'm glad that went through. That's going to be big for the school.\"\nCouncil members also unanimously approved $556,000 for light replacements at St. Michaels Middle High School and $116,000 for athletic field improvements across the district.\nFollowing those approvals, the County Council passed a bill permitting the county's sale of bonds to borrow $26.9 million for Chapel District Elementary School renovations. That funding from the county spans both fiscal years 2025 and 2026.\nThe renovation project, which broke ground last August, will upgrade the existing building and add on an additional 16,000 square feet. Chapel Elementary was last renovated in 1994.\nCallahan said Talbot County Public Schools Director of Operations Kevin Shafer has done a \"phenomenal job\" leading renovation efforts.\n\"You've done excellent keeping us up to speed and everything, and trying to keep everything on budget,\" Callahan said. \"We really, really appreciate it.

    "content": "Talbot County provides first look at draft budget for FY26\n\n March 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 474\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot County Manager Clay Stamp said one aspect was clear when drafting the county's fiscal year 2026 budget: it needed to remain flat.Speaking with the Talbot County Council at a workshop Tuesday, county employees presented a balanced draft budget coming in at $163.3 million. It comes in slightly below last year's budget of $163.8 million.\nThe county's total budget has ballooned in recent years. In fiscal year 2023, it was $112 million, and one year later, it rose to $128 million. It took a sharper jump to the $163 million mark last year.\nStamp said the increases were for good cause. \"You've made incredible and important investments in public safety and education,\" he told council members.\nBut Stamp emphasized that given federal uncertainties, state cost shifts and recurring county costs, it is important to curb that recent upward trend.\n\"That was a mandate as we put this budget together,\" Stamp said of the belt-tightening.\nStamp said the draft fiscal year 2026 budget currently proposes no additional job positions. The county's capital improvement plan is also trimmed back, he said. He hopes the county can focus on finishing projects already underway, such as Chapel District Elementary School renovations and a new EMS station in Cordova.\nWhen drafting the budget, Stamp and Finance Director Martha Sparks said they initially came in $6 million over their target. To remedy that, they're proposing delayed payments for postemployment benefits and correctional officers' retirements, respectively — the latter of which is to be expected to be included in fiscal year 2027.\nSparks mentioned that tax hikes proposed at the state level for wealthy individuals may have an impact on Talbot County revenues. Sparks said last time a similar tax increase was levied in 2009, it made a significant dent, partly due to the recession.\n\"We had an exodus of the wealthy in our county as a result of that,\" Sparks said. \"And it took us approximately 10 years to recover.\"\nSparks added, however, that the county looks OK for fiscal year 2026 in terms of those tax proposals. She said she's \"not sure what that will look like for us moving forward.\"\nAs for policy and funding shifts at the federal level, Stamp said \"it's reasonable\" to expect impacts will trickle down to Talbot County.\n\"We are cognizant of that,\" Stamp said. \"Radars are up, antennas are up. We're watching closely.\"\nThe draft budget shows $55 million in funding for the Talbot Board of Education. Stamp said the county must contribute that mark since it's required by state funding formulas. Any additional education funding is left for the County Council to consider in the coming weeks.\nCouncil members and staff will hold a number of workshops this month and in April before a budget proposal is officially introduced April 15.\nPublic budget hearings are scheduled for May 6, and the County Council is expected to enact a budget ordinance May 27. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The school's budget is $1.31 million higher than its fiscal year 2025 budget.\nPart of the $9.02 million budget request included a $952,560 request for the design of a new technical building. Chesapeake College Vice President for Administrative Services Karen Smith said the new building will have areas for a variety of programs, including agriculture, electrical, welding and fabrication, construction trades and advanced manufacturing. She said the cost for the design phase could be lower depending on state approval.\nAlthough the five counties approved the request for funding for the design, the decision came with a shift in contributions toward the project.\nDorchester County's share of costs for the design phase will be taken on by Queen Anne's County. This means Queen Anne's County's responsibility for the project will jump from 28.9%, or an estimated $275,290, to 47.8%, or an estimated $455,324.\nDuring the meeting, Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer and Vice President Mike Detmer outlined their council's concerns regarding paying for the project.\nAlthough other counties hope to use the new technical building for career and technical education at the high school level, Dorchester County has a career and technology center it is still paying off, they said.\nThrough its budget process, Dorchester County has struggled to eliminate an estimated $6.2 million deficit.\nPfeffer said Dorchester County takes in about $45 million in property and income taxes and will have to give Dorchester County Public Schools $26.6 million for fiscal year 2026.\n\"So we're trying to run the rest of the county on half of that,\" he said. \"So while in conceptual context, we believe in the project, fiscally our citizens and our staff are saying we don't know how we're going to be able to participate.\"\nAt the Chesapeake College meeting, Queen Anne's County Commissioner Jack Wilson Jr. shared his county's decision to cover Dorchester County for the project design costs.\n\"We all know what happens if we let this money go back to the state,\" Wilson said. \"It's going to go somewhere else in this state, and it's not going to be here. We got this far. And Lenny, listen, I feel for you guys. I know what you're going through. But I think we just need to keep it on the rails at least through the design phase and see what the state's going to help with.\"\nAccording to documents from the meeting, the state will support 75% of project costs, and the counties will support the remaining 25%.\nAfter the counties voted to approve the amended capital budget, Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian said he understands the position Dorchester County is in, mentioning the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and \"unfunded mandates\" by the state.\n\"I think we all understand any one of us could be in your same position very easily,\" Fithian told the Dorchester County Council members. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County makes its way through grueling budget process\n\n April 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Over the past four months, an atmosphere of concern, frustration and, at times, despair has colored budget meetings in Dorchester County.In mid-April, the Dorchester County Council introduced a $91.96 million proposed operating budget for fiscal year 2026 with proposals to increase taxes. The introduction came after months of work by county staff to eliminate an estimated $6.2 million deficit.\nAt the same time, Dorchester County Public Schools has been working to eliminate a multi-million dollar deficit of its own. At an April budget work session, DCPS Superintendent Jymil Thompson said the district is still $5.59 million in the hole. The district hopes to eliminate the deficit by the Board of Education's May meeting.\nTo balance and pass these budgets, difficult decisions — like the school district canceling summer school for 2025 and the county increasing 911 fees from $1.50 to $4.25 — have already been made.\n\"We hate to have to put any of this on the backs of our citizens, but these are state laws that are being passed down as a bandaid for us to pay,\" County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said in an interview with The Star Democrat. \"And unfortunately we're having to pass it down onto our citizens because we have no other revenue to pay these bills.\"\nWHAT MAKES FY26 DIFFERENT\nDorchester County's proposed operating budget is $10 million more than the fiscal year 2025 budget passed last May. County Manager Jerry Jones said the increases are in part due to new education requirements from the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education plan.\nJones said another reason the county has had to increase spending include cost shifts from the state to the county for things like teacher pensions.\nIn an effort to lessen budget costs, the county sought a waiver for the maintenance of effort for education, which is a law that requires counties to provide as much funding per pupil as was provided in the previous fiscal year. But with a narrow window between the state passing a budget and the waiver's due date, the county had to ask for an extension, which was denied.\n\"It's disappointing,\" Jones said. \"But at the end of the day, we've got to keep moving forward.\"\nThompson said Blueprint requirements, like increasing teacher starting salaries, are part of the reason why the school district's budget — which is separate from the county's — has been difficult to balance this year. He said inflation and recurring program costs have also hindered the process.\n\"No decision is easy,\" he said. \"But I think we're all trying to make the best decision for our students.\"\nBoth Jones and Thompson said they don't see the annual budget process getting easier any time soon. Jones said he doesn't see things getting easier unless change is made at the state level.\n\"I don't see (the budget) easing up in years to come unless some big changes are considered at the general assembly and future sessions,\" he said. \"We'll see how it plays out.\"\nTAX DIFFERENTIALS\nOne of the proposed changes to balance the county's budget is to remove the tax differential, or lower property tax rate, for Cambridge and Hurlock. This would mean Cambridge and Hurlock residents would have to pay the full property tax rate.\nCambridge Mayor Lajan Cephas said although the county is trying its best to balance the budget, she believes this measure is unfair to Cambridge residents. She said the tax differential essentially returns money to tax payers for \"duplicated\" services.\nCephas also said Cambridge is growing, which will increase the tax base and bring in more revenue for the county. She said the county should instead look into raising taxes in unincorporated areas that are \"a little bit better off.\"\nJones said he doesn't know what the final budget will look like, but said the council welcomes input.\n\"We want people to come forward and contribute to this conversation,\" he said.\nAdoption of Dorchester County's budget is slated for May 20. The county's first public budget hearing will be held May 6.\nThompson said the Dorchester County Board of Education has to pass the budget by the end of June, but he hopes the board will pass the budget in May to give staff time to make necessary preparations. \n\n Copyright  2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County OKs $161 million budget\n\n May 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 685\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot County made good on its promise to deliver a flat, conservative budget for fiscal year 2026. The County Council unanimously passed a $161.1 million spending plan Tuesday.It comes in at nearly $3 million under last year's budget amid what County Manager Clay Stamp calls \"uncharted waters.\"\n\"The economic landscape out there is a bumpy ride right now,\" Stamp said. \"This year, we knew that we needed to flatten the budget out, we needed to live within our means.\"\nStamp and other officials have emphasized Talbot County's continued financial commitments toward public safety, whether through capital projects such as an EMS station in Cordova or support for correctional officers.\nIn a draft version of the budget that only received a few adjustments Tuesday, the council is expected to allocate the following funds for public safety:\n$11.5 million for emergency medical services.$10.5 million for the Talbot County Sheriff's Office.$7.6 million for the Department of Corrections.$5.4 million for emergency management.$3.3 million for volunteer fire departments.\nCouncil members thanked Stamp, Finance Director Martha Sparks and Assistant Finance Director Kaitlin Foster-Clark for their work during the budget process.\n\"This was the most challenging budget that I've ever sat through,\" council member Keasha Haythe said. \"The decisions were very hard on some items.\"\n\"It was definitely a heavy lift this year, but everyone bucked down, and we made it happen here,\" council member Dave Stepp said.\nThe county's property tax rate will remain largely steady at 79 cents per $100 of assessed value, though residents will see a supplemental tax of just over 1 cent per $100 of value on their tax bills.\nEDUCATION FUNDING\nThat supplement stems from education funding OK'd by the county. While most line items were ironed out through deliberations, workshops and meetings, Tuesday's discussion centered on funding amendments for Talbot County Public Schools.\nThe budget already included $55 million in education funding as required by The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's initiative to fund and improve education. County Council members were left to consider how much the county would contribute above that mark.\nIn a 4-1 vote Tuesday, the council approved an additional $600,000 in funding for schools, aimed at filling nine positions, including multilingual and special education roles. Council member Lynn Mielke was the sole no vote.\nThe approved budget change came after an amendment to fulfill the district's entire $1.1 million request — which had been scaled back from $5.5 million earlier this budget cycle — failed narrowly. Vice President Pete Lesher and Haythe favored the $1.1 million, but President Chuck Callahan, Stepp and Mielke did not.\nLesher argued it is \"short-sighted\" to not fund the full request. He said it'd be prudent for the county to gradually increase its education funding as even higher Blueprint projections loom in future fiscal years.\n\"This would be a small step in that direction,\" Lesher said. \"And frankly, it will make next year, an election year, a lot easier for all of us up here.\"\n\"I think we should be going farther,\" he said of the $600,000 mark. \"But this goes some distance.\"\nCallahan sponsored the amendment to partially OK the district's request, citing the significant need for teachers. The $500,000 not approved by the council was requested by the district to increase teacher and instructional assistant salaries.\n\"I would ask that the school board use the money that we give you for (hiring) teachers,\" Callahan said. \"I would like to see that, and not for something else.\"\nMielke said she was initially on board with Callahan's amendment. But she said she needs \"more security\" that the district will put the $600,000 toward the nine positions.\n\"I'm not advised that it necessarily would be,\" Mielke said. \"So for that reason I couldn't support it.\"\nA spokesperson for Talbot County Public Schools said in a statement to The Star Democrat that the district stands behind the $1.1 million request but understands the \"challenges faced by council and staff in meeting the funding needs of Talbot County in these uncertain times.\"\n\"We are grateful for their support for educators' pensions and for the additional staff needed to serve our students,\" the statement read.\nThis story has been updated to include a statement from Talbot County Public Schools. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dorchester County's recommendations for 2026 do not differ too much.\nThe Dorchester County Council's five recommendations are:\nTo consider a pause or suspension of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future education plan to allow counties to catch up financially.To rethink or review existing rules or policies that override local control over solar energy regulations.To improve infrastructure related to transportation and water drainage in Dorchester County.To introduce an initiative regarding safety concerns of solar battery storage and concerns regarding the sufficiency of the decommissioning bond that covers the cost of removing solar infrastructure once it's no longer in use.To continue to reform juvenile justice. This recommendation came after a 15-year-old resident shot and killed another resident in the 900 block of Cornelia Street on June 8.\nCounty Council Vice President Mike Detmer said juvenile justice laws need serious reformation to make Dorchester County a safer place.\n\"Whether you're below 18 or over 18, you have to get some feedback for your actions,\" Detmer said. \"Your terrible actions aren't in a vacuum; we all live here.\"\nThe purpose of MACo's recommended initiatives is to address problems counties are facing with state legislators. County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said the organization collects concerns and information from counties to assist them in navigating the legislative process at the General Assembly.\nDetmer said that these initiatives don't always align with Dorchester County due to the county's unique set of problems, and this misalignment has caused some tension with the state. \"You know, things are complicated,\" he said. \"I would say the tension really stems from the policies and laws that the state is enacting.\"\nElected officials from Maryland's 23 counties and Baltimore City can submit legislative proposal initiatives on behalf of the county as an elected body, generally at an open meeting or via a voting process, or not on behalf of the county, but as an individual.\nNominations can be submitted online through June 27 on the MACo website. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The other location, near the county sheriff's office on Double Hills Road, presents several challenges, Porter said.\n\"I think at this point I would like to say that I am in favor of the North Carolina location as opposed to being built in town,\" Porter said.\nCommissioners Frank Bartz agreed with Porter and cited traffic and safety concerns on Route 404.\nThe commissioners also had discussions about the school's location at their meeting two weeks ago.\nAt that meeting, County Administrator Kathleen Freeman presented the two location options. Commissioners President Travis Breeding sparked a conversation about how much sway the commissioners have over the school's location.\n\"How much influence do the commissioners actually have over where the school gets constructed?\" Breeding asked two weeks ago. \"As part of the funding of this, other than a survey, we haven't really been consulted.\"\nBreeding then explained the issues they would run into with each potential location.\n\"From what I gather, it seemed like a lot of people really preferred the Double Hills location. But, with Double Hills, we've got to work out a ton of details with the Town of Denton as far as sewer, water allocation for that to work, potentially pump station upgrades,\" Breeding said.\nHe then mentioned traffic issues on Route 404 with beach traffic towards the end of the school year and students from northern county towns like Marydale, who would have to take the bus a long distance to the potential Double Hills location.\nPorter, said he didn't recall that \"the county did not have a lot of input\" on the design of new county buildings in the past.\nFreeman assured Breeding that the county will be involved with the full feasibility study for both sites to determine which site makes the most sense.\nBreeding also brought forward discussion of how much influence the commissioners will have for the design of the school.\n\"Then also, how much input do we have over the the design?\" Breeding asked. \"I mean, we don't want a situation where we're building something that's way more expensive than it needs to be or making it as functional as we can and keeping the cost as low as we can.\"\nBartz raised an issue where if the county has to build a new detention center, a school on the Double Hills Road site would cause a problem. The Caroline County Sheriff's Office is located near that Double Hills Road site, making the location logical for a detention center, he said.\nThe county is in talks with Queen Anne's County about a new 388-bed regional detention center that would house all Caroline, Queen Anne's and Kent county prisoners. After conversations about control and cost of the center, discussions between the three counties have slowed down.\nLockerman name\nPorter pointed out conversation that are being had about the Lockerman's name staying at the location of the current building instead of being attached to the new school.\nThough the existing building will no longer be used as a school when the new school is built, Porter said he was in favor of keeping the Lockerman name attached to the facility in the interest of honoring its history.\n\"I think it's going to be important that the history of the school and the name of Lockerman be retained,\" he said. \"I don't know what the future use is going to be for that building, but it's important, I think, from the alumni standpoint, from the community standpoint, that the history be be kept there for whatever use is going to be done in the future.\"\nBreeding suggested drafting a letter of intent to the Caroline County Board of Education stating that it would be the commissioners' intention to retain the name of the building. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hignutt and Simmons explained multiple numbers within their budget including increasing administrators salaries to become competitive with neighboring counties. The commissioners also discussed Lockerman Middle School and the potential new location. Simmons said the Board of Education will keep a close working relationship with the commissioners throughout the process.Lori Bishop and Charlotte Brown provided an update on the addition to 4-H Park. The addition is almost complete, but the bathrooms failed inspection due to sinks being too tall and toilets being to far from the wall.Daniel Fox discussed Opioid Settlement Fund with the county commissioners. The county received $358,000 in local direct payments and $515,000 in target aid grants for opioid settlement. The county plans to talk with other departments and agencies to see how the fund will properly assist on a one-time basis.The county conducted the second reading and public hearing for an emergency bill on wastewater treatment facilities. The bill will allow for non-accessory wastewater treatment facilities to be permitted by special use exception, provided the facilities hold MDE discharge permits for five years and the proposed application is similar to the previous application. The Planning Commission had a positive recommendation. The commissioners moved the discussion to a third reading at their next meeting.During the county administration report, Kathleen Freeman told the commissioners about a conversation she had with Robbie Gill about a new YMCA in Caroline County. The commissioners are adamant about getting a new YMCA in Caroline County and believe the conversations need to turn into building.",

After the discussion the commissioners talked about Lockerman Middle School and the next steps.\n\"I think it'd be good for us to say that we are working together on the Lockerman Middle School construction,\" Commissioners President Travis Breeding said. \"We were asking questions about what role the commissioners officially play in siting and construction, they were just questions that we were asking. It wasn't like the Board of Ed's going to run all over us and make crazy stupid decisions and we're going to be stuck with it. It was just what influence do we have over the process.\"\nBreeding explained the consensus the commissioners have come to on their personal choice for the new school location.\n\"I think we talked about it, and our consensus is that the most logical place to put it is probably next to North Carolina High School for us,\" Breeding said. \"We understand that there's a whole process that has to be going through, fact finding, the Board of Ed will review that and make their decisions based off of that. But we were just saying that that questioning what influence we actually had over the process.\"\nSimmons clarified they understand the commissioners wanting understanding of their role and told the commissioners how the process will go.\n\"Board of Education selects the site,\" Simmons said. \"The feasibility study, which was presented to the board on July 1st, indicated North Caroline High School was the better of the two locations. We did review the two sites that we were asked to review that were basically the county-owned, which is cost efficient way to do it.\nSimmons said the board received the feasibility study that night and should be making its decision on a site at the August meeting. He added the site selection does not include picking what the design of the building will be.\nAfter looking over potential designs for the new Lockerman Middle School, Breeding suggested having athletic facilities have their own location and not sharing fields.\n\"One of the major things that stuck out with me was, relocating the athletic facilities around there,\" Breeding said. \"If we can get dedicated facilities so we're not sharing space like we have been doing forever, where lacrosse or soccer is using the outfield of the softball and the baseball field, if we can actually get dedicated space, that would be a priority of mine.\"\nHe noted that facilities in surrounding counties should be studied.\n\"We've got one bite at the apple here, let's get it right,\" Breeding said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From crushes to banning cell phones — Maryland lawmakers propose new legislation covering range of issues\n\nFebruary 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\nAuthor/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@chespub.com | Section: News\n\n636 Words\n\nRead News Document\n\nANNAPOLIS – Maryland state senators and delegates have introduced a variety of bills in the 2024 legislative session, addressing issues ranging from state symbols and education mandates to law enforcement policy and budget concerns.State Symbols and Utility Regulations\nState Sen. Steve Hershey (R-36) has introduced Senate Bill 562, which would designate the original Maryland Orange Crush as the state cocktail. The bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Johnny Mautz (R-37) and Mary Beth Carozza (R-38).\nHershey also sponsored Senate Bill 561, which, along with House Bill 227 sponsored by Del. Chris Adams (R-37B), would allow electric cooperatives to use unclaimed funds only to assist cooperative members or donate to nonprofit organizations, rather than treating them as abandoned property.\nAdditionally, Hershey introduced Senate Bill 355, seeking to delay the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program by two years.\nEnergy and Education Legislation\nDel. Jeff Ghrist (R-36) is behind two bills on solar energy regulation: House Bill 739 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 478) and House Bill 742. One bill would prohibit the use of eminent domain for solar siting, while the other would return control over solar development to county governments.\nGhrist also introduced House Bill 736, which seeks to remove the mandate requiring local school systems to offer pre-kindergarten for three-year-olds. Another provision in the bill would increase state funding to help Kent County construct a new middle school.\nOn law enforcement, Ghrist is supporting a bill — potentially House Bill 122 — that would require the removal of unfounded complaints from police personnel files.\nNursing, Historic Preservation, and Cemetery Protections\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-37B) has proposed House Bill 602 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 407), directing the State Board of Nursing to negotiate reciprocity agreements with neighboring states for advanced practice nursing licensure. Another measure, House Bill 616 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 421), would extend the statute of limitations for crimes related to cemetery destruction and prohibit damaging cemetery landscaping. The bill is co-sponsored by Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-37A).\nHutchinson is also behind House Bill 760, which would establish a local appeals process for Maryland Historic Trust decisions.\nBudget Deficit Shifts to Counties\nGov. Wes Moore's proposed budget shifts some of the state's structural deficit onto county governments. Del. Jeff Ghrist (R-36) criticized the move, stating that counties did not contribute to the deficit but are now being forced to compensate for state overspending.\n\"For my district, $720,000 will be shifted to Caroline County on top of an additional $1.8 million more that the county will have to add to education under Kirwan mandates,\" Ghrist stated. He cited similar financial burdens for other Eastern Shore counties, including Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne's.\n\"This will stifle economic growth because people will be sending more of their hard-earned money to the government rather than spending it in their local economies,\" Ghrist added.\nLaw Enforcement and Traffic Stop Restrictions\nA controversial proposal, Senate Bill 292, has drawn strong opposition from law enforcement officials, including Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker. The bill would reclassify certain primary traffic offenses as secondary offenses, preventing law enforcement from stopping drivers solely for those violations.\n\"These minor traffic violations could actually lead to catching suspects that have committed serious felonies, recovering firearms, and stopping drug-related crimes,\" Baker said. A hearing on the bill is scheduled before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee.\nOther Bills of Local Interest\nHouse Bill 28, sponsored by Del. Josh Bouchat (R-5), proposes a constitutional amendment requiring all Maryland counties to adopt a charter government structure.\nHouse Bill 278, also from Bouchat, would provide an income tax subtraction modification for enhanced agricultural management equipment to support sustainable farming practices.\nHouse Bill 192, introduced by Del. Nino Mangione (R-42A), aims to curb student cell phone use in schools under the proposed \"No Distracted Learning Act.\"\nAs these bills move through the legislature, local officials and residents will have the opportunity to voice their support or concerns during committee hearings and public forums.\n\n© Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore (D) had to reckon with closing a $3 billion gap in the state's fiscal year 2026 budget.\nSome savings came through cost shifts placing more burden on county governments, the MACo leaders said. But they added that the upcoming 2026 session, and the fiscal year 2027 budget that goes along with it, likely won't be as dire.\n\"Relatively calm, probably not a big crisis,\" Sanderson said of his projection for this year's session, which officially kicks off Jan. 14 in Annapolis.\nHe said the large budgetary concerns are likely to reappear in 2027 as legislators put together a plan for fiscal year 2028.\n\"The story from last year is gonna repeat itself, but with a year off,\" Sanderson predicted.\nSpecifically, the executive director said Maryland's expansive education funding formula, The Blueprint, will influence the 2027 session. And in the short-term, some counties are already coming to grips with increasing cost shares for education.\n\"Every county is either in the midst or a year or two away from seeing a year where the increase in school spending required under Blueprint requires all the money or even more money than your county's likely to gain in revenue for that year,\" Sanderson said. \"It's an obvious squeeze at the local level.\"\nTalbot County's fiscal year 2026 budget included $55 million in education funding required by The Blueprint's formulas. On top of that, the council approved an additional $600,000 in funding to fill new positions.\nThat mark had been scaled back twice from the original ask the Talbot Board of Education made of the council — first requesting $5.5 million in supplementary funds, then $1.1 million.\nCounty Council Vice President Pete Lesher, who supported the district's $1.1 million request earlier this year, said it was \"short-sighted\" for the county to only fund the district's request partially, given that Blueprint requirements are only set to increase in future years. But other council members opted to hold back on dedicating the full request as the county aimed to even out its spending hikes seen in years prior.\nSanderson said on Tuesday that housing legislation will be at the forefront this winter. Recently, Moore signed an executive order that aims to speed up the permitting and building of affordable housing projects.\n\"I anticipate that being a big fight,\" Sanderson said. \"Whether it's a big fight in the more rural jurisdictions is yet to be seen.\"\nCouncil Member Lynn Mielke asked how Easton fits into state plans to tackle the housing issue.\nSanderson said there's an opportunity for MACo to advocate for provisions so a potential housing package doesn't \"overwhelm\" local jurisdictions. He said the association can help push for certain changes to help counties and towns that lack authority in certain areas, such as the variation of impact fees on developers.\n\"At the same time, we generally want to keep land use decisions local,\" he added. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The incident involved three students and one staff member and ended with a student being transported to a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.According to a press release released by the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, the assault happened on Tuesday afternoon. The videos paint a picture of the incident, though no further official statement has been released by law enforcement on the assault.\nIn the videos, a group of students are circling around the three students involved in the assault. Seconds into the video, one student in a black hoodie moves toward a student in a red hoodie and assaults him. The student in red falls to the floor. Immediately following, an additional student in a gray hoodie proceeds to join in the assault.\nIn the video, a male staff member in a white shirt attempts to protect the student that is being assaulted and physically puts his body on top of the student, seemingly to act as a barrier between the students.\nThe other two students seemingly continue to assault the student in red and begin to also assault the staff member. Soon after, other staff members intervene and separate the students and defuse the situation. The incident lasted around 30 seconds.\nDeputies were able to identify two victims of the assault, one was an Easton High School staff member and the second was a student of the school. No identities have been released, and the incident is currently under investigation.\nThe assault resulted in one student being transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton via Talbot County Department of Emergency Services to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\nThe two other students in the video were identified and arrested in relation to the assault.\nAccording to a statement from Debbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools, the event is being evaluated and those involved will face appropriate disciplinary action.\n\"The safety of our students and staff is always our top priority. We are grateful for our partnership with the Talbot County Sheriff's Office and the presence of School Resource Officers in our schools,\" the statement said. \"Deputy Horseman, along with several other Sheriff's deputies and members of the Easton High staff responded quickly to contain the incident. The students involved will face appropriate disciplinary action, and we are continuously evaluating safety measures to prevent or mitigate incidents of this nature.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said all school resource officers in the district are aware of the threat, and extra deputies are patrolling.\nOn Friday, TCPS students were put in a modified lockdown following a threatening social media post made that morning. According to the Sheriff's Office, the threat originated outside of the United States and similar threats were made to schools in Easton, Pennsylvania.\nGamble said the Sheriff's officer is aware of jurisdictions in other states that \"have had 40 or 50 of these types of threats.\"\n\"It's happening all over our country where, for whatever reason, somebody is trying to disrupt school operations and put our kids in fear,\" he said.\nGamble said that a few years back, the district experienced something similar where about half a dozen non-specific threats were made during the course of the school year. He said he would expect to see more of these threats this year.\n\"This just seems like the thing to do these days for some reason,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Resource officers already serving the school district fall under the direction and budget of the county sheriff's office.\nThe statewide grant funding assists in supplementing law enforcement coverage for public schools with $10 to 15 million in FY26 and $20 million in FY27 and each year thereafter, he said.\nAs school security is considered a top state priority, a minimum three years of funding following this year is secured, according to Saboury.\n\"So really that's putting additional eyes and ears in our schools, which is a wonderful thing,\" he said.\nAs a member of the district, the SSE works more closely with school leaders on safety measures, often outside law enforcement scopes, and are more closely involved with student behavior, support and providing intervention to mitigate and prevent harm, he said.\nAs district employees, QACPS has the flexibility to utilize SSEs for after school sporting events or field trips Saboury said.\n\"It's a great resource that the school district has never had before,\" he said.\nSSEs are held to the same standards and certification programs through the Maryland for School Safety Model training as SROs.\nTraining, uniforms, equipment and overtime are all budgeted into the grant with no cost the district, he said.\nWith the potential for increased funding down the road, Saboury was hopeful to be able to build the program and continually create a safe learning environment for students. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat.

Kenny Tull led a drill Thursday afternoon, showing me just how critical it is that first responders from different counties to work together cohesively under stress.\nAnd the results were enlightening: officers and EMTs didn't always make the correct decision every split-second, but they did confer with each other on what steps to take during the next drill, learning how to get better along the way.\nTo learn more about the training, read my story below.

Officers entered the school to take down a mock shooter. They joined with paramedics and EMTs to locate mock students in classrooms, assess their injuries and evacuate them from the building in a safe manner.\nResponders often communicated with one another on how to follow the proper incident command tactics, at times acknowledging the improvements they could make to their decisions during the drill. Caroline County Cpl. Kenny Tull said the drills will help improve all aspects of emergency response if a school shooting occurs on the Mid-Shore.\n\"It's a learning experience for everyone,\" Tull said.\nIn previous years, active shooter training took place at schools in Talbot and Caroline counties.\nRecently, the drills have included a team of both law enforcement and EMS personnel called the Rescue Task Force. Once a hallway or area is cleared, officers will protect unarmed EMTs and paramedics in \"warm zones,\" where danger may still exist even if the main threat is eliminated.\nThat practice is life-saving in a real situation, Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said.\n\"Before, (EMS personnel) didn't go in until the building got cleared, which caused more deaths,\" he said. \"The quicker we can get treatment for people, the quicker we can get paramedics in there with us, the more people that hopefully will survive.\"\nStill, the top priority is eliminating the shooter or main threat.\n\"The initial driving force is stop the killing, because the statistics will show you that an assailant can kill more people than you can treat,\" Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey said.\n\"Their driving force is stop the dying,\" Lowrey said of EMTs and paramedics. \"You toggle between those two driving forces.\"\nGamble said first responders have taken FEMA-required incident command training, which serves as a common baseline for members of different agencies.\n\"A lot of this stuff spawned out of 9/11, getting fire, police, paramedics everybody on the same page. Square up communications,\" Gamble said.\nHaving so many agencies on hand Thursday was an opportunity for first responders to acclimate with one another and become more comfortable working together during an emergency response, agency leaders said.\nCaroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker emphasized that local agencies already share a solid rapport.\n\"You'd be surprised how much there is interaction between counties and agencies,\" Baker said.\nPlus, the geography of Mid-Shore counties sometimes means Caroline County police may be first on the scene to a Talbot County emergency, or vice versa.\n\"For something that happens at Preston Elementary, Talbot County will be the first ones there,\" Talbot County Maj. Steve Elliott said. \"If something happens at Chapel Elementary, Caroline County will be the first ones there.\"\nTina Kintop, EMS division chief for the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services, said it's most important for EMTs and paramedics to be disciplined and properly trained to participate in the rescue task force with police.\nOn Thursday, the drills didn't stop when the mock shooter went down. First responders secured students, assessed the severity of their injuries and evacuated them from the building. The job doesn't end there, Kintop said.\nPolice and EMS focus on locating a site for reunification of families. Gamble said different schools already have plans in place for reunification spots, some of which have been used for fire drills or bomb threats in the past.\nBy practicing these processes Thursday, agencies worked to create a streamlined plan they hope they will never have to use.\n\"It's all about organization and accountability,\" Kintop said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Before it was over, Phillips said several deputies and school staff were assaulted, and one staff member was taken to the hospital. Phillips did not disclose the extent of their injuries, but he said that everyone was going to be OK.\nThe school safety monitor received multiple blows to the head and was held down on the floor, and three deputies were spat on by students, Phillips said.\n\"That's a biological thing, you just don't know what you're dealing with, now they have to get tests done,\" Phillips said.\nPhillips said the incident was prompted by something that happened outside of school.

Peter and Paul Elementary\n\n September 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A woman is being held at the Talbot County Detention Center after being accused of spray-painting graffiti around town, including at Sts. Peter and Paul Elementary School.Sian Radaskiewicz-King, 32, was arrested Friday by Easton police on charges of malicious destruction of property and use of a hate symbol. She was later charged with defacing religious property and disturbing school operations, among other counts.\nAccording to court documents, King allegedly spray-painted the transgender symbol on dumpsters, the sidewalk and a step outside the Catholic school off of Route 50. Other spray-painted symbols were found on a fence at the Hampton Inn next to the school, per court records.\nThe symbols were found elsewhere in town, including outside East End Liquors, The Market at Dover Station and other businesses. The transgender symbol, often used to encourage gender inclusivity, is a combination of the male and female signs.\nAt an unusually crowded bail hearing on Monday afternoon, Talbot County District Court Judge Karen Ketterman ordered King to be held without bond in the Detention Center. A trial is scheduled for Oct. 28.\nMany parents and school officials from Sts. Peter and Paul filled the courtroom. School Board Chair Peggy Wilson asked Ketterman to not approve King's release. Wilson cited the Aug. 27 shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, which killed two children and injured 18 people, as a reason why the school community is concerned for the safety of students.\n\"Our fear is not the symbol itself, but the possibility of a copycat situation,\" Wilson said.\nKing, according to public legal representation, is transgender. She previously attended Sts. Peter and Paul School.\nThe Minneapolis shooter, Robin Westman, was referred to as transgender by federal officials. Westman's gender identity wasn't clear, according to The Associated Press.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook said in a statement this weekend that the graffiti incidents are \"especially painful\" given the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting.\n\"It reminds us of the responsibility we all share to ensure our children's safety and well-being,\" Cook wrote. \"We condemn such acts of intimidation, they have no place in our community.\"\nIn a statement Sunday, the Delmarva Pride Center condemned the graffiti acts as a \"misuse\" of the international transgender symbol.\n\"We are deeply troubled that an LGBTQIA+ symbol was misused in a way that could be construed as hateful,\" the statement read. \"Symbols such as the Transgender Symbol exist to affirm identity, celebrate diversity, and foster belonging — not to spread fear or division.\n\"This incident occurs at a time when Transgender people continue to face targeted attacks in society. We call on our neighbors, allies, and community members to stand together, to reject hate in all its forms, and to embrace the values of acceptance, compassion, and love.\"\nOn Monday, Easton Police Deputy Chief Greg Wright said the agency will increase patrol this week at Sts. Peter and Paul School and other schools in town. He said police \"have no reason to believe that there was any attempt or desire to harm anyone.\"\nBOND DECISION\nBridgette Lane, an assistant at the Talbot County public defender's office, argued in court on Monday that King should be granted release based on the low severity of charges, an otherwise clean criminal record and the Detention Center's recommendation.\nLane said King has \"expressed remorse\" and understands \"she can't be acting out in these ways.\"\nKing, who is listed as having a Baltimore address, was recently staying in Easton with her mother, Lane said. If released, the expectation was for King to stay with her mother.\nTalbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said the graffiti incident is concerning due to the context of the Minneapolis shooting last month, as well as the fact that King's mother's house is close to the school.\n\"Here we have this clear warning sign,\" Coale said. \" ... We don't know if the defendant is capable of carrying out something worse. But the state doesn't want to find out.\"\nKetterman said both sides made good points, but she hammered home that there are \"no conditions of release\" that would ensure the safety of the community. The judge said she's concerned about the location of the graffiti and King's documented mental health diagnoses, which include bipolar disorder and PTSD.\n\"I don't think the court has another choice,\" Ketterman said after ruling no bond and ordering the defendant complete a mental health evaluation.\nInformation from The Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Phillips described the scene as a \"melee.\"\nPhillips said three sheriff's deputies were spat on and the school safety monitor was taken to the hospital. Two boys, ages 14 and 15, were arrested following the incident.\nThe 15-year-old boy, Jaheem Mortaz Brown, was released to his step-father's custody. Three days later, the Brown allegedly shot his step-father in the face. The extent of the step-father's injuries has not been disclosed.\nIn addition, Phillips said Cambridge police received a call this weekend that juveniles around 11 years old were shoplifting from the Wawa on Sunburst Highway.\n\"They're shoplifting because they know they (the juvenile system) can't do nothing with them,\" Phillips said.\nPhillips said the problem of juvenile crime will continue until the \"broken juvenile justice system\" is changed.\n\"The juvenile justice system in the state of Maryland is broken; it's not working,\" he said. \"We're not holding anybody accountable.\"\nThe former Secretary of the Department of Juvenile Services, Vincent Schiraldi received intense backlash from Mid-Shore sheriffs, including Phillips. The Maryland Sheriffs Association sent a letter to Gov. Wes Moore calling for Schiraldi's immediate resignation last year. Schiraldi stepped down from the position in June.\n\"Consistently in Maryland, juveniles have been charged with serious violent crimes,\" the letter states, \"only to be turned right back over to a parent or guardian, and back out on the streets to commit more crimes.\"\nAfter an in-person community meeting with the secretary around two years ago, Phillips said \"He had the audacity to tell us, 'The data that I'm receiving doesn't support your claim of increased juvenile crime,'\" Phillips recalled. \"And our reply to that was, 'Well, obviously the numbers are going to go down because you're not allowing us to charge (them) anymore.'\"\nIn 2022, the Maryland General Assembly passed a juvenile justice reform bill stressing rehabilitation rather than punishment in addressing juvenile behavioral issues, according to its proponents. The reform took effect in 2024.\nIn August, the Cambridge Police Department presented its quarterly report, which revealed that overall crime decreased, but there were concerns regarding homicides, robberies and juvenile violence.\nHomicides, assaults, larceny and motor vehicle theft all increased from the second quarter in 2024. The homicide rate rose 200%, with two homicides that both led to arrests. One of those homicides was committed by a juvenile.\nPhillips said this level of violent crime in Cambridge is not normal.\n\"I mean, it's not normal anywhere, but I think the biggest contributing factor we had last week is the failure of our juvenile system,\" he said.\nLast school year, students in Dorchester County saw 1,682 long- and short-term suspensions with 1,232 of those suspensions related to violence, according to Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson.\nIn an attempt to curb suspensions, Dorchester County Public Schools launched a violence prevention initiative course for students, teachers, parents and staff to ensure there is community participation. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The sprinkler system activated, limiting fire damage to the room where it started.\nAccording to the Office of the Maryland State Fire Marshal, the fire originated in a rear first-floor office. The preliminary cause was deemed accidental, the result of \"an unspecified electrical event of a power surge protector.\"\nThe fire marshal estimated about $30,000 in structure and content damages. No injuries were reported.\nA total of 36 firefighters responded, with Goodwill Volunteer Fire Company the primary agency in charge. The fire was brought under control in about 30 minutes, the fire marshal said.\nThe fire alarm company contacted 911, and the school custodian also discovered the fire after the alarm activation.\nWater collected in a back hallway, one special education classroom, an office and a conference room as the sprinkler system ran for about 20 minutes, Kibler said.\nThird-party contractors were brought in to evaluate and assist. Normal operations resumed Sept. 11, after the school was closed to students and non-essential personnel Wednesday to allow cleanup and assessment. Other Queen Anne's County Public Schools were not affected.\nQACPS expressed gratitude to first responders, the Queen Anne's County Fire Marshal's Office, the Maryland State Deputy Fire Marshal, and its custodial and maintenance staff for their work in returning the building to use.\nOn its Facebook page, QACPS wrote: \"We are thankful that there were no injuries, and our fire suppression system worked appropriately.\"\nQuestions should be directed to Principal Lou Sheppard, Kibler said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat.

Woodson founded what is now the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. The following year, he began publishing what is now The Journal of African American History, a publication of history, research and book reviews.\nIn 1926, Woodson founded \"Negro History Week\" to honor the history, culture and contributions of African Americans. He chose February to coincide with the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln. In 1976, President Gerald Ford extended the observation to a month, now known as Black History Month.\nWoodson believed that history was \"made by the people, not simply or primarily by great men.\"\nLocal writer, Niambi Davis had the opportunity to contribute to the Black History display at Bethel AME. The subjects, Davis said, \"are important and more than just the usual Douglass and Tubman stories; they're the unknown local, national and international folks.\"\nThe display is open to the congregation and anyone wishing to attend services. Service begins at 11 a.m. Sunday mornings. The church is located on Washington Road in Centreville. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The location where James Taylor, a 23-year-old Black man, was lynched in 1892.That soil would find its way more than 800 miles south in a powerful message to remember a bleak chapter in history.\nThat journey was followed in the documentary film \"Get on the Bus.\"\nForty-two Kent County youths and adults made the trek, traveling to Civil Rights era landmarks in Alabama and Georgia, including the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; the King Center in Atlanta, Edmund Pettus Bridge and the National Voting Rights Museum in Selma and the Equal Justice Initiative's Community Remembrance Project in Montgomery.\nDirected by Justinian Dispenza of Andover Media, the film debuted on Valentine's Day at the Decker Theatre in Washington College with almost 200 people in attendance. it was also shown the at Ocean City Film Festival earlier this month.\nAfter its debut, the powerful emotions it invoked resulted in people interested in screening it.\nFor Dispenza, it's uplifting to see his work yielding these results.\n\"That's what we're all aiming to do as filmmakers. To make a change in people's lives. It was an incredible experience,\" he said.\nAs people left the theatre, Dispenza reflected on the process of creating \"Get on the Bus\" in slight awe.\nBecause it did not start out as being a film.\nThe idea initially came from Program Director of Minary's Dream Alliance Paul Tue III and Co-Chair of the James Taylor Justice Coalition Philip Dutton, to take a trip, educating people about the past, to the roots of the Civil Rights Movement, Alabama.\nWhat started as a field trip where Dispenza was brought on to take pictures became something else.\nDispenza, no stranger to films about social issues, was eager.\nExcept there were obstacles.\nBefore they left, he was diagnosed with Lyme's Disease. Forced to take antibiotics on the road, he was told by his doctor to avoid the sun.\n\"That's kinda tough to do, July in the Deep South,\" Dispenza said, laughing.\nIt was five days in that sweltering heat with cameras rolling 24-7, no cloud in sight.\nWhile he and Lead Editor Tanner Presswood filmed, Dispenza used long sleeves like protective gear and a floppy hat to ward off the sun.\nPerhaps if he didn't feel a strong sense of purpose, he would have thought of his discomfort more than three times in the trip. But seeing through the lens of time how racism was a way of life for many, which seemed like a different universe to him, busied him in a beneficial way.\nThey went to sites like the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, where on Sunday, September 15, 1963, at 10:22 a.m., the church became known around the world when a bomb exploded, killing four young girls attending Sunday School.\nEastern Shore girls the age of those victims read that and marveled.\n\"How can someone hate someone so much that they could hurt them and have no consideration in their heart?\" Love Jackson asked.\nAs they ascended the steps to the upper part of the church they witnessed a reenactment of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.\nOvercome by the strong feelings standing where King stood, Pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Chestertown Joel Tolbert opened up.\n\"I sit in the pulpit every Sunday. But I tried to stand in that pulpit...it's a hard space,\" he acknowledged.\nThe emotions would heighten.\nJust down the road there were statues of attack dogs, replicas of what Black people faced in 1963. There was a statue of children against the wall in a firing line and statues of enslaved people in chains, heads down in despair.\nBroadcasted at the The National Memorial for Peace and Justice were some of the reasons they were lynched, horrific in their simplicity and ignorance.\nOne was lynched for not tipping his hat to the police officer.\nAnother to yield a better return in the sharecropping business.\nThere was one, where, since a man could not be found, his 2-year-old daughter was lynched in his place.\nThe group journeyed to Selma. At the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they crossed as others did in 1965, knowing that beatings, dogs and water hoses waited for them on the other side.\nFounder of Minary's Dream Alliance, Doncella Wilson, felt that weight. Crossing the same bridge that 600 Civil Rights marchers crossed, she had to stop in the middle and reflect, before walking on., head high.\nThe camera captured the moment.\nInside the Equal Justice Initiative Museum while delivering the soil as an addition to the Legacy Museum, Dispenza broke down himself.\nHe sat on the floor and cried, having taken some ownership of the atrocities committed. But through that pain and despair, the tears and sorrow, shone hope.\n\"People were not afraid to be vulnerable,\" Dispenza said. \"It led to healing.\"\nThey were receptive to the filming process too, seeing it as a tool to do good. \"It was a tough film but a beautiful film,\" Dispenza said.\nAnd the results of the film did not leave people in despair.\nOne resident leaving Decker Theatre told him the film \"had given him a peace and hope he's never had before.\"\nThroughout the film there were positive messages to the youth. Wilson told a group of children the activists they have read about and heard were no older than they were. Tue told the youths they don't know how powerful they are.\nDispenza's film echoed with its audience as well. After the debut, it has been featured at the Bill Johnson Film Festival in Indiana.\nTue, who was with them through the entire trip, was amazed at how the footage was compiled altogether.\nHe told Dispenza, \"My God, this is going places!\"\nWith eight or nine screenings already having taken place, he was certainly not wrong.\nDispenza sees this as an urgent message to spread. \"This conversation needs to be had as school districts try to suppress Critical Race Theory,\" he said.\nIt is a topic debated among educational groups. Dispenza is more than happy to pursue these challenges and encouraged those who have great story ideas to reach out to him at Andover Media.\nFor more of his projects, visit his Imdb page at imdb.com/name/nm14340956/ as well. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Eighteen volleys of musket fire.\nThe men fought for the Union. They fought for freedom. Their freedom.\nThe 18 were Black Union soldiers who fought in the Civil War. They are buried in the cemetery behind St. Stephens AME Church in Unionville, the town named to honor their fight for freedom.\n\"Hearing the names is the best part,\" Pamela Roberts Price said. She has relatives in the graveyard.\nAround 70 people gathered at St. Stephens on a recent Sunday. There was a contingent of Union-garbed men with rifles, flags and shiny brass buckles.\nThe sounds of \"Amazing Grace\" drifted over gravestones that are worn by thousands of rainy days. A solo violin played \"Taps.\"\nSt. Stephens Pastor Eddie Scott opened the ceremony with a prayer. \"Comfort us in knowing that these soldiers that we stand on their shoulders, that we can have life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"\nHarriette Lowery has more than 10 relatives in the cemetery.\n\"I am related to one of the soldiers, definitely,\" she said. \"Benjamin Demby is my great-great-grandfather. My grandfather's mother was Agnes Demby Green. That was Benjamin's mother.\"\nLike Price, Lowery loves hearing the names.\n\"Every time I hear the names it gives me such pride,\" she said. \"Thinking about the chaos that is happening in our community or somewhere else, thinking about what they did, what they went through really touches me.\"\nShe noted that there were no promises to these soldiers.\n\"They did it hoping they would be free,\" Lowery said. \"They hoped they would get emancipation.\"\nShe noted some of the local Black soldiers traveled as far as Texas, and some of them had to walk from Texas to get home.\n\"I want the history to be told over and over again because not only do our young people, all races of young people, need to know what they went through,\" Lowery said. \"They sacrificed for us to do better. So don't give up on education and things like that. They need to know what people sacrificed.\"\nDan Cowgill of Middletown was master of ceremonies for the event. His ancestors were Quakers who donated the land for Unionville where freed slaves settled after the Civil War.\n\"We are honoring the 18 soldiers from the U.S. colored troops during the Civil War that created the town of Unionville,\" he said. \"It is amazing I still get choked up when I read these words.\"\nThe African American history within 10 miles of St. Stephens Church is remarkable. Not all of it is known or even written about. Sandy Johnson is working to change that.\n\"I am a budding historic preservationist,\" she said. \"It is good to honor those that came before us.

    "content": "Nause-Waiwash aim to preserve, uncover history of Native Americans from Dorchester County\n\n August 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 567\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Since 1989, the Nause-Waiwash Band of Indians have preserved, honored and passed down the stories of their ancestors, many of whom were Nanticoke people living along the Choptank River.Chief Donna Wolf Mother Abbott is the band's leader. The group preserves the tradition of the indigenous people who fled in the 1700s to the marshes after being converged on by foreign settlers.\nAbbott's passion for exploring the county's native history began when she enrolled in the Nause-Waiwash around 20 years ago, though she wasn't always dead set on joining.\n\"There were probably two, three, maybe four generations that were brought up believing that it was disgraceful to claim your heritage, so they didn't teach it to their children,\" Abbott said. \"And my grandmother was one of those.\"\nAbbott's cousins convinced her to enroll around 10 years before she became the band's second chief in 2014, following the death of former Chief Sewell Winterhawk Fitzhugh.\n\"They brought up a very good point, and that was, 'If you don't (join), how are we going to preserve the history?'\" Abbott recalled her cousins telling her. \"'Because it's fading, it's dying quickly. And what are you going to tell your grandchildren?'\"\nThe Nause-Waiwash is made up of around 300 descendants of not just the Nanticoke, but Choptank and Pocomoke people as well. Nause was a Nanticoke village outside of Vienna and Waiwash a Choptank village outside of Cambridge, Abbott said.\nIt's a \"matrilineal society,\" one where the women hold the power to elect a chief and make important decisions. At meetings, the nonprofit organization plans upcoming events and collaborations with other tribes in the state, along with discussing heritage and history.\nTwo churches — Hughes African Methodist Episcopal Chapel near Cambridge and Wesley Chapel south of Cambridge in Andrews — are being renovated so the Nause-Waiwash can provide services and have a resource center. The organization is hosting its 32nd annual Native American Festival on Sept. 14 in Vienna.\nSuch outreach events are meant to educate people on the history of who occupied Dorchester land, but also how Native Americans treated the land and surrounding waters.\nUNCOVERING HISTORYDespite living on the Western Shore, Erin Kennedy, a member of the Nause-Waiwash, often combs through records and land deeds in and around Taylor's Island, the community in which she grew up, hoping to piece together her mother's side of the family.\nShe took inspiration from her uncle, who created a family tree for her father's side of the family.\nOnline resources, records from the Maryland State Archives and discussions with fellow indigenous descendants on the Eastern Shore have helped Kennedy and other members of the Nause-Waiwash understand their line of ancestors.\nAbbott emphasized that she's learning every day as well. She's uncertain if permanent state recognition is in the Nause-Waiwash's future given that it's not quite as large as other tribes. However, recent recognitions such as a historical roadside marker next to the Choptank River have raised the prominence of the dedicated nonprofit's work.\nNearly 10 years in, Abbott is developing a love and commitment to the work of the Nause-Waiwash.\n\"I have this passion for it, which I never really knew I had until I became involved,\" Abbott said. \"And I do know that a lot of our history is gone. I want to read all these books and see if I can't find some new information out that I don't know. So I'm reading books that I'd never thought I'd ever read before.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Rabbi Hyman delivers multicultural understanding\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: News \n \n 705\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Easton has been and is blessed with an extraordinarily number of exceptionally talented individuals engaged in a wide range of community service endeavors.One of them is Rabbi Peter Hyman DD (Doctor of Divinity) who is retiring in October after serving 18 years as the first full-time rabbi at Easton's Temple B'nai Israel.\nRabbi Hyman has a long history in walking his talk on promoting greater understanding of and respect for individuals with different religious beliefs and different faith journeys.\nThere is no more enduring symbol of Rabbi Hyman's commitment to respect for other religious beliefs than a Persian rug he bought in Israel 40 years ago. It is now on display in his office. That rug includes 99 names of God in Arabic. Rabbi Hyman views it as a metaphorical bridge connecting people of different faiths.\nHe once asked the leaders of a mosque if they could help him translate some of the Arabic words on his rug. They did so, amazed that such an inclusive rug was owned and displayed by a rabbi.\nFor Rabbi Hyman, it was simply his belief that \"building relationships not only creates friendships, but they also cement ties.\"\nA partial list of his local efforts to improve the quality of life in our community and beyond, includes serving as a member, program vice president and president of the Talbot Association of Clergy and Laity. He received an Award of Appreciation for Outstanding and Inspiring Interfaith Work in Talbot County for a Temple B'nai Israel February Lecture Series: \"Introduction to Islam.\"\nHe was a recipient of the NAACP Dorothy Webb Black Community Service Legacy Award and a recipient of a Governor William Donald Schaefer Helping People Award. He was a member of The Frederick Douglass Celebration Committee and delivered the sermon at the Community Interfaith Worship Celebration, which was a part of the \"Douglass Returns\" statue dedication.\nAn author and teacher, he served as a presenter and instructor at Chesapeake College's Institute for Adult Learning and collaborated with Bishop Joel Marcus Johnson to launch a \"Downtown Lunch and Learn\" program. He was elected to the board of directors at the YMCA of the Chesapeake and appointed chair of the board at the Easton YMCA.\nSupport for Scouting has been a huge part of Rabbi Hyman's life since he earned his Eagle Scout award, as did his two sons. That is an achievement that has been earned by only 6% of all Scouts since 1912.\nHe has served as a scoutmaster and a chaplain at Scout World Jamborees in Thailand, England, Sweden and Japan and a National Jamboree in the United States. He was the first national chair for the Messengers of Peace Program, BSA, after having served as a national chair of the Jewish Committee on Scouting and as national Jewish chaplain — Boy Scouts of America. He was the keynote speaker at a national annual meeting of the BSA \"Duty to God Breakfast\" in Washington, D.C.\nHe is a recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award for distinguished service to youth awarded by the National Council of Boy Scouts of America. He is also a recipient of the Bronze Wolf Award, which is the Scouts' highest honor. It is presented by the World Scout Committee to recognize the service, commitment and contributions of volunteers to the Scout movement. Not surprisingly Hyman received the award for his interfaith activities and his lifelong commitment to \"building bridges between people and nations.\"\nRabbi Hyman represented the BSA in Saudi Arabia at Saudi Nation Day when they received an award for the work of the BSA with the Messengers of Peace Program. This program promotes service projects through social media in effort to achieve world peace.\nHyman recalls that trip as the most amazing experience of his life because he was welcome in a Muslim country.\nWhile the news of Rabbi Hyman's impending retirement is bittersweet, there is some good news.\nHe is not planning to leave the Eastern Shore.\nWhether he stays here for the short term or long term, one thing is certain. He has made countless selfless contributions to help make Easton, Talbot County, and our world a better place.\nEach one of them has earned Rabbi Hyman a well-deserved thank you and Godspeed.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant based in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Frederick Douglass Day continues to share abolitionist's legacy\n\n October 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Wendy Weitzel wweitzel@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 577\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The first time Harriette Lowery heard that Frederick Douglass had grown up in Talbot County was when she moved back to Easton with her husband in the early 2000s.Lowery was surprised to hear of Douglass' local origins. She had grown up in Talbot County, but she had never known it was the famed abolitionist's birthplace.\n\"The historical society had put a notice in the paper asking for people to respond to a question — 'Is anybody interested in honoring Frederick Douglass in some way since he's our native son.' And I read that and thought, 'I knew a lot about Frederick Douglass, but I did not know he was from Talbot County,'\" she said Saturday, surveying the crowd outside the Talbot County Free Library that had assembled for the annual Frederick Douglass Day celebration.\n\"... I was a little embarrassed by that but more interested in doing something because of that,\" Lowery said.\nLowery and her late husband became founding members of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society, the group that spearheaded the process of having a statue of Douglass erected on the Talbot County Court House lawn. The statue was unveiled to a crowd of thousands in June, 2011, after years of sometimes tense back-and-forth between the honor society, members of the community and local governments.\nFrederick Douglass Day evolved from that unveiling ceremony in an effort to continue the honor society's mission of educating the community about Douglass.\n\"Since 2011, the Frederick Douglass Honor Society decided that it wanted to continue efforts to continue the legacy of Frederick Douglass,\" said Walter Black, another founding member of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society. \"So the main thing that we concentrated on is the Frederick Douglass Day.\"\nOn Saturday, Frederick Douglass Day filled downtown Easton with a parade, a ceremony, a lecture, a children's village and a city block filled with vendors, nonprofits and live entertainment.\n\"The event gets bigger and better every year,\" said Debbi Dodson, the Frederick Douglass Day event coordinator. \"More people get involved and more people attend, so that is a sign that people appreciate it and really support it.\"\nThe keynote speaker for this year's event, Keidrick Roy, said that although this was his first time visiting Talbot County, he has been working with the Frederick Douglass Honor Society for several years.\nKeidrick Roy, a fellow at Harvard University, signed copies of his new book, \"American Dark Age: Racial Feudalism and the Rise of Black Liberalism,\" at the event. Roy said Douglass is heavily featured in the work.\n\"I've always wanted to be in the place where Frederick Douglass walked and talked and had many of his formative experiences, so it's very special for me to be here to do this,\" he said. \"I loved the celebration this morning, seeing so many people from different parts of the city, different parts of the town come out and honor Douglass in a variety of ways.\"\nIn holding the event every year, Lowery said the honor society hopes to ensure that all members of the community are aware of Douglass's ties to Talbot County and of how the principles of equality and freedom that Douglass espoused are still relevant today.\n\"What we wanted was for everybody to look at Douglass as an American hero and not an African American hero,\" Lowery said.\nOn Saturday, Lowery remarked that Talbot County had made progress toward that goal since 2011.\n\"We're always growing and getting better, or we should be anyway,\" she said. \"Every year, I know that there's progress.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
