All of our neighboring county fair facilities are all owned by county governments. So we have a lot of things to worry about. We have to worry about facility maintenance, repairs, operations.\"\nAs co-chair of Ag Center's fair committee, Clougherty says that the fair has maintained that unique distinction.\n\"We know who we are,\" she said. \"We're a small, old-time, family-fun outing.\"\nWhile the center is hosting its 41st county fair this week, it serves the community year-round, not just during fair weekend. It hosts events such as weddings, birthday parties, meetings and workshops.\nWith no full-time paid staff members, the Ag Center relies on volunteers through community organizations. It makes for a truly unique and personable experience during any event, Clougherty said.\n\"It's a labor of love and service,\" she said.\nNEW PARTNERSHIPSClougherty says the Ag Center is always open to new relationships throughout the county. For instance, the Rotary Club of Easton recently held its first event at the center to initiate new officers.\nAnother new partnership is coming this fall, as four soccer fields at the property will house Chapel District Sports' first year of soccer practices and games while Chapel District Elementary School is under construction.\n\"I just think it's a really good way to expose people to what we do here and build that community connectedness,\" Clougherty said.\nShe believes that partnership and similar ones will allow \"kids and families to come together.\" She also mentioned an \"ag-accurate book trail\" will be on the grounds of the center by this fall, which will feature readings and activities at multiple stations.\nIMPROVEMENTSAs the Ag Center grows in its community reach, so has the need for facility improvements. Clougherty pinpointed recent upgrades, including up-to-date electric and a new sound system.\nFacility improvements would be completely different without assistance from Maryland 4-H youth, Clougherty said. Through Maryland 4-H's Diamond Clover Award Program, which requires service hours, local youth have transformed the Ag Center.\nShe said 4-H members have been responsible for rebuilding the outdoor stage, barns, installing fans in the buildings and making benches and the sidewalk accessible.\n\"We wouldn't be as far as we are today if it hadn't been for several outstanding youth throughout the years,\" Clougherty said.\nIt's just one example of how the community gives back to the Ag Center that has long served county residents, particularly youth.\n\"It's a special gold star for the kids who see the need and work hard to contribute,\" Clougherty said. \"Because they know they've benefitted from being out here.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Best in show: 4-H kids work hard to raise, ready animals for fair\n\n July 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lilly Howard Special to the Whig | Section: News \n \n 747\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FAIR HILL \u2014 In the months leading up to the Cecil County Fair, 4-H members can be found working hard, raising and training their animals to get them ready for the fair.At the fair, the animals are one of the main attractions, housed in the fairgrounds' barns in between the various competitions and showings that take place throughout fair week.\nTails and Trails 4-H club worked together this year to try something new: raising and showing 100 meat chickens.\n\"They eat and drink a whole lot more than you would ever imagine at this point. We bought a bag of feed yesterday and we are almost out of it,\" 4-H member Katilyn Carter said.\nCarter, 16, is showing meat goats, meat chickens, and doing herdsmen with her pony. Herdsmen entails keeping your animal at the fair all week, ensuring they are fed, watered, healthy and clean, with a corresponding informational board to educate the public and judges about your animal.\nTo prepare her meat chickens, Carter washes them two to three days before the show to ensure they have a natural oily shine. This paid off, as her chickens won first and second place ribbons at the fair over the weekend.\n\"It's going to sound really funny, but you actually blow dry them. You want them to be really fluffy\u2026You just want them to look like little chunk balls of fluff and meat,\" said Carter about preparing her chickens for show day.\nIn showmanship competitions, you must be very knowledgeable about your animal in order to show the judges that you put in the work to be successful, according to Carter. The 4-H member must present their animal to the best of their ability, demonstrating cleanliness and knowledge on what they eat, their parts, their breed and more, said former 4-H member and long-time judge Carolyn Lawrence.\nFor meat goats, who are bred and raised to become a meal on someone's plate, the 4-H members start working with them once they are born in January or March. A few weeks later, once they're weaned from their mothers they start training them to walk with a halter and lead line, taking them on mile long walks several times a week, according to Libby Kondracki, Tails and Trails leader.\nWhen it comes to show day at the fair, Carter washes her goat in the morning and covers him to ensure he stays clean white. Since they're raised for meat, she then blow dries the animals to get them looking as fluffy as possible. According to county fair regulations, no baby powder, artificial coloring, or adhesives like hairspray can be used on the animals.\n\"The power in fitting your animal, and knowing how to fit your animal and showing your animal to make it to where you know you're showing this animal the best you can to its fullest potential. You really have to work with your goat,\" Carter said.\nBefore the fair, members get together at least twice a week and meet up as a show team and prepare together. Many of the 4-H parent leaders were 4-H members themselves when they were growing up. And many current members plan to stay involved after they age out at 18 years old to continue to give back to the community that helped shape them.\n\"I really love teaching them,\" said Carter about helping teach younger 4-H'ers. \"Because they're going to be, you know, when I'm done in two more years, they're going to be the ones that are taking over. So you really want them to be the mentor you kids that you were to them.\"\nAlthough many 4-H members compete against each other at the Cecil County Fair, they are all a team at the end of the day.\n\"When one wins, we all win,\" said Carter.\nIn addition to the camaraderie 4-H supplies, it also helps educate the public about the livestock they often consume.\nThanks to being involved in the Rising Sun 4-H Club for the past four years, Mason Gentry enjoys educating the public about his animals and their purposes. For example, he explained the importance of knowing that a Heifer is a female cow who has not been bred yet, a cow is a female cow who has been bred and had a calf, and a Steer is a male cow that's been castrated and is meant for beef.\n\"The goal of the fair is to educate the public about agriculture, give them an opportunity to see where the food comes from,\" said Mark Barczewki, 4-H Barn Stompers club leader. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Both of their families arrived in the United States in the 1700's. Eventually, the Covingtons' settled in Queen Anne's County. Beth's ancestors landed on the Eastern Shore of Virginia and migrated to Mississippi.Henry's great-grandfather, also called Henry, was a Methodist minister at three local churches, Burrisville, Starr, and Salem near Church Hill. His son (Henry's grandfather), Edward, was a preacher and tenant farmer. Henry's dad, Henry Sr., preached for a while, but then began a career with New York Life Insurance.\nIn 1979, Henry Sr. and his wife Kathryn, bought the Peace and Plenty Farm from the Wright family and started farming. Henry Sr. always said there were two things his father approved of during the year other than work and going to church; attending the 4-H fair and riding to Rehoboth Beach for the day! To get there, all nine kids piled in the back of a 6-wheel truck filled with straw! Henry's mother, Kathryn, was raised on the Richard family farm near Templeville, along with her 12 siblings.\nBeth was born in Mississippi where her maternal grandparents, the Dilworths, farmed. She moved to Kent Island at the age of 4, when her dad began working for Maryland DNR. Beth's family also had their faith, it was a big part of growing up and they attended church regularly. After graduating from Chesapeake College, Beth attended the University of Maryland Dental School, earning her degree in dental hygiene.\nHenry graduated from the University of Delaware with a degree in Plant Science. Spring of his junior year, he attended a semester at Chesapeake College and met Beth. Henry was recruited by some high school friends at Chesapeake to play baseball. At one baseball practice, Henry noticed one of the softball players. She was wearing red shorts and Henry asked one of his teammates \"who is that girl in the red shorts?\". Henry was told it was Beth, his friend Earl's little sister. Beth mentioned \"since she was a couple years younger than her brother, no one noticed her until college!\". After the chance meeting at baseball and softball practice, they dated and were married in 1982.\nIn 1980, Henry started working at Agrico and Crop Production Services, selling fertilizer and Pioneer seed. Henry had his first opportunity to rent a farm on his own from Gladys Cahall. His grandmother was Cahall's Sunday school teacher so she knew Henry's family very well.\nHenry enjoyed farming with his dad for many years. After 10 years, Henry became a full time Pioneer sales rep while also farming over 1300 acres. Henry and Beth dreamed of owning their own farm, and in 2001 that dream came true. They bought a farm near Centreville, and named it Broadland. After 30 years, Henry retired from the seed business in 2021. A good friend, Anton Roe now continues the business as a local Pioneer sales rep. Henry and Beth continue to farm.\nHenry and Beth have three children; Will, Ben, and Sarah. Will graduated from Washington and Lee University and is now working as a systems engineer for Communications Electronics Systems Integrated. Ben graduated from Iowa State University. He works for the University and John Deere as an agricultural and biosystems engineer. Sarah graduated from the University of Richmond with a degree in Biology. Sarah teaches biology at Queen Anne's County High School.\nBeth had worked off the farm as a part-time dental hygienist for 38 years. This allowed her to take care of the kids and help on the farm. Their three kids were actively involved in 4-H, showing pigs, steers, and rabbits, and entering indoor exhibits. Henry was recruited by Paul Gunther to help with the open farm crops at the fair and to assist the Godfreys with open vegetables. Henry and Beth gladly did this for over 30 years.\nAfter the kids had all left home and Beth retired as a dental hygienist, she had time to work on one of her hobbies, quilting. She said, \"My grandmother sewed and taught me to sew. I started out making doll clothes and then made clothes for myself, and later, my kids. After the kids left home, I started to quilt\". Beth has been generous in her quilting talents, giving quilts as gifts and donating them to people in need.\nAbout the same time Henry started collecting old tractors. His first was a 1958 John Deere 730. The 730 was one of his favorite childhood toys and 1958 was the year in which he was born. At some point Beth mentioned she would like to have a Farmall cub, like the one she remembered Mr. Ernest Porter owning. Henry found a 1960 cub right away (the same year she was born!) Mr. Ernest Porter was a wonderful Christian man who was very dear to both Henry and Beth. Mr. Ernest Porter was a big influence in Henry's life. \"He never seemed to get upset\" Henry said. He was also a faithful member of Beth's church on Kent Island.\nHenry and Beth consider themselves so very blessed to have had all the experiences that come with living in our farming community. They have thoroughly enjoyed supporting and serving others through their church, 4-H, and school activities. Henry said with a smile \"people are generally good and giving back to your community keeps our community close\". He said \"my father never missed a 4-H Fair up until his passing and I feel the same way. The fair is a good way to stay involved and see people\u2026Everyone should give some of their time to their community. That's how we teach the next generation.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

For older kids, there was a mechanical bull.\nThe Reger Pavilion had live music. Everything from the old-timey country sound of the Jone's Brothers to the foot stomping Amish Outlaws and '80s-inflected The Reagan Years.\nThere were lots of competitions to show younger community members' efforts to raise dairy cows, goats, swines, horses, rabbits and beef.\nJody Neal, Caroline County FFA Advisor and ag teacher at Caroline Career and Technology Center had lots of students participating in fair contests.\n\"I have nine kids showing animals today. I have kids showing sheep, swine, market goats and breed goats,\" Neal said.\nThe students raise their animals for a year leading up to the fair. After all that effort, the animals ended up at the livestock auction on Saturday night. This sale funds the students' project for next year. The pork can go back into the school system and is served in the lunch line.\nSkyler Blunt, a participant in the swine competition, said it was rewarding to show a year's worth of work.\n\"I have two Hereford barrows and one Yorkshire gilt,\" Blunt said. \"The best part is the accomplishment that the fair brings you and getting to show people your project for the year.\"\nEmma Boyle, 18, who had just graduated from high school, said, \"I am showing two crossbred pigs. I have been doing this since I was five. I love it. This is my last year. My pigs are named Buzz and Woody.\"\nBarbara Carrow, who was announcing the swine show, is co-leader of Pure Country 4-H Club. She has 62 kids in her Caroline County chapter. They showed at least 50 swine at the contest.\n\"I love working with young people, and I love animals. It teaches them responsibility and how to interact with adults other people. It gives them confidence,\" Carrow said.\nWandering in the crowd was a princess \u2014 the Dairy Princess.\nCaroline Kimball of Queen Anne's County High School wears a sash and a tiara.\n\"I am the Eastern Shore Dairy Princess because I represent the dairy industry. I like educating people about the dairy industry. You can add a dairy product to all three meals of the day. I like chocolate milk after practice. I want to major in animal science,\" Kimball said.\nThe judge, Gabe Zepp of Carroll County, picked first, second and third place winners. With every participant, win or lose, he offered instruction on how to improve.\n\"I want to see these hogs with their heads up at all times. Head placement. I want to see that they are comfortable with a whip. Nice and in control of the hog,\" Zepp said.\nNavonne Owen, 4-H Educator for Caroline County, said, \"They have all worked so hard on their projects and this is the time to shine. They are all doing an excellent job. They are resilient and flexible and they are learning so many life skills from the project. It will help them in the future.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

As owner of Green's Septic, he and his employee of six years Pete Padley enjoy educating kids on the vehicles each year.\nOther than the big trucks, local and state emergency personnel were on site giving demonstrations.\nChief Logan Quinn from the Kent County Office of Emergency Services had lifesaving items on display: cardiac heart equipment, CPR devices and a pediatric response bag.\nChestertown Police Chief Ron Dixon presented some everyday tools they use to assist the public: bolt cutters, pry bars and jumper cables.\n\"When people see these items, we hope they see we're there for the community,\" Dixon said.\nWith a generous crowd scattered throughout the large grounds, it was calm, a good environment to learn, talking to equipment operators.\nThat calm was momentarily shattered at around 11:30 a.m. when a helicopter from the Maryland State Police was spotted hovering over the grounds. As soon as the chopper touched grass, kids and adults made a beeline to it, excited to get a tour.\n\"It's an impressive bird,\" said airline pilot of 25 years John Strigle. As a civilian volunteer he had a wealth of knowledge he shared along with the state police operators.\nThey answered questions, letting kids sit in the Agusta Westland AW139, creating lots of memories and providing parents with photo opportunities.\nOther than vehicles, the various Kent County 4-H clubs manned stations running activities for the public to enjoy. The Kent Fuzzy Tails & Shiny Scales group allowed a chance to pet the rabbits, talk to their owners and participate in a prize-winning activity.\nPrincipal Agent Associate, 4-H Youth Development Kent County, Beth Hill, behind an inventive bike/blender making pumpkin smoothies, said these kinds of events help generate new members.\nIn addition kids participated in a hay bale toss and Tic Tac Toe with pumpkins, while Matt Jones gave hayrides and various organizations like Rock Hall Dental fielded questions at tables.\nCo-organizer Cindy Moore said Touch-a-truck came about to show appreciation to the 4-H clubs who maintained the place year-round.\nShe thanked everyone for showing up that day.\n\"We all work together on this,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Following the land sale from the church, the garden had to look for a new home and McKnight reached out to the County Commissioners over the summer for assistance.\nFormed in 2015 as the Galilee Community Garden, the Kent Island Community Garden serves the need for a community garden in the Harbor View area of Chester and has since blossomed to include church volunteers, local Master Gardeners, Boy Scout Troop 495 and neighbors of all sorts ready to get their thumbs green.\nThe community garden also partners with the University of Maryland Extension Master Gardeners Program for educational opportunities.\nThe garden offers many beds of vegetables, flowers, and a separate herb garden with an irrigation system and compost area.\nThe Maryland Food Bank cites that one in three Marylanders face hunger. \"With several of our gardeners in independent living facilities and one handicapped gardener, we realize how critical it is to establish a new space for our community garden,\" McKnight said.\nVoicing their appreciation for the garden, the county Commissioners approved a $1,500 grant to help the garden blossom at its new location.\nThe new location's property next to the offices of the Fire Marshal is an ideal location to offer sufficient land for growth along with the necessary utilities as well as close proximity to the Cross-Island Trail, local schools, and the public library.\n\"It's going to be a great resource for the county,\" McKnight said.\nThe Kent Island Community Garden is always looking for new gardeners and civic minded groups to help build garden beds, according to McKnight.\nThe all inclusive garden stakes claim in having the only handicapped-accessible garden beds in the county, he said.\n\"We are a diverse and unique group of twenty gardeners and are the only community garden in Queen Anne's County that is open to all, \" McKnight said.\nLooking ahead, the garden hopes to build a few garden beds before winter sets in and In the spring seeks funds to install a deer fence around the perimeter, he said.\nMore information about Kent Island Community Garden can be found by contacting McKnight at McKnightJohn143@gmail.com or 202-257-3754. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Farming, new administration main topics of Eastern Shore Delegation meeting\n\n January 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 671\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 On Friday morning, the Eastern Shore Delegation met over Zoom to discuss budgets, the new presidential administration and agriculture on the Eastern Shore.U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) spoke to the state legislators on his excitement for the Trump administration that was sworn in on Monday and the changes that will be made to government spending now that Tesla CEO Elon Musk will co-lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.\n\"I do believe that we have to operate more, and the federal government has to operate more like the private sector does,\" Harris said. \"...Elon Musk is going to do in terms of promoting government efficiency because in the end we cannot continue trillion dollar deficits into the future. We have to control federal spending. We are cursed with without a balanced budget amendment.\"\nSeveral Republican delegation members at the meeting echoed these sentiments.\nMany spoke on the state of Maryland and the amount of federal employees it has, some saying the state is too heavily dependent on federal employment.\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said recent actions of some state officials in response to actions taken by the Trump administration do not align with Maryland's needs. He said the state is \"trying to find $3 billion\" and yet is involved in lawsuits against the federal government.\n\"The (Maryland) attorney general seems to have plenty of money to want to sue the federal government,\" Hutchinson said. \"Well, at the same time, the state has their hand out to the federal government saying, 'I need money for the Key Bridge. I need more Medicaid money.'\"\nPRIORITIES FOR FARMERSThroughout the meeting, several representatives and supporters of farmers and agriculture policy spoke, including Tyler Hough, director of government relations for the Maryland Farm Bureau, who shared priorities for the organization for the next fiscal year.\nHough said the bureau has three policy priorities, including private property rights and eminent domain, solar energy, and agriculture education. In his presentation, he focused on the importance of education for the state.\n\"The opportunity to educate the youth, even get into the middle school areas, the opportunity to have education in the high schools and the FFA (agriculture education) programs and the value that FFA brings along with the 4-H programs that already exist, is just fantastic for these students,\" Hough said.\nLater on the agenda, a presentation was made by members of the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology, an organization centering scientific research, policy analysis and outreach and education efforts.\nKate Everts, executive director of the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology, led the in-depth presentation, in which she highlighted the Maryland Climate-Smart Agriculture Project and the extensive outreach to Eastern Shore farmers that the center has done.\nEverts said the farm-centered project seeks to find what agriculture needs to be adaptable and profitable for a future dictated by climate change.\n\"We're seeing changes in weather across the country, but here in Maryland,\" Everts said, \"how is it impacting our farms and our forests? And again, we want to make sure that they are in a good position to stay economically viable going forward. So we're all about making sure their businesses are successful.\"\nEverts said the research team evaluated potential impacts on local agriculture and conducted outreach with farmers and service providers.\nToward the end of the presentation, Harris shared his appreciation for the work that the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology does for farmers and the importance of keeping them in the forefront of policy and work done for the state.\n\"It's very good to hear this presentation today because so often what happens in Annapolis is we go up with a lot of emotion, a lot of heart to represent and protect the interests of Agriculture, and what you're talking about, along with other institutions, is bringing science to bear with the lens of the Eastern Shore and certainly throughout the state. The point is through the lens of agriculture, which is so important,\" Harris said.\nThe next meeting of the Eastern Shore Delegation will be held on Jan. 31 via Zoom. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Last year, Stacey Hann-Ruff, the director of arts center, announced during a presentation to the Calvert County commissioners that Annmarie Garden officials plan to expand the existing sculpture garden to include the 20-acres.\nIn 1991, Francis and Ann Marie Koenig donated the land where the facility is located. The expansion plans include a 15,000-square foot welcome center.\nThe Calvert County Master Gardeners program trains volunteer horticulture educators to support the University of Maryland Extension's initiative to educate locals about best horticulture practices.\nNoting that the greenhouse project is being supported by state grant money from the Maryland General Assembly, the Rural Maryland Council and the Cove Point Natural Heritage Trust, Edward Goodman, the local master gardener specialist, called the effort \"an amazing collaboration.\"\nGoodman told Southern Maryland News there are about 50 active master gardeners. The training course takes about three to four months to complete and is culminated by a final exam. Then, the master gardener candidate must complete 40 hours of community service.\n\"There are lots of opportunities,\" Goodman said.\nThe fledgling master gardeners share their knowledge at such venues as the North Beach Nature Center, Calvert Marine Museum and numerous other locations.\n\"The biggest thing of the mater gardener program is to educate others on sustainable horticulture practices,\" Goodman said.\nWhile he couldn't provide a timeline for when the greenhouse would be completed, Goodman said \"the project has crossed the hurdle of permitting and processing.\"\n\"This is the first step in the [expansion] plan,\" Cari DeSantis of Ann's Circle, the nonprofit organization that supports many programs and activities at Annmarie Garden.\nIn briefly addressing the gathering, Bruce Fall of the Cove Point Natural Heritage Trust commended the garden's staff and volunteers \"for bringing people in to our area with events.\"\nFall said the visitors, who come to the garden for such traffic-jamming events as Artsfest and Halloween in the Garden, spend their cash at local restaurants and other businesses, which bolsters the area's economy.\nBefore grabbing shovels for some fun in the patch of dirt where the new greenhouse will stand, plastic glasses of champagne and cider were distributed to attendees. Everyone drank a toast.\nDeSantis said the toast was \"to celebrate the public-private partnerships that make Calvert County such a beautiful place.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

At each station, volunteers talked to students about various aspects of the agricultural field, from animal sciences to land and water safety to farm drones. Organizers said that approximately 80 professionals volunteered their services during the event.\n\"It's giving these seventh graders insight to all the careers available in agriculture, not just working in a field,\" Atticks said.\nBased on feedback after last year's Ag Education Day, organizers set out to make this year's event even better. Mel Bacon, Cecil County Farm Museum's executive director and an Ag Education Day board member, said that surveys and an essay contest given to students who attended the event last year helped them hone in on what made the event shine.\nHe also noted that CCPS has been a huge help in pulling the event off and raising funds\n\"CCPS has been very supportive,\" Bacon said.\nAccording to CCPS Instructional Coordinator Day Mashongamhende, CCPS incorporated Ag Education Day as part of its curriculum for the 1,042 middle schoolers in the county this year, which allowed them to embed the event in the schedule and organize lessons around it.\n\"We teach kids fundamentals,\" Mashongamhende said. \"We see how everything connects.\"\nMashongamhende also noted that CCPS officials took a trip to the Ag Education Day held in Queen Anne's County earlier this year to incorporate ideas from that event into Cecil's own.\nOne of the major goals of the event, organizers stressed, is to interest students in the ag industry and show them that there are a wide range of career options available within ag.\nFollowing the event, there are options for students whose interest has been piqued.\n\"Search out a local 4-H club,\" recommended Paul Rickert with University of Maryland Extension, one of the event's organizers.\nAnother option is to enroll in the Ag Sciences programs that the Cecil County School of Technology offers once the students reach high school.\nAlongside the adult volunteers staffing the event, a number of CCST Ag Sciences students manned stations and worked with the students at Ag Education Day. The CCST students spoke to kids about the programs they are a part of, giving them a preview into things they could be studying in a few short years.\nStudents from non-ag programs at CCST also came at lunchtime to speak with students about their own programs, according to Rachel Coffey, an Agricultural Sciences teacher at CCST.\nCCST juniors Kaitlynne Harrigan and DeAnna Parker were part of the staff at the beekeeping station on Wednesday. The pair plan to do their capstone project on beekeeping together.\nThey enjoyed sharing their knowledge with the younger students and watching them get engaged with the subject.\n\"They're learning a bit of everything,\" said Harrigan. \"It's amazing and I get really happy when the kids ask a question.\"\nHarrigan noted that she didn't know much about ag before beginning at CCST, but finds the field fascinating.\n\"If I could recommend it to others, I would,\" Harrigan said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The site is fully built and ready for the growing season.\nThe garden features 18 raised beds for community use, one charity bed for food bank donations, and three specialty education beds planted with native pollinators, flowers, and herbs.\nIn addition to offering residents a place to grow their own food and contribute fresh produce to local food banks, the garden serves as a hands-on learning space. Through partnerships with the Maryland Department of Agriculture and the University of Maryland Master Gardener Extension Program, it supports educational programs on native plants, beneficial insects, and land management practices that protect the Chesapeake Bay.\n\"There are life science hands-on opportunities available locally,\" said organizer John McKnight.\nCounty officials, residents, and Bill Tharpe from the Maryland Department of Agriculture joined the open house to show their support for the project.\nMore information about the Kent Island Community Garden is available at kicg.online. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Her swine Novalee was awarded grand champion among market hogs.Novalee started out winning first among heavyweights. Then Randy, Troyer's other hog, was awarded first among middleweights. At the final showdown, it was between Novalee, Randy, and Laurel Clarke's lightweight champion hog, Diva.\nJudge Kelsey Zepp's decision was Novalee, exclaiming one hog stood out among the others throughout the competition.\nTroyer's mother, Stacie was among her daughter's cheering campaign and beamed, \"Proud momma here! She has worked so hard.\"\nTroyer exclaimed she always did well in past competitions but was shocked that both Randy and Novalee went home winners.\nThe mixed breed hogs can hold their snouts up high as the best there is in 2025.\nTroyer pointed out the judge looks for a specific musculature among heavy weights and for middle weight Randy, the same kind of structure just slightly leaner. Zepp also looks for how clean they are and basically the potential of a quality market pig.\nHaving prize-winning hogs requires dedication. For Novalee and Randy, training started around January. Troyer walked them every day to build stamina, washed their coats making sure there were no yellow circles and ensured they had clean water.\nRecently they have found a quality feed that works for them too \u2014 Sunglow \u2014 which provides a balance of carbohydrates, amino acids, innovative ingredients, active nutrient supply, and show micronutrients.\nAll this prepared before under the bright lights of the fair, the swine were led by their handlers around the ring with pig sticks to encourage their utmost cooperation.\nThe prize was taken back home to Harmony Acres in Kennedyville, where Novalee and Randy and the Troyer family could get a little rest.\nTroyer, a graduate of Queen Anne's County High School, enjoys learning, competing and making friends in 4-H. She has one more year at the fair and will be attending Chesapeake College in the fall pursuing an early childhood teaching degree.\n\"This was a very cool experience,\" she remarked.\nSo what rewards do the grand champion hogs get?\n\"Just some street-cred around here,\" Stacie joked. \"No...correction on that...some fair-cred.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Seaweed boom? - The global market for seaweed could see significant growth; can the U.S. get in on the aquaculture and ecological wave?\n\n September 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; APG National Enterprise Editor | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 1208\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Is there a future for seaweed farming in the U.S.?Could seaweed farming see a big global aquaculture boom - along with helping clean up ocean waters challenged by climate change and environmental degradations via natural filtering systems?Rafael Cuevas Uribe and Rick Zechman want to find out - and see potential on both fronts.Zechman is associate dean of marine operations and Cuevas Uribe is a fisheries biology professor at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (Cal Poly Humboldt).They are leading a new university effort to farm seaweed (bull kelp) off the far northern coast of California.They want to see if the U.S. can boost its overall production of seaweed - which serves as a natural cleaning filter for bodies of saltwater confronted by climate change and in need of environmental remediation.Right now, the U.S. seaweed farming is concentrated in Maine, Hawaii and Alaska, according to the Cal Poly researchers.U.S. kelp and seaweed production is barely a blip in a marketplace dominated by China, Indonesia and other Asian markets in a sector that is projected to grow to $14.3 billion by 2028, according to research firm IMARC Group.The Cal Poly school created a seaweed farm in 2019 leasing space in Humboldt Bay from the local harbor district. It recently harvested a small crop of kelp from that farm.Cuevas Uribe said the school's operation is for research purposes.\"Our system is purely experimental. A commercial operation would be much larger,\" he said.Graduate students help work the farm and with research into its production and viability. Its most recent harvest entailed analyzing kelp planted onto various types of ropes \"to test growth rates and viability\" with the aim of helping \"future aquaculture entrepreneurs,\" according to the school.\u00b7 MARKETPLACE AND GROWTH POTENTIALSeaweed (or kelp) can be farmed for food and dietary uses - including sushi nori as well as for uses in soups, salads and snacks. It is an especially popular food in Asia, but could see growth as global diets look for alternatives to traditional proteins and face food insecurity challenges spurred by climate change and geopolitical conflicts.Zechman said certain types of seaweed can be used in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals as part of compounds and ingredients. Seaweed has long had herbal and homeopathic uses.Brooklyn-based business research firm IMARC pegs the worldwide commercial seaweed market at $7.5 billion in 2022, according to a new analysis released late last month. The group sees the industry growing to $14.3 billion by 2028 with an 11.64% annual growth rate between 2023 and 2028.\"The rising demand for seaweed in dietary supplements, owing to its nutritive content, flavor-enhancing, and weight loss properties, is primarily catalyzing the global seaweed market,\" IMARC writes in its August analysis.That bullish outlook has plenty of company.An Aug. 30 market analysis by Redding, California-based Meticulous Market Research Pvt. Ltd., sees significant growth potential with seaweed-based fertilizers.\"Recently, there has been a growing interest in seaweed fertilizers for higher crop production and soil quality improvement. Seaweed nutrients boost plant growth, enhance soil fertility, improve crop yield, and boost plant resistance to diseases and pests. This can reduce the need for inorganic fertilizers and pesticides, leading to safer food production,\" the group writes in its research report.Fertilizer supply chains have also been recently challenged by U.S. and European sanctions against Russia and Belarus - two of the leading fertilizer producers - over the Ukraine war.Another August report by the World Bank sees substantial growth in the seaweed aquaculture space.The international financial institution sees the potential for a $11.8 billion boom in growth in seaweed farming by 2031 with potential gains in using seaweeds/kelps in pet food, animal feed, nutritional supplements, protein alternatives and methane reducing additives.\"Seaweed farming demonstrates how development, climate and nature work together to generate value and uplift communities. Seaweed farming will be a source of nutrition security as well as an alternative to synthetic fertilizer,\" said Martien van Nieuwkoop, World Bank's global director for agriculture and food in a statement last month on the growth potentials.\u00b7 HELPING THE OCEANS, ECOSYSTEMS AND THE PLANETFor Zechman, it's not just about monetary gains and an industry boom. He sees more seaweed cultivation as a way to help clean up ocean waters.He said seaweed in animal feed could reduce methane emissions from cows.The world's 1 billion cows produce an estimated 40% of global methane emissions through manure and 'burping' - a contributor to climate change, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.Seaweed-based animal feed could help reduce cow burps and flatulence.Zechman said kelp beds off the California coast have been decreasing significantly because of a decline in sea stars. The sea stars feed on sea urchins, which feed on kelp and seaweed. More sea urchins mean less seaweed which helps keep ocean waters clean via their natural filtering.\"The technology that's involved in starting a farm for seaweed can also be used for conservation,\" he said.\u00b7 U.S. growth and market potentialSo, what about the U.S. getting in on a potential seaweed boom?Global seaweed aquaculture production has grown to 35 million tons annually.Data from FAO in 2019 showed North American seaweed production at 23,000 tons.Ninety-eight percent of the seaweed harvested globally over the past two decades has occurred in Asia with China (57%) and Indonesia (29%) leading the marketplace, according to a 2022 study by researchers with China's Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University.Other major seaweed cultivating markets include South Korea, the Philippines and Japan. Isolated and food-challenged North Korea has accounted for 1.68% of the world's seaweed farming, according to Fujian researchers' analysis.Currently, U.S production is barely a blip in the global marketplace.The Western Hemisphere has only accounted for 1.36% of global seaweed/kelp farming the past two decades, according to U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization date cited in the Fujian study.Chile has accounted for 88% of the total.That's where the Cal Poly efforts come in, according to Cuevas Uribe and Zechman.They want to see how their farming efforts work out and whether more cultivation can be brought to California, the Pacific coast and other domestic coastlines.Cuevas Uribe said pollution levels and other external factors such as oil drilling and other commercial marine uses could mean the waters are not clean enough for seaweed farming for food production and other commercial uses.But seaweed aquaculture and its natural filtering could help those same bodies of water - including the dead zones and environmentally challenged areas of the Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay, according to the U.S.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Kelp forests can grow along coastal areas in temperate climates, such as the Puget Sound, helping fish and other marine life, according to NOAA.Seaweed is best grown and cultivated on coastlines with inlets and protected bays.\"It requires fairly calm inland waters,\" Cuevas Uribe said, pointing to places such as the Atlantic coastline of Maine. \"It's got to be sheltered waters.\" \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/CREATIVE COMMONS/JAKUB HA\u00a3UN\n \nSeaweed farmers in Myanmar\n \nRAIYAN I MUHARRAMAH/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS\n \nAsian markets - including China, Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea - accounts for the vast majority of seaweed and kelp aquaculture with projections of global economic boom for the sector.\n \nCOURTESY CAL POLY HUMBOLDT\n \nCal Poly students unload a harvest from Humboldt's commercial, open-water seaweed farm.\n \nPETER SOUTHWOOD/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS\n \nA kelp forest off New Zealand's Hen and Chicken Islands \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The organization educates underserved communities about the growing opportunities in aquaculture, its benefits and sustainability and sustainability's lasting impact.\nBlack, an Easton resident, is an Eastern Shore native through and through and works in oyster restoration. \"I just think there's so much power in a little oyster,\" Black said. \"And they do so much for us. In the water and out of the water.\"\nOysters clean the Chesapeake Bay through filter feeding, which helps clarify the water; nutrient cycling, which allows oysters to process nitrogen in a way that removes it from the water; and through habitat creation, where oyster reefs can provide essential habitat for other marine species.\nHer waterman heritage and Chesapeake culture heavily inspired Black's involvement in this type of work. She said she is proud of her Eastern Shore heritage and seeks to honor her family's legacy by representing the region.\n\"I love being on the Eastern Shore so much,\" Black said. \"I mean, I may not like living here sometimes because we don't have a lot of stuff, but I love the essence and I love the culture.\"\nMinorities in Aquaculture's mission focuses on workforce development. Black said that sometimes, the name can be a deterrent, but once people get past the buzz words of diversity, equity and inclusion, they start to understand the importance of this work.\n\"If we are going to have U.S. seafood competitiveness increasing like this administration wants us to, we're going to need skilled labor to be able to do that,\" she said. \"And so it doesn't really matter if you're Black, white, purple or, whatever, we need you and your skills.\"\nBlack and the 21 members of the coalition went to D.C. to advocate for consensus legislation that aims to create federal regulations and guidelines surrounding aquaculture, such as permitting and site regulations, fish health and welfare measures, labor and equity standards, and climate and sustainability standards.\nBlack said the bill has seen a tremendous amount of support, especially in Maryland and Virginia, but there is excitement and growing interest elsewhere too.\n{p class=\"p1\"}\"I think that people are getting more curious and want to strengthen their connection and understanding to agriculture and what's going on and things like that,\" Black said.\nBlack said if anyone is interested in following along with this new initiative or her other work or wants to get involved, they should visit the website mianpo.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Trades, in his opinion, offer better pay starting out and does not come with enormous debt.\nTo get younger people enthused, he spends his time talking to the high schools.\nHe's doing his part to educate at the college level too, teaching a course on Marine Systems two nights a week, where students learn to install, troubleshoot, diagnose and repair marine equipment and systems.\nThe class consists of some late teens but also boat owners who wish to gain knowledge about the hobby they enjoy.\nIn the classroom, his students have the benefit of learning from a man coming from a long line of shipbuilders. His grandfather on his mother's side, Elmer Rosenblad was a master shipbuilder during World War II.\nHis father, Robert F. Lostrom built wooden boats as well.\nHe carries on that tradition, working in naval architecture and boat building before settling into boat repair.\n\"It's in my blood I guess. I've built 15 types of wooden boats.\"\nBeing born on the Jersey shore was an ideal place to learn those skills. After high school, Lostrom pursued his passion in Kennebunkport, Maine, the location of the infamous Bush compound. In Kennebunkport, at the Landing School Lostrom spent two years of intensive study being instructed on wooden boat building and yacht design.\nGraduating in 1989, he found a way to ply his trade, in Philadelphia at the Independence Seaport Museum.\nHis marine versatility grabbed the attention of Kent County residents, the Johnson family in Quaker Neck. They owned a log canoe that was built in 1890, they wanted restored. After several months, working with a crew, Lostrom completed the job.\nHe remarked it was so efficient it started winning races.\nOver a summer watching the log canoe compete, soaking in the sights and sounds on the Chesapeake Bay, Lostrom said he fell in love with Kent County. He found a job at Higgins Yacht Yard in Saint Michaels around 1995 and has lived on the Eastern Shore ever since.\nWith forty years experience he's a good candidate to keep our elected officials informed about the issues of the business.\nHe was nominated to the board the Marine Trade Association of Maryland board in December.\nA group that consists of marina owners, boat builders and boat suppliers, they lobby with the state on regulations to support the marinas. Lostrom will be helping in the area of workplace development.\nThey'll be addressing all the changes in the industry. An industry, he said which is a luxury business.\nLostrom further described it as a \"sunset dream industry.\"\n\"The people who sail, have a dream view in mind, of having a cocktail and cruising on their boat,\" he added.\nThe business may be luxury, but it is also vital to the economy on the Bay.\nAccording to John Stefancik, executive director of Marine Trades Association of Maryland, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting the recreational marine industry, the annual economic impact to Maryland is $4.2 billion. He estimated that in Kent County that could be tens of millions.\nWith approximately 350 marinas in the state and only 1100 workers, Lostrom sees the challenges ahead.\nThere is lack of experienced skilled trade labor to service customer vessels in a timely manner.\nHe said, \"The customer base has become more 'turnkey' type users putting more demand on skilled labor to keep vessels operating.\"\nFor instance, vacationers might have two weeks to get their yacht in the water. If it's still in the shop for repairs, and the boats are backed up, they might decide to sell it and stop living that specific dream.\nA dream doesn't have to be limited to the boat owners either.\nIt could also be a dream for a lot of young men and women on the Shore, who hunt, fish, boat and love the outdoors.\nA career outside of a cubicle.\nThere is a need for workers, Lostrom said. All marine trades are needed, from mechanics, marine plumbing to administrative work.\nWith a salary range starting at $40,000 that can go upward to $200,000, it could be a good option.\nLostrom pointed to one local success story, a life long employee of his. Under Lostrom, the employee learned about working with wood, received tips on proper use of tools and was instructed on fiberglass repair, engine mechanics and proper maintenance.\nAnd he's doing it where he loves, working outside around the boating environment. And at Haven Harbour, a business that Stefancik indicated is one of the largest marinas in the state.\nBetween balancing the responsibilities of his marina, Lostrom will be lobbying across the state, passionate over his newfound responsibilities.\n\"I want people who read this to know that this is a professional career. A trade that should be treated as such.\"\nIn April, Lostrom will be conducting a career fair; the exact date to be determined later. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "University of Delaware breaks ground on $150M biopharmaceutical manufacturing center\n\n April 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 506\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A new $150 million facility at the University of Delaware will provide a space for testing new biopharmaceutical manufacturing practices as well as train workers in the highly technical skills needed to produce advanced medications.UD, state and federal officials broke ground Monday on the SABRE Center, which stands for Securing American Biomanufacturing Research and Education.\nThe 70,000-square-foot SABRE Center will be located on the STAR Campus next to the Ammon Pinizzotto Biopharmaceutical Innovation Center.\nIt's meant to be an extension of the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL), which is already located on the STAR Campus.\nNIIMBL is a UD-led coalition of nearly 200 companies, educational institutions, nonprofits and state governments. The public-private partnership is designed to accelerate innovation in the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry, which produces vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, gene therapies and other medical products derived from biological sources.\nNIIMBL Director Kelvin Lee said the SABRE Center will allow researchers to further test and refine innovations developed at NIIMBL.\n\"This facility would provide a place where we can actually test how those technologies work in a manufacturing environment,\" Lee said. \"And then if we need to modify or make adjustments to make it more suitable, we then have those lessons learned.\"\nSen. Chris Coons said the COVID-19 pandemic, and the speed at which a vaccine was developed, demonstrated the power of biopharmaceuticals.\n\"What is going to be possible with this institute, with its next phase, is to speed up the cycle of innovation,\" Coons said.\nThat innovation, he said, will give birth to new companies.\n\"Spinning out from that will be a remarkable next generation of opportunities for Delawareans to work in biotech and in manufacturing, for companies to be launched here and regionally,\" Coons said.\nSABRE will also be a training ground for people looking to develop the skills needed to work in high-tech biopharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\"This facility provides an opportunity for people to get trained in how you gown up properly, how you move through a facility properly, how you actually operate pieces of equipment,\" Lee said.\nHaving a skilled workforce here will help attract new pharmaceutical companies to Delaware. UD officials have previously said that the SABRE Center will bring 3,500 jobs to Delaware over the next decade.\n\"Places that have very effective training programs typically find a significant amount of capital investment coming down the road, where companies want to build their factories there because they know they can access a talent pool to staff their factories,\" Lee said.\nSen. Tom Carper said the SABRE Center is an important addition to the STAR Campus, which already boasts 1 million square feet of new development on what used to be the Chrysler assembly plant.\n\"While we're not going to build tanks here anymore, we're not going to build Chrysler products here anymore, we are going to be building facilities that help provide medicines that will make us a healthier country and a healthier world,\" Carper said.\nSo far, the SABRE Center has secured $45 million in investment from the federal government and $30 million from the state.\nLee declined to say when the new facility will open. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Battle lines being drawn for tax fights in 2025\n\n April 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 790\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier this month I joined countless Marylanders in filing my federal and state income tax returns.As I did so, the timeless observations of Benjamin Franklin came to mind: \"In this world nothing is certain except death and taxes.\"\nAfter the Maryland General Assembly adjourned, I suggest Ben was only partly right.\nI suggest that in Maryland, almost certain are new state taxes, state tax increases, new state fees and state fee increases. The only uncertainties about them are when and how much.\nBefore the 2024 Maryland General Assembly adjourned for the year, this matter was discussed at length but never fully settled. Some relatively modest tax and fee increases were approved, but none as large as or as far reaching as expected.\nNone will be approved throughout the balance of this year. The earliest formal discussions on any tax increases can happen is after the General Assembly reconvenes in January 2025.\nBattle lines are already being drawn.\nProponents and opponents of tax increases are busy organizing and promoting their positions. Not surprisingly, there are stark and irreconcilable differences between them.\nThe Maryland Public Policy Institute recently released a statement headlined \"Tax increases Are Never Inevitable.\"\nThe statement includes the following messages: \"Maryland's political leaders would have us believe the state is in a fiscal mess through no fault of their own and that the only solution is massive tax hikes that they've put on hold \u2014 for now. This narrative, however, both misrepresents the problem and ignores a real and preferable solution. When pressed, responsible lawmakers admit that the primary cause of the budget chaos at both state and county levels is the Blueprint for Maryland's Future (a.k.a. Kirwan) education plan. The Spending Affordability Committee projected that budget shortfalls will increase substantially over the next five years \"due to the need for general funds to support costs related to the Blueprint.\"\nThe recommended treatments are to \"minimize the enactment of new mandates,\" increase \"efficiency,\" and \"consider revenue options.\" Sadly, legislators seem focused only on that last tactic \u2014 i.e., tax hikes. But the Blueprint is not Holy Writ etched in stone. And tax hikes on hard-working Marylanders are not inevitable. Instead of pretending to have no way out, lawmakers could choose to alter the Blueprint's mandates or eliminate it altogether.\"\nSupporters of Kirwan especially the Democratic super majorities in the General Assembly and the state teachers' union have a much different view.\nThey support increasing state revenues to a level to ensure Kirwan is fully implemented as it was written when the current version was approved by the General Assembly.\nThey believe they have public support for that. They may be right.\nA recent article in the Baltimore Sun had the following headline: \"Majority of Statewide Voters Support Blueprint for Maryland's Future.\"\nThe article included the following.\n\"An overwhelming majority of Marylanders support the state's ambitious Blueprint for Maryland's Future education plan, according to a new poll done for The Baltimore Sun, the University of Baltimore and FOX45. Nearly three quarters of the 1,300 likely general election voters polled across Maryland said they supported the Blueprint. When the poll asked about potential changes to the plan to lessen its financial pressures on local [education] budgets, 55% said they supported making some reduction, such as cutting all-day prekindergarten programs (24%), or teacher pay raises (11%). However, 29% said they would not cut anything.'\"\nThe professional pollster who conducted the survey opined the results indicate \"profound, widespread\" support among voters for the landmark education plan, tempered by \"a willingness to set adjustments.\nHe further observed, \"It's very hard to argue against public education. The intent [of the Blueprint] tracks with the priorities of Maryland voters.\"\nI suggest the results of this survey, like the results of all surveys, only reflect public sentiment at a point in time. How durable those poll results has yet to be seen.\nThe pollster did acknowledge one huge unresolved issue that cannot be ignored going forward.\nHe said, \"Local school boards will have to balance how to fund their school districts with meeting their Blueprint financial burden, which could force [school board] members to cut local initiatives. Will it force school boards to cut other things? That's where the electoral equation changes.\"\nThat is a key observation that leads to more certainty on discussions and debates on taxes and fees in Maryland.\nBetween now and January 2025, supporters and opponents of Kirwan will be aggressively engaged in efforts to inform, galvanize and mobilize voters to support their respective positions ranging from maintaining Kirwan as presently written, adopting modifications to Kirwan and the necessity for and scope of revenue sources needed to fully fund implantation of whatever the final form Kirwan turns out to be.\nDepending on the outcomes, those efforts may continue well beyond next year.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lierman calls for better support of day care in Maryland\n\n May 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 640\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 On April 26, Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman made a stop to visit the Talbot County Council on her tour of the Eastern Shore. She has been traveling around the state to let different county councils know what the comptroller is up to.Her stops emphasized getting women back into the workplace in Maryland by supporting them with better day care.\nThe council members asked questions after Lierman's 15-minute update.\n\"I have three key roles as comptroller. No. 1 is to act as an elected CFO. To see every dollar in and every dollar out of the state. We also pay all the employees and balance all the books with a general accounting of the state. The second responsibility is that we act as, or I am on, a number of financial boards for the state,\" Lierman said.\nShe said she was on the Board of Public Works, which approves major contracts and any contract or grant over $200,000. She is on the State Retirement and Pension System Board with $65 billion in assets.\nHer third role as comptroller is revenue administrator.\n\"We just finished tax season, and I will give you a little update,\" Lierman said. \"We have processed about $2.7 billion tax returns. We are ahead of schedule from last year. We have sent out refunds to 1.7 million Maryland households.\"\nThen Lierman got into how the Board of Public Works affects Talbot County.\n\"We have approved five projects worth almost $1 million since I took office,\" she said. \"For the renovation and expansion of the St. Michaels Library and a 665-foot living shoreline as well.\"\nShe touted the modernization of her office.\n\"Louis Goldstein used to brag that he took the Office of the Comptroller from pencil and paper to the mainframe. We now we are moving from the mainframe to the cloud. \u2026 The online portal is called Maryland Tax Connect. We launched it in February,\" she said.\nThe number of workers is affecting the state's economic profile.\n\"We are constrained in our economic growth because we don't have the labor force we need. We have seen a lower labor force participation rate in Maryland since the pandemic. Other states have rebounded, and we have not. We have lost around 181,000 workers since COVID,\" she said.\nOne of the key demographics is loss of women in the workforce.\n\"We lost about 2%, and nationally was about 1%. One of the key reasons that we did see, and that was cited, is the cost of child care,\" she said.\nEarlier in the day, Lierman visited Critchlow Adkins Day Care Children's Center of Easton and found that they have a waiting list of over 100 people for their services.\n\"If we are talking about the economy and we are not talking about child care, we are missing a big part of the picture. It is a key piece of economic development,\" she said.\n\"We are the eighth most costly state for child care in the nation right now. We lost a number of child care spots in the pandemic, and we haven't recovered all of them. We need accessible, and affordable and high quality child care available for families who want to have working parents, who need to get out into the workforce,\" Lierman said.\nThe council members had questions for Lierman.\nCouncil member Lynne Mielke asked about affordable housing. Lierman responded with statistics about the population shrinking in Maryland because people are moving away. People are moving from high-cost to low-cost-of-living states.\nShe said the No. 1 reason for people moving is the cost of housing.\n\"The support for housing really comes from the Department of Housing and Community Development budget,\" she said.\n\"Part of your housing crunch is because you have so many short-term rentals. It used to be long-term rentals. You on the Shore face this,\" Lierman said.\nLierman invited those who want to learn more about her office and Maryland's economy to go to marylandtaxes.gov. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We celebrate not only their accomplishments but also the bright futures that each of them is carving out in our community,\" she said.\n\"META is a six month intensive business development and coaching program aimed at providing a cohort of small minority businesses with the resources they need to scale,\" said Sam Shoge, cofounder and partner of Rivers and Roads Consulting, who served as program facilitator and coach.\nThe program intends to close the knowledge resource and funding gap between minority-owned and non-minority owned businesses, he said.\nData is applied across all minority businesses including women-owned and veteran-owned, he said, and the importance of the program is noted in the disparities between minority and non-minority owned businesses, he said.\nThe average revenue of black sole proprietorships versus non-minority sole proprietorships is $22,000 versus $50,000 respectively, according to Shoge.\nOn average non-minority owned businesses are six times larger than black-owned businesses, he said.\nA total of 15 applications from women and minority owned businesses were received in 2023 and five Queen Anne's County businesses were selected to participate in the inaugural program, he said.\nParticipants included Moniesha Baynard, owner of Three Guys and a Girl Personal Chef and Catering; Diane Moorman-White, owner of DMW Soul Fitness; Timeka Wheeler, owner of Long Live Assisted Living; Deayna Ewell, owner of Onyx Beauty Supply Salon Barbershop; and Ebony Johnson, owner of Tips and Toes Nail Studio.\nThe six-month program at the Kent Island Library began its first seminar in February 2024 and concluded in August.\nMETA entailed monthly business development seminars including a variety of topics such as market strategy, business planning, sales and customer service, bookkeeping best practices, licensing and regulation as well as personal coaching, Shoge said.\nA key aspect of the program was how entrepreneurs can partner and collaborate and support fellow community small businesses, he said.\n\"Our secretary of commerce Secretary (Micheal) Gill always said that economic development is a team sport and that is very much reflected in this program here,\" Shoge said.\nOfficials were very happy with the outcome and success of the program, with many participants reporting increased revenues, Shoge said.\nTransitioning from a 36-year veterinary career, participant Moorman-White, credited the program with giving her the push and the confidence to prove to herself she could turn her \"side-gig\" into a full time career.\n\"Probably the biggest thing the META program has done for me was it changed my mindset. I am now recognizing the power I possess to achieve my goals both big and small,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The facility will have a gym, tech lab, game room and classrooms. It will also have a museum and cultural center to honor the area's African American history during and following segregation.\n\"We have a lot of work to do,\" Jeff Breslin, president and CEO of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Metropolitan Baltimore, said during a Dorchester Chamber of Commerce luncheon on Oct. 29. \"We're still fundraising every single day.\"\nWith about $8 million raised so far, Breslin said there is a $4.5 million funding gap. He said they feel confident in getting $3 million of that funding and so they are pushing for the final $1.5 million.\nBreslin said so far, the building \u2014 which is the vacant Mace's Lane High School \u2014 has had its roof and windows replaced and its facade updated. He said there have been remediation efforts inside, including asbestos removal.\n\"But really, we're just about shovel-ready to get the inside done,\" he said in an interview.\nBreslin said the start of the project's third phase, which they hope to begin in early 2025, is dependent on funding.\nThe Rev. Keith Cornish said raising the remaining funds for the project will ensure \"everyone wins.\"\n\"Every part of our society will be impacted,\" he said about the community center.\nCornish is board president of Mace's Lane Community Center, a nonprofit that was formed by the Good Shepherd Association and the Mace's Lane High School Alumni Association. He compared the Boys and Girls Club at Mace's Lane Community Center to fertilizer for the school system.\n\"When they come alongside and help the school system, everyone benefits,\" he said.\nBreslin said across the country, every dollar invested in the Boys and Girls Clubs returns $10.32 in economic benefits to club members, their families and society. He said in Maryland, every dollar invested in the Boys and Girls Clubs returns $7.64.\nBreslin said that since opening the Boys and Girls Club at Leonards Lane in Cambridge in 2021, there has been a 35% decrease in juvenile crime within 0.3 miles of the club. He said that percentage has been controlled for recent juvenile reform laws.\n\"Ultimately it just means that when kids have somewhere safe and predictable and hopeful to go, we know what it does for the community,\" Breslin said.\nDuring the lunch, Breslin introduced Leonards Lane Club Manager Gabe Butler and the organization's Manager of Community and Youth Support Kentavius Jones.\nButler said when kids come into the club, they are given dinner and time for homework help and tutoring before going through Boys and Girls Club programming.

This was the site of lunch and learn for the Caroline County Women in Business.\nIt was a fun moment of delight to see and touch these creatures from the Andes.\n\"Look at them following her. This is hilarious,\" Tracey Snyder, director of the Caroline County Chamber of Commerce, said.\n\"We love the alpaca farm. This is the second time the chamber has been here.

She is going to show us how to be a little more zen in our hectic lives,\" Snyder said.\nOwner of Outstanding Dreams Alpaca Farm Phil Liske gave a talk on the animal's behavior.\nAfter the animal interaction, it was time to listen to the keynote speaker, healer Michelle Boulden Hammond.\n\"We are talking about mindfulness today. It is a peaceful forum and how to handle stress today. Some spiritual message like how to learn about frequencies. Learn about how to get yourself grounded. We will learn stress management techniques,\" Hammond said.\nShe said it is even beneficial for the animals and their frequencies. She specializes in sound healing.\n\"We are going to do a little breath work. I have got my sound bowls. I got my tuning forks and I have my ocean drum. So I will give a little demonstration. I have a brass and I have a crystal bowl,\" Hammond said.\nShe also had a comment on the current moment.\n\"In these times of high stress, there is a lot of hostility. You have got to learn to get grounded and centered.

Jay Jacobs (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said in an interview with the Star Democrat.\nThe state is facing a predicted $2.7 billion budget deficit in fiscal year 2026. Jacobs said when it comes to the budget process this year, he thinks everything will be on the table. \"The devil is in the details,\" he said.\n\"We're certainly \u2014 on the Shore \u2014 fiscal conservatives concerned with any cost increase, any tax increase or any cost toward citizens,\" Jacobs said.\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said he hopes state Democrats realize that some state goals, such as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and some climate initiatives, are unrealistic and need to be reexamined.\n\"So I hope there's some reality checks,\" he said.\nDel. Jefferson Ghrist (R- Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said the state has overspent. He said although House leadership seems to be ok with raising taxes to balance the budget, the governor might not be \"comfortable\" with that.\nGhrist said he expects to see a \"clash\" in the Democratic Party regarding the budget.\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) sees this legislative session as a \"defining\" one for Gov. Wes Moore (D).\n\"He's going to have to balance this out within his own party,\" Mautz said about Moore. \"Because the policies that are in place now that have caused these economic problems largely come from the Democratic Party and Democratic leadership.\"\nBLUEPRINT FOR MARYLAND'S FUTUREThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future is another issue that legislators on the Shore expect to be one of the top issues this legislative session.\nThe Blueprint \u2014 a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and education quality across the state \u2014 has garnered some concern across the state due to funding challenges.\nHutchinson said that with a budget shortfall, the state should be \"pulling back\" on the Blueprint. He said the plan has \"been devastating\" to counties across the state.\nJacobs said he thinks this legislative session will result in adjustments to the timeline of certain Blueprint goals.\n\"I don't think that they're going to do away with Blueprint by any means,\" he said. \"I just think that there may be some changes in the timeline of different parts of it.\"\nMautz said \"something has to happen\" with the Blueprint. He said he isn't sure if legislators will create bills \"to address the damage that's been done\" or create bills that put pauses on the plan.\nENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTFrom solar energy to electric vehicles, Eastern Shore legislators see energy and environment issues as important heading into this legislative session.\nGhrist called the state's renewable energy goals \"virtually impossible to achieve.\" He said he has concerns about who is controlling where solar energy systems are being placed in the state. He plans to put out \"several\" bills that address solar energy.\n\"Our number one industry is agriculture and it's being threatened right now by solar,\" he said.\nJacobs said he has heard that there have been some \"serious conversations\" about expanding nuclear energy in the state. He said he hopes state leadership and legislative committees that deal with energy issues will look more into nuclear energy and figure out if it's a direction the state should be going in.\nWhen it comes to electric vehicles, Hutchinson said he doesn't think the state has the capacity for its electric vehicle initiatives.\n\"There's not enough power stations to be able to charge them,\" he said. \"And based upon what I'm hearing from our local dealers, there's not a market for them and they want to stay with combustible engines.\"\nHutchinson said he expects a lot of debate this session.\n\"And again, I hope that we see some reality coming that we can't continue to afford to spend and that we have to make sure we address this $2.7 billion short fall that's going to get worse and worse each year if we don't do anything today,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "State of State ignores Eastern Shore realities\n\n February 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JOHNNY MAUTZ | Section: Columns \n \n 452\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Gov. Moore's recent State of the State address painted a rosy picture of Maryland's future, but as your state senator, I need to be straight with you about where we really stand.Maryland currently ranks 43rd in economic outlook and faces a staggering $3 billion deficit that could balloon to $7 billion by 2030. This crisis wasn't created by Gov. Hogan or the Trump administration \u2014 it's the predictable result of expensive, unfunded policies and overregulation pushed through by the Democratic supermajority in Annapolis.\nThe most glaring omission from the governor's hourlong speech? The crushing cost of living hitting Eastern Shore families right now, especially those sky-high utility bills. His solution is to raise taxes on businesses and high earners, but we all know those costs always find their way down to workers, consumers, and our local businesses.\nLet's break down what's really happening in Annapolis:\nInstead of cutting wasteful programs, the governor wants to raise taxes and increase spending. Maryland already has one of the worst tax burdens in the country. His budget talks about job creation but ignores how businesses keep fleeing to states with lower taxes and fewer regulations.\nThe governor doubled down on the Blueprint for Maryland's Future \u2014 a massive unfunded mandate our counties and state can't afford. His proposed $1.6 billion in savings falls woefully short when we're facing a $4 billion annual shortfall to implement it.\nRather than working to control costs, the state has unleashed almost universal increases for licenses and other fees, accompanied by aggressive property tax assessment increases. Aspirational environmental mandates are being reenforced rather than reexamined, while they continue to drive costs. This includes their enormous impact on agriculture in comparison to the meager and in many instances, unmeasurable benefits. Meanwhile, the economy on the Chesapeake Bay has been strangled by poor management strategies that range across the board from the blue crab fishery to migratory waterfowl.\nHere are a couple immediate actions to cut costs: eliminate thousands of funded, vacant positions; repeal costly mandates in the Blueprint that have not been implemented; cut wasteful spending like the Red Line Study and mass transit; and stop the new $2 billion annual payroll tax for paid family leave. Finally, there must be some incentive for agencies to save money rather than exhaust budgets to ensure they are funded in the following year.\nMeanwhile, crime is a very real problem in Maryland and while ending recidivism is essential, the lack of attention and urgency over repeat offenders is alarming. The Eastern Shore way has always been practical and commonsense, there are options that support economic growth, environmental and educational improvement, and promote public safety without breaking the bank. That's what we should be supporting \u2014 not costly mandates from Annapolis. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Shore legislators worry about tax hikes, energy, education in the wake of General Assembly\n\n April 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 802\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The Maryland General Assembly session officially ended Monday night. Lawmakers fought through a very tough fiscal year budget, which had some significant impacts for Eastern Shore communities, legislators said.Members of the Eastern Shore delegation stressed budget difficulties loom over state lawmakers, who spent much of this year's session tackling an over $3 billion deficit.\n\"I think the session was not a good session,\" Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said. \"We've just made Maryland a very expensive, more expensive than it was, and it's going to make us less competitive in the region.\n\"If you believe that economic competitiveness is in fact a priority, I think that it is, and I think that by raising taxes and fees, both at the state level and then forcing the locals to also increase their fees and taxes is a double whammy.\"\nMaryland lawmakers passed a balanced budget Monday, concluding their spring session after months of grappling with the deficit. The final budget included about $2 billion in cuts and about $1.6 billion in tax hikes.\n\"I think we left frustrated that we had to raise taxes $1.66 billion and there was no regard to wanting to really seriously cut expenses from the state budget,\" said Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico).\nEastern Shore Delegation members believe after this year's session, the Shore will see lasting effects both fiscally and in several key industries.\nSolar\nOne of the biggest concerns for the Mid-Shore this budget session has been solar energy.\nA renewable energy bill aimed at increasing generation of energy within the state by promoting solar energy production was passed by both chambers of the state legislature.\nSome Eastern Shore Delegation members feel provisions added to these bills during legislators' deliberations supersede counties' authority regarding solar permitting and regulation.\n\"It undermines all the work that the counties have already done to try to facilitate where and how to put solar,\" Mautz said. \"It includes a new assessment for planting solar, which is going to raise energy costs.\"\nHutchinson echoed this sentiment, saying, \"It falls on deaf ears that the Democrats from Montgomery and Prince George's county all think that they know how the quality of life is here on the Eastern Shore.\"\nUtility bills\nHouse Bill 1035 and Senate Bill 937, known collectively as the \"Next Generation Energy Act,\" include plans to reduce energy bills and address shortfalls by modernizing the state's energy infrastructure and incentivizing in-state energy production.\nEastern Shore Delegation members believe this effort to get the cost down lacked the immediacy rate payers need to address bill hikes.\n\"We have not addressed the number one complaint I received when I arrived in January,\" Hutchinson said, \"rate payers calling to say that their electric bills are astronomical. We put legislation forward to try to lower utility bills, and again, it falls on deaf ears.\"\nEducation funding\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Futue, the state's education improvement and funding initiative through 2032, originally outlined an increase in teacher collaborative time, during which teachers are not in classes and can plan, grade or meet with students individually. But with adjustments made in the state's budget to combat the deficit, funding to implement the change has been postponed.\nThe Blueprint also sustained several other cuts and freezes that impact county finances. Multiple Mid-Shore county school boards have had to make budget cut decisions and potential layoffs in response.\n\"So let me take Dorchester County, for example,\" Hutchinson said. \"They pushed down the teachers' pensions. They pushed down the Blueprint. They pushed down other mandates that the state usually paid for, but now it's all the county, they have to pay for (it).\"\n\"The school board is short about $5 million. They just eliminated summer school,\" he said. \"They're looking at having to lay off student support personnel. They say we want to create a world-class education. Yet you look at the results of what's happening in Maryland and say that doesn't make sense.\"\nPotential special sessions\nWhile the 2025 session has ended, Mautz doesn't believe discussion is officially over.\nAs the federal government continues to shift funding priorities, state legislators may need to reconvene to address any impacts this has on the balanced budget, he said.\n\"Counties are probably going to have to raise revenue through taxes and different things,\" Mautz said. \"The federal government is probably going to continue to reduce spending. Then there's a high likelihood that we're going to have a special session.\"\n\"So we would have to go back to Annapolis again to address any changes that that come from federal spending reductions. Just as the federal government is reducing its spending, the state is doing the same thing to the counties, and so where all this ends, it seems to be, taxpayer, taxpayer, taxpayer.\n\"Everybody should know it's very hard to predict how this is all going to play out, but I don't think the discussion about the budget is is officially over.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Court rules digital ad tax violates First Amendment\n\n August 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BRYAN P. SEARS Maryland Matters | Section: State News \n \n 461\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A provision in Maryland's digital ad tax is an unconstitutional restriction on free speech, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.The 2021 law \u2014 the first of its kind in the nation \u2014 imposes taxes on large tech companies for the digital ads they sell within the state. But it prohibits those companies from passing the tax on to consumers as a surcharge, fee or line item on their bills \u2014 what a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals saw as a ban on telling customers about the new added tax.\nIn a ruling that invoked American protests against the Colonial-era Stamp Act, Circuit Judge Julius Richardson wrote that, as then, \"complaining about taxes remains a grand American political tradition.\" And the court said Maryland lawmakers went too far by adding language to the tax bill that was intended to shield them from public criticism.\n\"Perhaps fearing such complaints, Maryland paired its tax with another rule,\" Richardson wrote for the court. \"Companies that make money advertising on the internet must not only pay the tax, but avoid telling their customers how it affects pricing: No line items, no surcharges, no fees.\n\"If companies pass on the cost of the tax, they must do so in silence \u2014 keeping customers in the dark about why prices have gone up and thereby insulating Maryland from political responsibility,\" he wrote.\nThe ruling reverses a 2024 decision by U.S. District Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby, who agreed with the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of tech firms and business associations \u2014 that the law created some First Amendment issues. But she let the law stand because the offending provision had \"many constitutional applications.\"\nFriday's circuit court ruling sent the case back to Griggsby with instructions to determine an appropriate remedy for the plaintiffs.\nThe ruling is a blow to officials who looked to the unique tax to help pay for expensive K-12 education reforms contained in the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. Expenses associated with that law continue to rise and are potentially budget busting \u2014 even if the digital ad tax survives the onslaught of legal challenges.\nThe 2021 law \u2014 sponsored by Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) \u2014 targets big tech firms including Apple, Meta and Google.\nUnder the law, companies reporting $100 million of gross global annual revenue are subject to a 2.5% levy. The tax increases in increments of 2.5% to a maximum rate of 10% levied against companies reporting more than $15 billion in gross global revenue.\nThe state could collect as much as $250 million annually from the digital ad tax, according to a legislative analysis. The funds are earmarked for the education reform program.\nNeither Ferguson nor Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D), the defendant in the lawsuit, immediately responded to requests for comment on the ruling Friday. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The forum included a presentation by Cambridge resident and environmental advocate Susan Olsen, a Q & A and a moderated discussion.Olsen's presentation outlined what climate change is and its affects on the Eastern Shore before diving in to discuss Maryland's Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022.\"We are doing a great job in Maryland,\" Olsen said. \"The Climate Solutions Now Act of '22 is the most ambitious greenhouse gas reduction program in our country.\" The act requires the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions through setting new goals and developing emissions reduction requirements.Olsen said environmental justice is a large part of the environmental bills being passed.She said the Climate Solutions Now Act uses tax incentives to encourage community solar for low and moderate income Marylanders.Community solar gives utility customers who rent or are unable to purchase solar panels the option to power their homes with solar energy through a subscription, according to the Maryland Office of People's Counsel.\"It's wonderful,\" Olsen said. \"It really is.\" Olsen ended her presentation by sharing how residents can be a part of the solution in Dorchester County and on the Eastern Shore.She mentioned tree grants from the state's 5 Million Trees Initiative. The grants can pay for trees that are planted in public areas. Olsen said that folks who are interested in getting involved with planting trees can look into the ShoreRivers Tree Stewards program.Other ways to get involved include joining environmental groups or lobbying for the implementation, compliance and enforcement of the Climate Solutions Now Act.Olsen also talked about her experience trying to get Dorchester County Public Schools on board with electric buses. She said the Environmental Protection Agency has been giving out grants to school districts to trade in their diesel school buses for electric, propane or low-emission buses.\"Last year, we were a priority district,\" Olsen said about Dorchester County Public Schools.\"They would pay the full cost of the buses.\" However, Olsen said the Dorchester County Board of Education decided against switching to zero-and low-emission buses.Maris Wicker, who attended the forum, said she remembers when the Board was discussing this.\"I was very disappointed to learn that there was not a move toward electric buses,\" Wicker said. \"I thought it could have been a great learning moment for kids riding school buses.\" Olsen said that while Dorchester County is no longer a priority district for this grant - meaning the EPA would only fund a percentage of the cost of each bus-it is still possible for the district to get involved with the program.Sarah Gavian, chair of the Dorchester Dems Committee, said she could see a group of advocates coming together for this issue.\"I think there probably is a lot of momentum around things that could be done to support at least understanding what Dorchester can win and lose from (with electric) school buses,\" Gavian said. \"I think (we could) probably find some advocates in this room to work with Susan on this.\" Forum attendees also talked about how to improve and increase recycling in the area.During her presentation, Olsen said that recycling correctly can decrease the amount of methane, a greenhouse gas, in landfills.Miriam Zijp said that when it comes to recycling in Dorchester County, the problem is information.\"People don't know how to recycle,\" Zijp said. \"But they don't get taught.\" Zijp suggested creating programs to teach children how to recycle.\"You have to start somewhere,\" she said. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nMary Dennard-Turner talks about recycling at a forum on climate change hosted by the Dorchester Dems on Aug. 2 at the organization's headquarters in Cambridge. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gov. Aruna Miller. \"The growth of this program is essential; it not only addresses the urgency required by an escalating climate crisis, but it closely aligns with our administration's commitment to service and to empowering our youth to gain real-world professional skills.\" The Class of 2022-2023 was made up of students from Allegany, Anne Arundel, Caroline, Howard, Montgomery, Talbot, Washington and Worcestor counties and Baltimore City.They were addressed briefly by seven special guests: Miller, Comptroller Brooke Lierman, Maryland Senate President William Ferguson, Maryland Senator Pamela Beidle, Maryland Energy Administration Director Paul Pinsky, BGE Sr. Vice President Alexander Nunez, and Chesapeake Bay Trust President Dr. Jana Davis. Each speaker touched on the potential each of the graduates have to continue the fight to protect Maryland's environment and the restoration efforts of the Chesapeake Bay.Pinsky told the graduates, \"Never doubt what you can do to change things for the better. A group of young people in Wyoming brought action in court to protect the environment there. Those young people are the same ages you are. You do the same thing they did, if the cause arises.\" Beidle also focused on the power of individuals. Quoting Margaret Mead, she said, \"The power and influence of one person has always been the force for change throughout history.\" The CCCC was created by the Maryland General Assembly in 2010. It is administered by the Chesapeake Bay Trust. The multi-faceted expansion of the program to include more intentional climate work is possible due to the additional $1.5 million per year investment from the State of Maryland.CCCC provides career and leadership training for young people interested in environmental careers.Corps members are matched with non-profit and government host organizations and receive firsthand training on a wide variety of topics on the realms of climate, energy, watershed restoration, agriculture, forestry and education.\"The goal of our Corps program is to create future generations of environmental stewards who are poised to address climate change and other environmental challenges, either in their personal or professional lives or both,\" Davis said. \"I am so proud of these amazing young people. Their efforts not only serve the environment, but also boost local economies and revitalize often underserved neighborhoods.\" The 55 selected 2023-24 Chesapeake Conservations and Climate Corps participants will serve this year in Anne Arundel, Charles, Calvert, Garrett, Howard, Kent, Montgomery, Prince George's, Talbot and Worcester counties, and Baltimore City. \n \n Caption: DOUG BISHOP/BAY TIMES AND RECORD OBSERVER\n \nMembers of the 2022-2023 Chesapeake Conservation and Climate Corps receive the symbolic golden shovel from previous graduates following their graduation, Tuesday, Aug. 15, at the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Center in Grasonville.

The Farm to Bay Trail winds its way through cool season grass meadows, warm season grass meadows, brackish wetlands, freshwater wetlands, pine forest, emergent hardwood forest, mature hardwood forest and gives up close views of agriculture on Delmarva on a working farm.While exploring the habitats, about half of the trail borders agriculture fields while the other half borders brackish Pickering Creek.The trail affords a rare opportunity to experience most of the rural, coastal plain's habitats in one place coexisting with agriculture successfully. Interpretive panels along the Farm to Bay Trail tell the story of Delmarva's key ecosystems and species.In the fall of 2022, Pickering Creek received a grant from the Rural Maryland Council to support creation of new messaging and new artwork for nine interpretive panels. People visit places like Pickering Creek Audubon Center to learn, explore, find adventure, relax and exercise.Interpretive panels help give meaning to the visitors experience by telling the story of the land: past, present and future. Interpretive panels help draw connections between habitats, plants, wildlife and people.The panels highlight the key habitats along the Center's Farm to Bay Trail, which include forest, wetland, meadow, agriculture and brackish water creek. Through the panels we tell the story of key habitat features, flora and fauna through both concise written messages and compelling visuals. Panels help the visitor understand the interconnected nature of land and water on Delmarva.The panels replace aging panels that have been weathered by the sun and rain. None of the existing panels were replicated, so each of the nine panels shares a brand new story about the center, its wildlife and habitats. In addition to replacing existing panels, the new panels fill in spots along the trails that have not been previously highlighted.Over the course of the past year, center staff researched, designed, contracted fabrication and installed nine interpretive panels. At the Center's entrance parking area you will now be greeted by a timeline history of the center that explains its donation and evolution over time.New panels along the Farm to Bay Trail highlight songbirds in the woods, no till agriculture, the importance of forested buffers between land and water, fungi of the woods and birds seen on the creek.New panels along the Wetland and Meadow Trails highlight which amphibians you are likely to see and hear, the importance of milkweed in meadow communities, and bluebird boxes and their benefits.\"Pickering Creek is unique as a nature center in that we are also agricultural landowners. As the Olds Family who donated the center's core property wished we continued to highlight agriculture as part of the landscape on Delmarva while also sharing how conservation practices coexist with great habitat for wildlife,\" said Center Director Mark Scallion.Pickering Creek is open to the public daily during daylight hours. Check the center website for exact open times as evening daylight gets shorter this fall.There are several viewing platforms and blinds along the way for you to enjoy scenery and wildlife.Benches for resting are spread throughout the trails. The new panels join seven existing panels that have been installed in the last five years in both wetland and meadow habitats.Together they share the story of outdoor habitats and ecosystems and the creatures we share them with on Delmarva. \n \n Caption: Keep an eye out for mushrooms growing high on trees!\n \nSpecies like this Dryad Saddle (right) or Cracked Cap Polypore (above) can grow dozens of feet off the ground on standing snags.\n \n\"There is Fungus Among Us\" is one of the new interpretive panels.\n \nSome species of fungus grow directly in the ground. These species, like this Russula species (above), are seeking nutrients like nitrogen that are already in the soil and therefore don't need to grow on wood.\n \nLook around our forests and you'll find some kind of mushroom. Coming in all colors of the rainbow, most mushrooms are easy to see but they are only the fruiting body of the fungus or mycelium. Mycelium, which look like thin roots or strands of hair, help to break down organic material like leaves and wood for food which recycles the nutrients back into the soil for other plants!\n \nCheck fallen logs for mushrooms. Many mushrooms like the False Turkey Tails (right top) and Bonnet species (right below) can only grow out of dead wood so fallen logs and branches are crucial! \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He has been leading the university's commitment to unbiased scientific research and public service while developing the next generation of environmental scientists since 2017.\"The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science is a very special community within a unique institution driven by a common mission driven by truly exceptional researchers and staff,\" Goodwin said. \"It has been the honor of a lifetime to lead UMCES toward its second century of impact in Maryland and around the world.\"An internationally known expert in ecosystem restoration, he has championed bringing together the best available science around issues of coastal resilience, oyster recovery, ecosystem management, and using large-scale environmental data in decision-making to Maryland. As part of UMCES' longtime role to advise the state on Chesapeake Bay management and restoration programs, he has served an integral role on the Governor's Chesapeake Bay Cabinet, as well as lead science advisor on the Maryland Commission on Climate Change. He has been a consistent leading voice associated with expanding Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives not only within UMCES but throughout the environmental sciences.\"President Goodwin's leadership of UMCES has been vitally important to the state and to the nation, as the science coming out of his institution guides the approach to our shared environmental and climate challenges,\" said University System of Maryland Chancellor Jay A. Perman. \"President Goodwin's compelling vision for UMCES, his skill in developing the next generation of talented and diverse environmental scientists, his well-earned influence in Annapolis, which advances better policy and practice - all of it will be greatly missed. I thank him for the exceptionally strong foundation he's laid for UMCES' dynamic future.\"A globally eminent research institution aimed at advancing scientific knowledge of the environment, UMCES has a unique mandate from the state of Maryland to conduct scientific research and provide sound advice to help leaders manage Maryland's natural resources. Since its establishment in 1925, UMCES has played a key role in expanding our understanding of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem and is known for tracking progress on its restoration.UMCES addresses some of the most pressing environmental challenges facing society nationally and internationally and prepares future scientists to meet the global challenges of the 21st century through the Marine Estuarine and Environmental Sciences (MEES) graduate program, as well as other educational offerings.\"On behalf of the Board of Visitors, we have greatly enjoyed working with Peter to advance UMCES these years. He has moved this institution forward in so many ways,\" said outgoing Board of Visitors Chair Charlie Monk. \"Thank you for giving us the opportunity to share our ideas and support your vision for this unique institution.\"Perman has appointed longtime UMCES Vice President Bill Dennison as interim president, effective Sept. 25. He will serve in that capacity until a permanent replacement is named by the Search and Screening Committee appointed by the USM for the UMCES, one of the university system's 12 institutions. \n \n Caption: AMY PELSINSKY/UNIVERSITY OF MARY LAND CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE\n \nUniversity of Maryland Center for Environmental Science President Peter Goodwin retires after 40 years in science and higher education. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Sultana Education Foundation held a ribbon cutting ceremony for its new Lawrence Wetlands Preserve this week.Drew McMullen, President of the Sultana Education Foundation located in Chestertown, said the educational programs provided by the foundation show how the Chesapeake Bay includes wetlands, shoreline, and now the watershed. \"We can now show the connection between land and water,\" he said.Under development since 2017, the Lawrence Wetlands Preserve is an 8.5-acre urban nature center that features a variety of ecosystems including upland forest, swamp, marsh, shrublands, meadows, and a freshwater pond. In addition to its natural elements, the property boasts an accessible trail network, wetland boardwalk, viewing platforms, an activity field, and the 1,200-square-foot Harwood Nature Center.The land was purchased from Washington College in 2017.McMullen told the ribbon-cutting guests that already the foundation has provided over 200,000 students from the Eastern Shore and 15 other counties hands-on lessons, \"now that the center is open new programs start next week.\" Joining the ribbon cutting team were state Senator Stephen Hershey, state Delegate Jay Jacobs, National Park Service Planning and Development Manager Bob Campbell, Chestertown Councilman Albert Nickerson, and Kent County Superintendent of Schools Dr. Karen Couch.Jacobs, a Kent County resident, took a tour of the area before the project began. \"I've seen the before and after, and it's remarkable\" he said. As for funding they received from the state, Jacobs said, \"It speaks to the credibility of the Sultana foundation that they were able to get that kind of funding level - when you get what you want when you want it.\" \"We are grateful to Mr.Lawrence and the individuals, foundations, and government agencies that made the creation of the Preserve possible,\" commented Sultana Board Chair Robert Hindman. \"We're thrilled to have created a resource that will enhance the Foundation's environmental education programs while serving as a green space for the entire community.\" Several state and federal agencies awarded sizable grants to the project including the Maryland General Assembly, the National Park Service, Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, the Maryland Heritage Areas Authority, the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, and the Stories of the Chesapeake Heritage Area.The Lawrence Wetlands Preserve will host environmental literacy programs and professional development opportunities for 3,000 students and teachers annually, with a focus on PreK through fifth grade. The Preserve will often be used in conjunction with activities taking place at other locations on Sultana's Chestertown campus, including its LEED Platinum Holt Education Center, the schooner SULTANA, and canoe and kayak trips based out of Wilmer Park.When not in use for programs, the Preserve will serve as a contact point for the National Park Service's Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, host programs for the public, and be open for general visitation daily from dusk to dawn.Kent County Superintendent Dr. Karen Couch said McCullen was one of the first people she met when she came to the county. \"I found we weren't accessing the foundation like we should. Together we worked diligently to provide students valuable lessons to become good environmental stewards,\" said Couch.All KCPS students from pre-k through grade eight have had at least one activity with the foundation. Using the Maryland state science standards, plans are for all first grades to visit and study bird adaptations; for all third graders to student pond ecology, and all eighth graders to study soil and water chemistry.\"This is hands-on learning by doing,\" said Couch. These lessons will stay with them the rest of their lives.\" Said Hershey, \"It's important that students learn how things work outside of the classroom. A lot of us would have loved to get these opportunities when we were young.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nState Delegate Jay Jacobs, State Senator Stephen Hershey, Kent County Schools Superintendent Dr. Karen Couch, Kent County Commissioner Albert Nickerson, National Park Service Planning and Development Manager Bob Campbell, and Drew McMullen, president of the Sultana Education Foundation cut the ribbon to open the Lawrence Wetlands Preserve in Chestertown. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Officials tout Bay education and funding bill\n\n October 19, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Shifra Dayak; Capital News Service | Page: A4 | Section: News \n \n 603\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - A House panel held a hearing Wednesday on a bill that would boost Chesapeake Bay restoration and environmental education programs.The Chesapeake Bay Science, Education, and Ecosystem Enhancement Act of2023, sponsored by Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, would reauthorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Chesapeake Bay office for the first time since 2006.Congress has appropriated funds to the NOAA office each year, but an official reauthorization would allow the office to more efficiently carry out Chesapeake Bay restoration and monitoring initiatives, Sarbanes told the House Natural Resources Committee's water, wildlife and fisheries subcommittee.\"In recent decades, the health of the Chesapeake Bay has been negatively affected by nutrient runoff across the watershed, disappearing coastal and marine habitats and many other factors,\" Sarbanes said. \"That makes the passage of the Chesapeake Bay SEEE act all the more important.\"The bill would also enhance NOAA's interpretive buoy system, which collects data on water quality, weather patterns and more; enhance NOAA's aquaculture programs that aim to support marine habitats and workers in the seafood industry; and finance grants for hands-on environmental education in kindergarten through 12th grade classrooms in the region.This bill, introduced in the summer, \"could not come at a more critical time,\" according to Allison Colden, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's executive director.\"There's still much work to be done,\" Colden said. \"To achieve meaningful and lasting restoration we need all of our federal partners at the table.\"Colden pointed to the NOAA Chesapeake Bay office's positive track record on oyster restoration projects, citing the bill as an avenue to continue such initiatives in the future by ensuring the office has financial stability.NOAA staff are working to restore oysters in 11 tributaries in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and have completed restoration across more than 1,900 acres, according to a tracker by the Chesapeake Bay Program.\"The scale of this work is really unprecedented,\" Carrie Selberg Robinson, the director of NOAA's habitat conservation office, said of the oyster conservation efforts. \"We want to continue to build upon our successes that we've had and continue this great work of oyster restoration into the future.\"Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Virginia, who co-sponsored the bill, also praised its potential impact on furthering oyster restoration projects.\"Large scale oyster restoration is really Mother Nature's filter in taking a lot of stuff out of the bay that would otherwise take years and years to do,\" Wittman said.The Chesapeake Bay SEEE Act comes amid other efforts this congressional session to restore the health of the nation's largest estuary.Sarbanes also sponsored a bill that would designate the bay as a national recreation area under the National Park Service. Wittman sponsored a bill that would fund conservation initiatives in the watershed, such as a pilot project to plant riparian buffers.The latest Sarbanes-Wittman bill includes provisions to instill stewardship values into students, allowing for bay restoration to continue in the longterm, witnesses told the subcommittee. If passed, the bill would continue to fund NOAA's Chesapeake Bay-Watershed Education and Training Program, which provides grants for environmental education in the watershed.Witnesses faced slight pushback on the bill from Rep. Cliff Bentz, R-Ore-gon - the ranking member of the subcommittee - who called for supporters to provide more specific metrics about the benefits of environmental education.Colden said that the Chesapeake Bay Foundation will provide the subcommittee with numbers ahead of further movement on the bill, but added that the positives of teaching children about caring for the bay are evident.\"We're building the workforce that can continue the work of Chesapeake Bay restoration,\" Colden said. \"It's so incredibly important to make that investment in our next generation of bay stewards.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some animals respond and some don't. Right now, it's a question that nobody seems to have a complete answer to.\"\nThe Texas A&M researcher said animals at a zoo in South Carolina showed varying reactions to an eclipse in 2017 \u2014 including some that began nighttime preparations, some that looked to the sky and others who displayed signs of anxiety or unusual activities.\n\"Researchers saw giraffes suddenly start running around their pen,\" Dykes said. \"Some of the male gorillas became more aggressive. These were some of the anxiety behaviors.\"\n\"For birds, they would suddenly go to nest and then a few minutes later, when the sun came back out, they would seem to start their day all over again,\" he said. \"There's no telling what's running through these critters' minds when, suddenly midday, the sky goes dark. Their environment is always having an influence, whether through rain, temperature, wind speed, the amount of sunlight or the length of day. Wildlife are deeply in tune with their surroundings.\"\nResearchers from other universities as well as students and teachers from high schools will also be studying animal and wildlife behaviors.\nThat includes a contingent from North Carolina State University who will be part of a research effort at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas during the April 8 eclipse.\nAdam Hartstone-Rose, a biology professor at North Carolina State, was also at the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden in Columbia, South Carolina in 2017.\nHe's excited for the 2024 total solar eclipse to see how animals react.\nThe researchers welcome input from others who see how farm animals, dogs and cats and other wildlife react during the cosmic happening.\n\"We're interested not only in figuring out which animals react to the eclipse and how, but (to) what extent of totality is necessary to cause a reaction,\" Hartsone-Rose said.\n\"We're really excited about getting data from people that might be at farms or cattle ranches,\" he said. \"We're hoping that people will go out into the woods and see what squirrels, deer and birds are doing. And I'm really excited about people just observing their pets in their backyard.\"\nThe eclipse will be visible to varying degrees across the U.S. with a path of totality where the moon will completely darken the sun for three to four minutes stretching from Texas and Oklahoma and into Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, upstate New York and New England.\nOvercast conditions and stormy weather could impact how visible the eclipse is in parts of the country \u2014 including Texas and Ohio.\nIt will be the biggest eclipse in the U.S. since 1806 and there will not be another similar event until 2044.\nZoos \u2014 especially those in or near the totality path of the eclipse \u2014 will also be hosting special events for visitors Monday. That includes ones in Indianapolis, Toledo, Ohio, St. Louis and throughout Texas.\nThe eclipse comes after a 4.8 magnitude earthquake hit Friday in New Jersey near New York City. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For the Washington College Campus Garden Club that's not just a seasonal thing.They, and residents interested in sustainable living practices, gathered together for a monthly potluck dinner April 12 \u2014 a Permaculture Potluck, this time held at the community garden on campus.\nPresident of the club, Jo Perkins described permaculture as a, \"smash of two words, permanent and agriculture.\"\nShe explained, \"It's essentially a set of 12 design principles and three fundamental ethics: earth share, people care and fair share. It's a way to design your systems to be good for humans and for the environment simultaneously.\"\nFor member, Justinian Dispenza, permaculture is a way to get back to our growing roots.\n\"Let's get our feet in the dirt. Eat local and help heal. Everyone is capable of fixing where they're at.\"\nThe space itself is a good indicator of this lifestyle in practice.\nSince its early roots in 2012, when students put in some vegetable beds and trees, the club has grown significantly. The space now has a fenced area with a coop of happy chickens, a renovated pond, a bridge over a little waterfall, a mud pizza oven (primitive earth oven), a beehive, an insect hotel (for pollination purposes) some fruit trees, some buckthorn trees, and some compost piles.\nThis all lies beyond the painted wall on campus. A surreal area, especially surrounded by brick dorm buildings and cars chugging by.\nPerkins said, \"It's really impressive how far the space has come.\"\nShe pointed to her first project she started, over the fence where a scarecrow in Perkin's clothes is humorously referred to as 'The Scare-Jo,\" towards the chickens.\nThere are eight chickens in total, among them Black Jersey Giants, a Leghorn, some Easter Eggers, a Rhode Island Red and a Favorolle.\nAs nature teaches lessons, Perkins described permaculture at work inside the coop.\nShe said that chickens eat bugs which have nutrients, then chicken manure fertilizes the fruit trees, then the chickens eat some of the apples that grow, becoming a catalyst for compost and finally humans eat the nutritious eggs.\nEverything in nature harmonizes.\nShane Brill the permaculture educator at Washington College called it applied common sense.\nHe's been introducing these concepts to his classmates and the've been acting on them, which has produced incredible results.\nThe growing principles and rural way of life is something that Kent County and Eastern Shore residents know about already, so the club hopes to keep good camaraderie with the public.\nBased on the laughter and fellowship it's effective.\nDispenza, who takes the lead in the potlucks, said they always start with people introducing themselves and their field of interest.\nFor example, he said, one could say 'I'm a bee keeper,' and from there, the crowd would learn about another facet of sustainable living.\nAs it stands, the garden has plenty of green space for people to congregate, and they're building a new addition, a section for poetry, for classroom instruction and planning events.\n\"There's a lot of potential for things to come in and do a lot of cool things,\" Perkins commented.\nDispenza and company are always working on more activities for community engagement. They have master gardeners come in, and community events as well as volunteer with the Chestertown Garden Club on various projects.\nBut they are always looking for more people with knowledge on growing, planting, building, producing, harvesting, foraging, or anything else like that.\nDispenza said if anyone is interested in hosting a permaculture potluck, he encouraged them to reach out. He stressed the importance of going to different places in the county to learn, since no two areas are alike.\n\"There's a lot of great people in Kent County and Eastern Shore Community that know about sustainability. I'm here to learn,\" Dispenza said.\nThe next potluck is May 5, at 6 p.m. at Kentmore Park.\nPeople can check out www.facebook.com/espigrow or email espigrow@gmail.com for more details. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I would also like to thank our wonderful Conservation Corps Team and everyone in the Maryland Park Service who helped support our corps members.\"\nMaryland Conservation Corps members come from across the country, are between the ages of 17 and 25, and complete at least 1,700 hours of service.\nThis year's corps class improved more than 2,400 acres of parks and public lands; planted more than 9,963 native trees, bay grasses and plants; treated more than 7,902 trees against harmful insects and diseases; and taught environmental education programs to more than 23,750 students, youth and park visitors.\nThe program offers hands-on, real-world experience in a team-based environment in subjects ranging from aquatic systems to public lands management.\nMany alumni of the program have gone on to conservation careers with organizations including the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the National Aquarium, the United States Geological Survey and others.\nThe Maryland Conservation Corps, an award-winning AmeriCorps program, has been managed by the Maryland Park Service since 1984. The Park Service is now accepting applications for the next class, which begins in the fall.\nMore information and applications for the Maryland Conservation Corps can be found on the DNR website. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Touring through the waters of Kent Narrows, countless boats and watermen were harvesting crabs and oysters in the vicinity.\nKristin Hanna, director of special projects for the Maryland Department of Agriculture, said educational tours such as the chef tour are important in supporting watermen and the local economy.\n\"It helps people tell a story,\" Hanna said. \"So when you're a restaurant, you are competing with so many other restaurants, and everyone really cares about the food they're serving, and this (tour) gives them another story to share about how they're helping the Chesapeake Bay, whether they're serving the blue catfish or crab or oysters. We're supporting a legacy of watermen, which is historical to our state, and that matters.\"\nAfterwards, the group was taken on a tour of the historic Harris Seafood, one of the last remaining packing houses on Ken Narrows and the last full-time shucking house in the state.\nDuring the tour, attendees were shown the quick-paced crab packing process, the oyster preservation process and the various differences between female and male blue crabs.\nZach Jeffries, a sourcing manager for Maryland Food Bank, said the Maryland Food Bank started ordering blue catfish a few years ago through the Local Food Purchase Assistance program, a program that provides funds to purchase food to support local, regional and underserved producers.\n\"It was very educational,\" Jeffries said. \"I've worked \u2026 with the state of Maryland to fight invasive species, but oysters, crab harvesting, it was all very educational \u2026 and extremely fascinating. You learn things you never learned before about the lifespan of oysters and crabs that blows your mind.\"\nToward the end of the event, attendees were treated to a seafood lunch at Harris Crab House, where they feasted on to crab dip, oysters and a variety of different entrees including a crab cake sandwich and a fried oyster sandwich.\nChris Jones, an invasive fish biologist for the Maryland Department of National Resources, said it's important to educate the public about the wildlife in the Chesapeake Bay for the protection of native species.\n\"The Chesapeake is a very unique ecosystem, and these invasive species pose a threat to a lot of our native species,\" Jones said. \"They are out-competing some of our native species \u2026 Invasive fishes in general are posing a threat because they are competing with other species, and they're taking away from species that are important to the bay.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Currently, the lab is working with the city on a flood mitigation project along the Choptank River.\nGetting to community engagement, Sieracki brought up what Horn Point already does to connect with the Cambridge and Dorchester County community. Along with the flood mitigation project, he mentioned the school's weekly Tuesday lab tours, its annual open house in October and the science talks it hosts. He also talked about student internships, K-12 programming and a summer camp the lab hosts called Toadfish Adventures.\nIn looking at where community engagement could expand, Sieracki brought up ideas of supporting local oyster aquaculture and expanding the number of internships and K-12 student programming available. He also mentioned workforce development.\n\"And I want to just challenge you to talk with us about new ideas or directions that we could go that would impact our town,\" he said to the commissioners at the meeting. \"I'm a citizen and resident of the City of Cambridge, so I'm interested in what happens here.\"\nAfter his presentation to the council, Commissioner Shay Lewis-Sisco talked about her experience working with Horn Point as a Dorchester County Public Schools employee. She said the district has a student apprenticing at Horn Point this year and she would love to expand those opportunities.\nCommissioner Brett Summers talked about an idea to promote tourism through oysters in a partnership with a variety of players, like Horn Point, ShoreRivers and the Richardson Maritime Museum.\n\"Perhaps creating some kind of destination where you get to enjoy oysters, learn about what Horn Point's doing and just the history of our area,\" he said.\nSummers said the city could help develop this potential \"oyster trail.\"\n\"And I'm interested,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Tickets are $75 per person.\nLocal humane societies are not directly attached to the National Humane Society, making the Humane Society of Charles County 100% reliant on local donations, grants and fundraising, Rayanne Benya, president of the board of directors for the Humane Society of Charles County, said.\nIn 1975, the humane society did not have a building. Instead, people who found an injured animal had to take them home, Anne Gardiner, founder of the Humane Society of Charles County, said. In 1981, the St. Charles County Association of Realtors gave the humane society the land for a shelter and it opened in 1983.\n\"It was tough getting started,\" Gardiner said. \"One time I had [animals] in all three bathrooms and we were wondering what we were going to do.\"\nThe humane society has three sections: the kennel, which houses animals ranging from dogs and cats to guinea pigs, rabbits, lizards, turtles and snakes; the humane education program, which teaches students about animals and environmental science; and the clinic.\n\"Fifty years later, we're still here,\" Benya said. \"We're here because we're supported by the residents of the county \u2026 and I think that's something to celebrate.\"\nThe gala will have a silent auction with dog baskets, Gardiner said. Other baskets will have household items. Wine and alcohol will be raffled, and there will also be gift cards for restaurants and businesses.\nLive music will be performed by the \"Original\" Moonlighters and there will be a lipsologist \u2014 a person who \"reads\" lip prints \u2014 and a cash bar. Food is being donated by the Waldorf Jaycees.\n\"It's just for a great cause,\" Benya said. \"We adopt out anywhere from one to 2,000 animals a year and all those animals need medical care.\"\nUnder the shelter's care, the humane society often has about 150 animals, an amount that can go up to 250 animals during the summer, Benya said.\nThroughout the year, the shelter has around 200 volunteers who help with adoption events, laundry and being around the animals. They also want to build an animal medical facility for emergencies and a larger surgery wing.\n\"When [people] come here and they volunteer, they see the connection \u2026 between humans and animals,\" Benya said.\nThe humane society is holding its annual photo contest until Sept. 27, Benya said. People can send a cute photo of their pet that can be featured in a calendar.\nOn Sept. 20, they will have an adoption event at the humane society, Benya said.\nThe nonprofit also has a program called Freedom Friends year round that offers discounts to veterans to adopt animals for animals that have been in the shelter for six months or longer.\n\"It's important that we receive the funding \u2026 so we can continue to be here for the county,\" Benya said. \"If we disappear, that's going to be devastating for the animal population.\nFor more information about the Oct. 10 gala or to purchase tickets, go to humanesocietycc.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "One seedling at a time: Nonprofit gives away native plants, empowers youth\n\n October 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ilana Williams iwilliams@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 544\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Esther Bonney turned her grief into growth by starting a nonprofit that aims to spread native plants.Nurture Natives, a youth-led nonprofit organization, empowers young people through native biodiversity, restoration and education.\nAbout a year and a half after losing her older brother to suicide, Bonney, a La Plata resident and founder of Nurture Natives, joined 4-H with the Charles County Pollinator Masters Club to study and dive into being outside with pollinators and native plants.\n\"I felt pretty lost,\" Bonney said. \"Then 4-H came into my life \u2026 and I joined it not knowing that it would be such a beam of support.\"\nAfter attending the National 4-H Youth Summit on Agriscience, members were encouraged to design a project that would solve an agricultural issue, Bonney said. One of the issues that came up during conversations with farmers in Southern Maryland was invasive plant species.\nNurture Natives was created to address this agricultural issue and the broader environmental issue of invasive species.\nThese sustainable efforts helped the National 4-H Council select her as one of the 2026 4-H Youth in Action Award winners. Nurture Natives has planted 2.4 million native seeds, distributed 70,000 seedlings and engaged more than 10,000 young people to help protect native plants and pollinators, according to a release from 4-H.\n\"Pollination is what keeps our world functioning,\" Bonney said. \"Pollination is so key to both our agriculture and our environmental systems.\"\nJeremy Tidd, owner and founder of Bona Terra, looked for ways to give back to the community and get more engagement about his native plant nursery when he decided to start giving seedlings away for free as part of a grant application, he said. Bona Terra grows 30 native plant species and is working to give away one million seedlings a year.\n\"There's no shortage of seeds in the world,\" Tidd said.\nBona Terra became involved with Nurture Native's mission when Bonney called local nurseries to put pamphlets on display racks, Tidd said. Bona Terra invited Nurture Natives to the nursery.\n\"They saw that I was giving away seedlings and they wanted to volunteer,\" Tidd said.\nBona Terra and Nurture Natives partnered to decide how to run seedling giveaway events and what training sessions to offer, Tidd said. They had their first training in March.\n\"Every time the world changes it's because we've taught the next generation,\" Tidd said. \"Young adults \u2026 were taught \u2026 that we had to do something about it and now it's just accepted, common knowledge.\"\nNurture Natives is at the intersection of environmental stewardship and youth mental health, Bonney said. The organization is meant to help young people find meaning through environmental action who feel disconnected from nature or who feel powerless when hearing about the biodiversity crises.\n\"You might notice a lot of people who have a passion for gardening are older,\" Bonney said. \"A discussion that has been pretty consistent \u2026 has been how do we bridge this gap?\"\nBonney is a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park and hopes to continue to grow Nurture Natives as a fellow with the university's Do Good Institute, where she will work on expanding the nonprofit's initiatives, she said.\n\"The coolest thing about the seedlings is it has made people brave,\" Tidd said. \"This is a learning opportunity. Plants are amazing and have so much to teach us.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

My family and I live on a farm, and my son loves to spend a lot of time with our pigs, cows and goats. He loves taking care of them every day because they are his pride and joy. As a result of this, he and his clothes often end up having a distinct scent on them from the animals. He tries to get it off of him, but it sticks.I am offended and upset that someone wouldn't have the guts to tell me to my face. Instead, they chose to leave a note without signing their name. I now feel as if I can't trust the people around me anymore, and I feel as if it could've been anyone from my life.How am I supposed to find out who did this and confront them? - My Son's Hygiene DEAR MY SON's HYGIENE: I'm sorry, but I think you are looking at this through the wrong lens. It isn't that the person lacks courage. I believe the message was delivered anonymously so that you can seriously address this situation rather than get in a rage over the messenger.Stop trying to figure out who wrote it. Start getting creative on helping your teen son learn how to take better care of his body and clothing as he continues to love his animals. Ask some of your male farmer friends what they recommend for cleanliness. This is not a new problem for farmers. Somebody should have solutions you can try.Forgive the messenger, and receive the message.Harriette Cole is a life stylist and founder of DREAMLEAPERS, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

Along the way they discover that being active together is a secret weapon for overcoming the summer blues.SNAP-Ed delivers multi-faceted interventions that support adoption of healthy behaviors by low-income audiences.\"Physical activity has emerged as a priority for SNAP-Ed, both nationally and in Maryland,\" Maryland SNAP-Ed Director Lisa Lachenmayr said in a news release. \"Among the many lasting effects of the pandemic, sedentary behaviors increased due to increased reliance on technology for school and education. While SNAP-Ed's interest in physical activity is as a tool for obesity and chronic disease prevention, our partners also recognize the power of movement to address critical concerns around social-emotional health.\" Physical activity is a current focus area for SNAP-Ed, due to well-documented impacts on chronic disease prevention. Supporting youth in developing a lifelong relationship with physical activity also benefits overall well-being.Books are being distributed to partnering schools, early childhood sites, out of school programs, Maryland WIC offices, SNAP Outreach community partners, low-income 4-H youth programs, and summer meals sites, allowing SNAP-Ed to deliver health promotion messages while supporting family literacy and summer learning.For more information or to read the book, go to https://extension.umd.edu/active-fun. \n \n Caption: Maryland SNAP-Ed has written a new original storybook promoting family physical activity and will donate 125,000 copies across the state. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS-Nine middle school students gained lifesaving skills Wednesday afternoon, thanks to a partnership between the St. Michaels Community Center, St. Michaels Youth & Law Enforcement (SMYLE), Talbot County Emergency Services and the Perkins Family YMCA.Talbot County paramedic Rachael Cox led the afterschool CPR and AED training class at the Y, guiding the young students through the steps to take in an emergency.The class was free for all who participated, thanks to a $200 donation from SMYLE, the St. Michaels Police Department's youth program, that covered certification costs for the students. The St. Michaels Community Center assisted in facilitating the program.Cox began her class by showing how to check if a person is responsive, then asked the students what they thought the next step was.The answer? Calling 911 and staying on the line with the dispatcher.The next step, as Cox demonstrated, is checking if the person is breathing. If not, it's time to start chest compressions, she said.Each student practiced chest compressions on practice manikins and learned how to use an AED before moving on to learning how to do CPR on infants.As a community risk reduction paramedic and CPR and AED coordinator for Talbot County, Cox loves teaching. She likes being able to introduce preteens and teenagers to CPR, first aid and AED skills to prepare them for any emergency situation, even if they're alone without adults present.\"I feel like we call EMS, police, fire and dispatch first responders, but I really don't believe we're first responders because we're not there when the emergency happens-the community is,\" she said. \"And that's why I feel these types of classes are so important.\"Amethyst Monroe, a Perkins Family YMCA staffer who supervised Wednesday's class, is continuing to coordinate other developing middle school programs. She's planning another CPR and AED session soon.Monroe's aim is to make sure future programs are lowcost and provide the area's youth with more life skills.Anyone who wishes to support future after-school programming at the Perkins Family YMCA can donate to the center's annual campaign or reach out to Tracy Eutsler, the Y's executive director, at teutsler@ymcachesapeake.org.Those who are interested in scheduling CPR and AED classes can contact Rachael Cox at rcox@talbotdes.org. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTalbot County paramedic Rachael Cox demonstrates how to use AED chest pads on a practice manikin.\n \nNATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTwo young girls team up to save the life of their practice manikin.

It seems like everything comes so easily to her, and it's hard for me not to compare our paths.Recently, my friend received a $10,000 scholarship for a study abroad program in Japan and landed an internship at one of the top investment banking firms in the United States. She applied to only one internship and only one scholarship, and things fell into place effortlessly. It's as if a fairy comes in every night while she's sleeping and throws magic pixie dust at her to make everything work out. Meanwhile, I feel like I have to fight tooth and nail just to make half as much progress. Every day is a continuous struggle to accomplish the goals that I have. I try hard to be positive, but obstacles pop up constantly. How can I deal with these feelings of envy and move forward with a more upbeat outlook on life? - Jealous DEAR JEALOUS: It is understandable that you would be envious of your friend for what appears to be an easy life. As you also know, it is toxic to dwell on what other people have. No good will come out of that longing. Instead, you must focus on yourself. Do your best to view your life as your perfect challenge. You are gaining resilience as you live through each experience.Claim your small victories.To keep on track, create a vision board. Look through magazines and newspapers for images that reflect the things you want for your life. Cut them out. Brainstorm words and ideas that represent your dreams.Write them down. Next, on a large piece of cardboard or paper, place the images and words together. Make a simple art piece out of this collection of ideas to create your vision board. When thoughts creep in about your friend's success - or anyone else's - wish them well and pivot back to planning your own life. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But pills and IUDs do not allow the prevention of STDs that can lead to long-term health consequences.\n\"Research in 2020 shows only 9% of sexually active high school students used a condom,\" Minetta said. \"That has only increased.\"\nMinetta shared various ways local school systems are providing a condom availability program to meet the needs of their high school students, including those in Queen Anne's, Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot and Wicomico counties, and counties on the western shore.\nWhile some have availability through the school's nurse's office, others provide a \"brown bag\" approach, where students can pick up a paper bag on an anonymous basis.\nBoard member Aretha Dorsey said that as a parent she was concerned that a program like that would encourage secrets among parents and their children.\n\"I feel like parents' rights are being taken away,\" Dorsey said. \"I believe that kids might form a lack of respect for their parents and think they can do things their own way.\"\nBoard member Francois Sullivan said Kent County and its rural location is a valid argument for such a program.\n\"There is a difference between a nurse providing condoms and a cashier.\"\nWhen asked to share her opinion, student board member Madison Messick said she couldn't even remember her sex education class.\n\"I think this is really important,\" she said. \"There is a stigma. We can't go to Walgreens because we know the cashier. I know kids that would definitely benefit from this.\"\nVienna Walker, supervisor of student services for the Board, said she recommended the board adopt a policy where Kent County students can meet with a high school nurse and ask for information and guidance.\nSuperintendent Karen Couch said she had been asked by parents how students could be opted out of a program if they don't approve. Walker said she would need to check with the state's Department of Education to see how that could be handled.\n\"Some students have much more open communication with school nurses than their parents,\" Walker said. \"Their office is much less threatening to students who then become comfortable enough to come back if they are not feeling great.\"\nThat is Walker's goal. She recommended the board consider approving a program that requires students to visit nurses who can provide education and guidance on condom use.\n\"Nurses also encourage students to be open and honest with their parents,\" Walker said.\nMessick agreed.\n\"Students will participate not because kids don't trust their parents,\" she said. \"The program encourages conversations between parents and their children. It's like therapy where they can't tell parents what their child is talking about. This actually helps to form a better relationship between students and parents.\"\nSchool Board President Joe Goetz said he would like for Walker to get information from other districts on how they manage parent objections.\n\"I think real life examples would help,\" Goetz said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gladwin from the University System of Maryland spoke about a new program that would bring medical students to the Eastern Shore, and Sara Rich talked about the growth of the Choptank Community Health System.\nGladwin, who is dean of the University of Maryland School of Medicine and vice president for medical affairs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, talked about the Rural Health Equity and Access Longitudinal elective program.\nOnce in place, he said the program will have students spend their first two years in Baltimore, coming to the Eastern Shore to do rotations. For students' last two years, they will spend four months of each year learning and training on the Eastern Shore.\nThis program will address a need for more health care on the Shore, Gladwin said. The five counties in the state with the fewest primary care physicians per capita are all on the Eastern Shore.\n\"As we all know, there is a pressing need to enhance physician and medical provider services and hospital services for the Eastern Shore,\" he said.\nThis new program is a partnership between the University of Maryland, Baltimore, the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. Between the three partners, Gladwin said $300,000 has been invested to start the program.\nHe said a director, assistant director and administrative support staff have been hired. The estimated cost to support and build the program is about $2.2 million per year, Gladwin said.\n\"We put in a federal grant for the program,\" he said. \"And we think it would be very helpful to get state support for this.\"\nGladwin said they are mainly seeking scholarship support for the program. He said they would like to be able to give out full scholarships to students in the program who agree to staying on the Eastern Shore to work.\n\"We think there's a lot of interest (from) our students in rural health care, in health equity,\" Gladwin said. \"And we think this could be a signature program to attract future doctors.\"\nEastern Shore Delegation Chair Del. Chris Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said he was appreciative of the efforts to get this program going.\n\"It is surely needed,\" he said of the program.\nAlso during the meeting on Friday, Choptank Community Health System CEO Sarah Rich talked about Choptank Community Health's expansions on the Shore.\nCurrently, the health system has seven health centers and 18 school-based health centers across Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties.\nRich said progress on the construction of its new center in Federalsburg is moving along \"very well.\" The health system broke ground on this project in the early summer of 2023.\nThis new center will have five wings for medical, dental and behavioral health services. It will house a rural residency program in partnership with the University of Maryland School of Medicine and University of Maryland Shore Regional Health, as well as a dental residency program.\nRich also talked about Choptank Community Health's expansion into Kent County, which includes a health center in Chestertown and a school-based health center in Rock Hall.\nBehavioral health in schools is another way the health system has expanded.\n\"We know that is a huge need,\" she said. \"So we do have therapists now in Caroline and Talbot counties.\"\nRich said they plan to offer these services to students in Kent County and Queen Anne's County schools next. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Opioid deaths spur push for kids to carry naloxone\n\n March 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SAPNA BANSIL Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1188\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Jackson Taylor remembers when a peer passed out from an overdose across from his high school. He knows friends who have struggled with addiction. One has been in and out of rehab.Those experiences help explain why the Rockville High School senior now trains his peers on how to administer naloxone, a lifesaving medication that reverses opioid overdoses. They're why he carries naloxone at school and why he wants all districts to let their students do the same.\n\"It's just like a student having a heart attack,\" said Taylor, who runs a student task force on drug and opioid issues in Montgomery County. \"It might be rare, but on the off chance it happens, you want to be able to save them and help them.\"\nCurrently, a disparate and ambiguous set of district-level policies has created confusion on the role students may play in preventing opioid deaths among their peers. But a bill before the Maryland General Assembly aims to provide a clear and uniform set of standards.\nThe measure, HB 1268, would explicitly authorize students across the state to possess and administer naloxone \u2014 also known by its brand name, Narcan \u2014 as adolescent opioid deaths surge and teens lobby for urgent solutions.\nWhile the practice is already permitted for students in Montgomery County, others have gotten punished for carrying naloxone in school, according to the bill's sponsor, Del. Joe Vogel (D-Montgomery).\n\"We know that our student populations are uniquely vulnerable when it comes to (the opioid) issue,\" Vogel said. \"And this (bill) is, to me, a common-sense step to say, 'Hey, you should not be punished for carrying naloxone with you in a school hallway, and you should not be punished for saving a classmate's life if they're overdosing.'\"\nAt a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, Taylor, 18, was among those who testified in support of the measure. So, too, did Maryland's Special Secretary of Opioid Response, Emily Keller, an indication that the bill has the backing of Gov. Wes Moore's administration.\n\"Empowering people and giving them the tools necessary to help is a vital strategy, especially with young people,\" Keller said in her testimony. \"Making naloxone accessible with every Marylander is one of our priorities because we know it's the number one life-saving tool.\"\nThe bill responds to an alarming national trend: Between 2018 and 2022, adolescent deaths from opioids quadrupled, according to an analysis by KFF.\nThe rise in overdoses has coincided with two factors, said Patricia Kapunan, the medical director for Montgomery County Public Schools. One is the use of social media to market pills without a prescription. The other is the rise of fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid that is being mixed with illegal drugs, often unbeknownst to the user and with deadly effects.\nIn 2021, fentanyl was involved in nearly four times as many fatal overdoses among young people in Maryland as the next deadliest drug, cocaine, according to the state's Vital Statistics Administration.\n\"Suddenly, (fentanyl) is showing up everywhere, and suddenly one pill can kill,\" Kapunan said.\nImplementation questionsIn response to the opioid crisis, lawmakers have mandated that school districts take preventive actions. The Start Talking Maryland Act of 2017 required public schools to teach kids about the dangers of opioids and have naloxone available on campuses. It also authorized nurses and other health and school personnel to administer the medication in overdose emergencies.\nMost districts have not extended the same permission to students. In Cecil County, students are not necessarily punished for possessing naloxone, according to director of student and school safety John Roush. But \"they would be talked to by their school administration about it and informed that we don't have a policy for (them) to carry that in schools,\" he said.\nRoush thinks the bill is a good idea and may help save lives, though he anticipates challenges with implementation and logistics.\n\"We have over 15,000 kids in our system here,\" he said. \"How do you get Narcan out? How do you get information out? How do you make them educated on the use? How do you make them aware? It seems like there would be a lot of time and details to be worked out in that regard.\"\nWhile the bill requires schools to educate students about the benefits of naloxone, it does not specifically address one major logistical consideration: training kids on how to dispense the medication.\nAvailable over the counter as a nasal spray, Narcan must be administered by tilting the person's head back and firmly pressing the plunger. Because the medication's effects are temporary and overdose symptoms may return, it is critical that the individual providing Narcan also call 911 and seek medical aid.\nTo the American Medical Association, the benefits of expanding naloxone access in schools still outweigh the risks. Following a debate on the issue, the group approved a resolution last year encouraging \"states, communities and educational settings to remove barriers to students carrying safe and effective overdose reversal medications.\"\n\"Narcan saves people quickly, and lack of Narcan kills people quickly,\" said Kenneth Certa, an AMA delegate from the American Psychiatric Association, which co-sponsored the policy. \"When somebody is turning blue and cold, you don't have much time. And to wait until a dose gets from another part of the building can be too late.\"\n'Hugely empowering'In Montgomery County, which saw a 78% spike in youth overdoses from 2021 to 2022, a policy permitting students to carry naloxone took effect on May 1, 2023.\nKapunan, who crafted the measure, said students were never punished for possessing overdose-reversing medications and were already protected under good samaritan laws if they acted in an emergency. But teen advocates nonetheless pressed for a policy change that eliminated ambiguity and codified their right to intervene.\n\"Those levels of permission were really important to students,\" Kapunan said. \"For me, it was a very small part of the regulation. For them, it was hugely empowering.\"\nKapunan says the policy does not mean schools are depending on kids to save lives. During the 2022-23 school year, naloxone was dispensed on school grounds in Montgomery County 18 times, almost always by nurses. Since the policy change, there have been no known instances of a student administering naloxone to a peer at school.\nBut to supporters, the measure remains an important preventive step, permitting those in closest proximity to an overdose to act without fear of repercussion.\n\"Students know before the teachers do, is the truth,\" Taylor said. \"I'm a lot more likely to know, 'Hey, my friend has a pill in his bag that he's thinking about taking, and it could have a repercussion' than a teacher would know.\"\nVogel, who is running for the open U.S. congressional seat in Maryland's 6th District, said expanding policies like the one in Montgomery County has become a necessity. Six months ago, he met with student leaders who spoke to the urgency of the opioid crisis and their desire to help address it.\n\"A lot of them have taken matters into their own hands,\" Vogel said. \"A number of them have stepped up and said, 'We want to get trained on how to administer naloxone, and we want to be able to carry naloxone.' \u2026 That's what this bill is in response to.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "For All Seasons is growing with the Latino community\n\n May 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 802\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 For All Seasons, a behavioral health and rape crisis center serving the Eastern Shore, has had what could be described as a long and continuously adapting relationship with serving the local Latino community.Ivy Garcia, director of Latino services at For All Seasons, said it began in 2006 when she was hired as an interpreter for the nonprofit. Garcia said though the work she was doing at the time was important, the more she talked to the local community, the more she realized that this was just a stepping stone.\nShe moved on to become an advocate, and when word got out that a Latina was advocating for the Latino community, more and more Latino clients began to seek resources.\nGarcia's passion shone through her work as she began to advocate for more and more services, including a Spanish language crisis hotline, staff training, educational groups, and the Latino Program at For All Seasons.\n\"The people started to trust and confide themselves to me,\" Garcia said. \"I started doing education workshops on self-esteem and women empowerment. I also bring in guest speakers like Planned Parenthood and the Department of Health, and we eat food together and discuss topics they may have questions about.\"\nToday, For All Seasons has established a Latino Program to help serve the many needs of the local Latino community. This program provides bilingual education and outreach initiatives for communities throughout the Mid-Shore region.\nThe services provided range from support groups, case management, advocacy and referrals to local resources. Garcia leads a support group for Latinas on Mondays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., where she listens to the needs of women and finds ways to assist their ever-changing needs.\nBeth Anne Dorman, president and CEO of For All Seasons, said it's important for people to understand that the Hispanic community in Talbot County is growing. Currently, 15% of the clients For All Seasons serves are Spanish-speaking, and Dorman said they are preparing for those numbers to continue to climb.\nEducation has been the staple of expanding mental health services for the Latino community. Garcia said that mental health is seen as taboo to many Latinos and carries a stigma of being associated with \"crazy.\" For Garcia, it's essential to explain to clients that mental health should be taken as seriously as physical health.\nHowever, education does not stop with clients. Garcia and Dorman have made a point of educating both community members and staff on culturally relevant information in order to better serve the Latino population.\nThe entire agency team receives cultural education so that when Spanish-speaking community members come in, all staff can better understand ways to assist and accommodate expected needs.\nAlongside the education the staff receives, Dorman said For All Seasons has also created a safe environment where staff can ask questions if they have questions pertaining to cultural differences that may arise.\nGarcia said that because many of their Latino clients are undereducated about health, especially mental health, it's important for staff to put in extra work to help assist them and meet them where they are. However, what she keeps at the forefront of her work is admiration for her clients.\nMany of her clients are migrants who have left behind friends, parents and children to come to the United States to work to send money back to their loved ones. Still, when they journey to the United States, they will often go through intense trauma and may not know the tools to navigate their new reality.\n\"It's important to sit down with clients and tell them that though I may not be in your shoes, I see you and admire you for doing that,\" Garcia said.\n\"Because to leave your family is not easy, but you are doing it for love and because you didn't have another option,\" Garcia said. \"It's a passion that I have for this community that I don't think I will ever lose in my lifetime.\"\nDorman said one of the moments that made her feel that the Latino Program was working was two years ago when they hosted a backpack giveaway in the nonprofit's parking lot.\n\"I'm not joking with you. They were lined up down the street, and we were their safe place to land,\" Dorman said. \"When you think about the trauma that these families have experienced, you think about being in a space where they know nothing, they know no one, and they are coming here for them to show up in the parking lot of For All Seasons during the backpack giveaway, and be able to know that there's a place for them to be served.\n\"And that they're a part of our community and they are a part of something. To me, that's the moment that I think just really sort of says it all about who we have become for the Latino community and Talbot County.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "The gift of sight: Nonprofit has provided 15,000 free pairs of eyeglasses to Delaware students\n\n May 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 546\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Approximately 30 Keene Elementary School students received the gift of sight Thursday when a nonprofit stopped by to deliver free eyeglasses.The excited kids received their new glasses during a brief ceremony in the school library.\n\"It's amazing to see one of our kiddos put on glasses for the first time and seeing their face light up when they can see,\" Principal Mariellen Taraboletti said. \"It's very heartwarming.\"\nThe glasses were courtesy of Vision to Learn, a nonprofit that has been serving Delaware schools since 2014. It started in California and now operates in 15 states.\nSchool nurses perform an initial vision screening on students and, on average, approximately one-third are referred for an eye exam by an optometrist.\nVision to Learn comes to the school and performs eye exams in a specially outfitted van. Kids who need glasses get to pick out their frames, and the nonprofit returns to deliver the glasses about a month later.\nOver the past decade, Vision to Learn has performed 20,000 eye exams in Delaware and provided 15,000 pairs of glasses \u2013 all free of charge. The effort is funded by donations, as well as billing Medicaid.\nAt Keene, County Executive Matt Meyer presented Vision to Learn with $100,000 from the county's share of the American Rescue Plan Act, enough to provide glasses to nearly 700 more kids.\nAnn Hollister, CEO of Vision to Learn, said it never gets old seeing kids receive their glasses.\n\"It's a little aha moment. So often kids tell us they didn't know the world looked like this,\" Hollister said. \"It's a special moment when they realize, 'Oh, I can see better.'\"\nOften, she added, parents don't realize their kids are struggling with their eyesight.\n\"If a child has a tummy ache, they might go home and tell a parent. But they don't know they can't see,\" Hollister said. \"At a young age, they just think that's what the world looks like.\"\nWhile school nurses have done vision screening for years, having Vision to Learn come to the school to do eye exams and fit kids for glasses is a huge convenience for parents, Taraboletti said.\n\"It's not even just the free glasses,\" she said. \"You don't have to take off work to go to the eye doctor, you don't have to then go back and pick up the glasses. People are busy, and it just makes it so much easier.\"\nBeing able to see properly helps kids do better in school, Hollister said.\n\"Studies show that it makes a profound difference in academic outcomes,\" she said. \"It's one of the most impactful interventions you can provide a child. Everything else works better if you can see.\"\nChristina School District Superintendent Dan Shelton concurred.\n\"A lot of times when we talk about accessibility, we talk about accessibility by access to programs and access to services and access to courses,\" Shelton said. \"But none of that stuff is very helpful if you can't see it.\"\nKeene fourth-grader David Pierre has worn glasses for a few years but was happy to receive a new pair with an updated prescription.\n\"All my other ones have scratches,\" Pierre said.\nAiden Onfroy, also a fourth-grader, was happy to have a new pair of glasses.\n\"The first pair of glasses I got, I still wore them but every couple seconds, I kept on squinting,\" Onfroy said. \"I can see way better.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Escape the Vape Youth Summit held at Chesapeake College\n\n May 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ERIC SYLVIA Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Life \n \n 672\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS \u2014 On a rainy Saturday, approximately 35 students from area schools gathered at Chesapeake College for an event called Escape the Vape, a youth summit.The kids ranged in age from sixth grade to high school and chose to participate in an event designed to empower youth to embrace a vape-free and smoke-free lifestyle. Those attending came from Dorchester, Kent, Talbot and Queen Anne's counties.\nThe program was spearheaded by Dorine Fasset of Queen Anne's County Department of Health, Prevention Services and her colleague Anna Ashley. In addition to the Department of Health, this event had support from Citizens Against Smoking Tobacco Coalition and Chesapeake College Office of Student Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.\nThe program is made available through a grant from Kent County Health Department and Maryland Department of Health.\nAccording to the latest available data from the 2021-2022 school year, over one in four high school students within the five-county Mid-Shore region are current tobacco users. This epidemic is largely driven by the use of electronic smoking devices, e-cigs, or vapes, which have been heavily marketed to teens.\nThe summit featured rap and dance performances aimed at promoting a passion for healthy choices and encouraging young people to reject harmful habits. Special guest Sterlen Barr, CEO of Rapping About Prevention, hoped to inspire attendees with his message of positivity and resilience.\nDr. LaMarr Shields of Baltimore's Cambio Group led the morning session with his son Mosiah by his side. An inspirational speaker, educator, thought-leader, author and artist, Shields creates with purpose in all aspects of his professional and personal life using the common thread of Ubuntu philosophy: a person is a person through other people.\nAn Open Society Institute Fellow and a former faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Education, Shields is co-founder and senior director of education and innovation at the Cambio Group. Shields dedicates his life to inspiring adults and youth alike to pursue a higher purpose, achieve sustainable value for long-term success, and cope with adversity in order to create opportunities in their personal, professional and spiritual lives.\nFurther inspiration was provided through the music and dance of Barr, aka NoPuffDaddy, delivering a high-energy performance using facts, humor, personal experience, teamwork exercises and audience participation. Rapping About Prevention teaches the importance of maintaining a positive, drug-free, safe, healthy and active lifestyle all while having an amazing and memorable experience.\nBarr's own journey began in Philly over 30 years ago when he lost his grandmother to lung cancer. He began writing and rapping as a way to work through his grief, and hopes to help prevent other families from feeling the same pain. A lifetime athlete and former boxer, Barr's presentation style is high energy on purpose \u2014 and it too draws the students to the message.\nPresented to students in middle and high schools across the country, he reaches thousands each year with his work. He says, \" Kids don't care about how much you know until they know how much you care.\"\nShields shared, \"We are addicted almost at birth to sugar and salt \u2014 it's one of the reasons kids say they vape \u2014 because it tastes good.\" Shields has spent a lifetime understanding the reasons people and especially our kids get hooked on these substances so easily. These summits are one of the ways he says we can combat it \u2014 through understanding and providing a message that reaches the kids. Watching the response as he walked his audience through his presentation made it clear the message was hitting the mark.\nHigh school student Wyatt Tolker attending the session with his mom Kerieanne Hinerman, Dorchester County's Tobacco Program Coordinator, was inspired to write verse in response to one of the exercises.\nSpeaking after the session with Tolker, he relayed the thought process behind his inspiration, \"I've always written stuff \u2014 I have a notebook full of things I've written. When Dr. Shields asked us to write down our responses, I knew I wanted to present a message that would appeal and speak to the other kids in the room, regardless of their age.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Learning things never has to be boring,\" 10th grade ambassador Samuel Mora of Queen Anne's County High said.\nAfter completing the escape room, groups were invited to have a snack and share their experiences.\nThe QAC Drug Free student ambassadors had utilized the escape room idea to enter a national competition with Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Kille said. The goal of the competition was to enter an idea of how to share the dangers of pills with their peers, she said.\nThe students' escape room was selected as one of the top six winners of the competition's 200 entries, earning them $5,000, she said.\nOfficials with Save the Day Escape Rooms lent expertise and mentorship to help the ambassadors craft the perfect puzzle space, Kille said.\nA collaborative effort with the whole community, the ambassadors partnered with local businesses and drug-free organizations to offer the event including: the QAC Drug Free Coalition, Opioid Operational Command Center, Chesapeake YMCA, Save the Day Escape Rooms and the Mattress Store in Annapolis and Chester.\nInformation about QAC Goes Purple is available at qacgoespurple.org/home. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Shortly after, he founded the nonprofit to educate people about the disease.\nSince 2000, he has been devoted full time to the foundation. Prior to the pandemic, over 1,700 schools were using the lessons. As a member of the Rotary Club of Peabody, Massachusetts, in 2022, Fine expanded outreach to U.S. and Canadian Rotary Clubs in the Eastern and Atlantic time zones.\nHe uses the technology of virtual lessons to reach those who he would not otherwise be able to meet.\nFine received his doctorate in chemistry from Northeastern University, continuing his postdoctoral research at Lehigh University.

It's a leading cause of longterm disability that affects 80% families.\nPrice further read that professionals like Sukhdeo-Singh's team, are reaching out to the public and private schools here to spread that awareness as well as to Emergency services and the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Chestertown.\nSukhdeo-Singh showed the commissioners some materials of their organization as well as how to spot stroke symptoms in an easy-to-remember acronym:\nB-E-F-A-S-T\n\"B\" stands for balance. Often the first sign of a stroke, followed by \"E\" for eyes, distorting of vision. Then \"F\" for facial abnormalities, like freezing or tics. Then there could be tingling or numbness in the arms or legs, which is \"A\". \"S\" stands for \"speech,\" which if muddled, confused or slurred, it's then \"T\", Time to call 911.\nThe commissioners could relate, sharing experiences of their loved ones.\nPrice shared his father suffered a stroke at age 65, and although he lived to be 86, he said his recovery was never fully complete.\nCommission member Albert Nickerson recalled an incident when his niece insisted somebody check on her grandmother when she didn't show up for her soccer game. Her insistence and instincts were good. When someone checked on her, they discovered her grandmother was in the beginning stages of a stroke.\nCounty Attorney Tom Yeager shared also that his father suffered a stroke, but he was unsure of what it was at the time. He didn't seek help for it until a week later.\n\"That's why awareness is so important,\" Yeager said.\nSukhdeo-Singh called it, \"Spot a Stroke, Stop a Stroke, and Save a Life\".\nAnd using advanced procedures such as improved imaging technology, they can spot where the source of the stroke happens, the clot in the brain, and prescribe clot-busting medication before it's too late.\nOr surgery if needed.\n\"We work closely to reverse strokes or do surgical procedures to remove the clot from the brain,\" Sukhdeo-Singh said.\nLeonard thanked the commissioners for making July 27, Kent County Stroke Smart.\n\"This will help with the partnership with the County to get education and support our partnerships.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's a leading cause of longterm disability that affects 80% families.Price further read that professionals like Sukhdeo-Singh's team, are reaching out to the public and private schools here to spread that awareness as well as to Emergency services and the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Chestertown.\nSukhdeo-Singh showed the commissioners some materials of their organization as well as how to spot stroke symptoms in an easy-to-remember acronym:\nB-E-F-A-S-T\n\"B\" stands for balance. Often the first sign of a stroke, followed by \"E\" for eyes, distorting of vision. Then \"F\" for facial abnormalities, like freezing or tics. Then there could be tingling or numbness in the arms or legs, which is \"A\". \"S\" stands for \"speech,\" which if muddled, confused or slurred, it's then \"T\", Time to call 911.\nThe commissioners could relate, sharing experiences of their loved ones.\nPrice shared his father suffered a stroke at age 65, and although he lived to be 86, he said his recovery was never fully complete.\nCommission member Albert Nickerson recalled an incident when his niece insisted somebody check on her grandmother when she didn't show up for her soccer game. Her insistence and instincts were good. When someone checked on her, they discovered her grandmother was in the beginning stages of a stroke.\nCounty Attorney Tom Yeager shared also that his father suffered a stroke, but he was unsure of what it was at the time. He didn't seek help for it until a week later.\n\"That's why awareness is so important,\" Yeager said.\nSukhdeo-Singh called it, \"Spot a Stroke, Stop a Stroke, and Save a Life\".\nAnd using advanced procedures such as improved imaging technology, they can spot where the source of the stroke happens, the clot in the brain, and prescribe clot-busting medication before it's too late.\n\"We work closely to reverse strokes or do surgical procedures to remove the clot from the brain,\" Sukhdeo-Singh said.\nLeonard thanked the commissioners for making July 27, Kent County Stroke Smart.\n\"This will help with the partnership with the County to get education and support our partnerships.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Controlling the connection between the human brain and the brain of the computer has helped researchers in their studies.\nTransmitting information between the two brains has helped expose conscious and unconscious mental activity. Fields explained how cognitive performance can be improved by manipulating brainwaves.\nFields has authored his latest book, \"Electric Brain,\" which discusses the history, current research and future of brainwaves in monitoring and manipulating brain function. As a neuroscientist, he has written over 150 papers on scientific research as well as numerous books and magazine articles.\nA fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, he has received the Mensa Foundation Award for outstanding research in intelligence and creativity. Fields joined the National Institutes of Health in 1987, retiring as chief of the Nervous System Development and Plasticity Section in 2023.\nA resident of Taylor's Island in Dorchester County, Doug has such hobbies as wine making, guitar building and mountain climbing.\nFollowing his talk with the rotarians, he was inducted into the Rotary Club of Cambridge by past President Amanda Hailey with his sponsor, Pat Neild, by his side. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Around 40 people started at the James Wright Memorial Park and either ran or walked the course.Catherine Bowrey is the chair of the Caroline Goes Purple Color Run.\n\"I am glad to see everyone out here having a good time. We have to get aware of the drug epidemic, which is a big thing. The stigma is terrible. So this way they can come out and get aware of what is going on in their communities,\" Bowrey said.\nCaroline Goes Purple is organized by the Denton nonprofit Drug Free Caroline, a substance abuse disorder prevention and awareness program. Caroline Goes Purple is a community effort during the month of September to prevent drug use, heighten awareness and reduce the stigma around substance abuse disorder.\nJessica Tuel is the director of behavioral health for the Caroline County Health Department as well as the local addiction authority for Caroline County. She stood in front of a public health table filled with information, stress balls and pens.\n\"We do a lot of services in the schools both for substance use and mental health. We have full time clinicians in the north county schools and we have the Mobile Treatment Unit,\" Tuel said.\nHer work is data-led.\n\"The statistics say that the earlier people start using, the longer and higher risk their use is later. Today we are bringing awareness to substance abuse in our county. We have a lot of vendors that are going to give education and services for those who need them. It is important to all these peers here, who are in a state of recovery. That is what all of the Caroline Goes Purple events are for,\" she said.\nAs a public health expert she wants both education and anti stigma to get across.\n\"Stigma is multifaceted. So it is stigma of the community against those who use. It is stigma of those that don't want treatment because they fear they will be judged. It is 'We don't have this problem in Caroline County,'\" Tuel said.\nThe remedy to stigma is education and bringing statistics to the community, she said.\nAngel Perez, the former Caroline Goes Purple Chair, was at this year's event as a volunteer.\n\"This event is important because we can raise awareness about substance abuse prevention and what is going on in our communities. We created this event last year to raise awareness in a fun way. Everybody can enjoy, but also get the information. We want to make them aware of what is going on in our community with substance abuse,\" Perez said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Students like Riaz are taking initiative to address these disparities and help close the medical disparity through the Rural Health Equity and Access Longitudinal Elective.\nThe students will be provided didactic and mentoring sessions as well as research and clinical experiences on the Eastern Shore.\nLeah Millstein, the program director and associate professor of medicine, said there's a real challenge for the population of the Eastern Shore in finding and accessing exemplary healthcare.\n\"There's a shortage in primary care doctors as well as specialties, and we often have students who are interested in rural medical care in their futures, but their exposure to it during medical school is limited,\" Millstein said. \"So this program seeks to fill those gaps, to really give the students an in depth exposure to rural health care, and give them the building blocks that allow them to feel like they'll be successful serving as physicians in those communities when they're done with their training.\"\nRiaz said her initial circumstances in Punjab made her realize the importance of one-to-one connection with patients and their medical providers.\n\"I personally faced the challenges of not discussing quality healthcare due (to a) shortage of physicians,\" Riaz said. \"Individuals of my village have to go to far off places to get necessary healthcare.\"\nThe program is designed to train and place incoming medical students in Eastern Shore healthcare practices. About $1.4 million has been secured in state funding and from the University of Maryland, Baltimore; University of Maryland Eastern Shore; the Rural Maryland Council and many donors.\nMillstein said three of the six students accepted into the program were awarded full-tuition scholarships with a commitment to working on the Eastern Shore for four years after completing residency training. The long-term goal is to support 10 students interested in rural health in this elective program each year.\nKen Kozel, president and CEO of University of Maryland Shore Regional Health, said this program will help draw new providers to the Eastern Shore.\n\"Strengthening our provider workforce is a top priority at UM SRH, and programs like R-HEALE will help us attract providers who want to practice in rural communities,\" Kozel said. \"We greatly appreciate our partnership with the School of Medicine toward enhancing access across the Shore.\"\nFor Riaz, she is happy for the opportunity to focus on improving rural areas and assisting caring for the people in rural areas.\n\"With this program, I'll be able to be involved in research projects that are deeply focused on improving population and community health, and also to deeply understand the social, economic or cultural factors that are rooted in the disparities of such communities,\" she said. \"I think this comprehensive training through our field will allow me to deliver more compassionate and patient centered care in the future.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland spent big on youth mental health \u2014 but then the budget crisis hit\n\n February 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SASHA ALLEN Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1370\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Tthe new statewide youth mental health program supported behavioral health services for more than 58,000 students in its first eight months of operations from March through October 2024. Four out of every five of Maryland public schools received aid for mental health services under the state's effort.But as the General Assembly moved to balance Maryland's fiscal 2025 budget last spring, lawmakers cut funding for the state's fledgling youth mental health program from Gov. Wes Moore's recommended $110 million to $40 million.\nWith the state's fiscal problems deepening, Moore is recommending the state allocate $40 million annually through 2030 to a program he once suggested should get $130 million a year starting in fiscal 2026.\nMeagan Pantelis, a clinical social worker at Thrive Behavioral Health, said the proposed cuts would decimate services for students that, in many cases, are just getting off the ground.\n\"Whenever I found out about that proposed cut, the very first thing that came to mind is that Gov. Moore is wanting to balance a budget on the backs of our children,\" Pantelis said. \"I just find that to be just egregious. I mean, why are our children the population that we are targeting? Why are they not the population that we want to build up and support?\"\nMoore, however, has stressed the state must act to close a structural $3 billion budget gap driven in part by the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the 10-year, multibillion-dollar education reform plan that created the youth mental health program.\n\"We only have difficult decisions ahead,\" Moore said in his State of the State address in early February. \"We must close this $3 billion budget gap.\"\nThe mental health crisisDuring the 2022-23 school year, over a quarter of Maryland high school students reported their mental health was not good at most or all times, according to a Maryland Department of Health survey.\nThe percentage was only slightly lower for middle school students, with 22% reporting their mental health was not good at most or all times.\n\"We all know generally that there's a mental health crisis,\" said Lorianne Moss, the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission program manager. \"So as sort of the preamble to our first call for proposals, we laid out some data.\"\nThat data, from the Centers for Disease Control, showed 40% of high school students experience persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Citing such statistics, the consortium urged mental health programs and nonprofits across the state to apply for funds.\nApplicants requested a total of $380 million in grants, said Mark Luckner, executive director of the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission, which oversees the consortium. That's more than three times what the consortium had to allocate.\nNevertheless, the state funded mental health service providers in every county.\nPreventing youth suicide is one of the consortium's key goals, said Dr. John Campo, director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Sixteen of the consortium's 129 grants so far focus on suicide prevention.\nSuicide is the second-leading cause of death for people ages 10-14 and third for people ages 15-24, according to the most recent CDC data.\n\"Suicide kills more young people in that age group than cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, infections of all kinds, meningitis, pneumonia, HIV, COVID \u2014 the whole nine yards,\" Campo said. \"Add them all together, suicide kills more people than all those things combined.\"\nIn Maryland, the teen suicide rate increased by more than a third from 2014 to 2022. Campo said the state's health care system has been ill-equipped to deal with that increase.\n\"Mental health crisis isn't a priority in most emergency departments,\" Campo said.\nCampo is one of the co-chairs of the consortium's best practices subcommittee, a group that developed a list of evidence-based mental health practices for grantees to implement.\nEach program targets a different facet of the mental health crisis. The responses are also tailored to the varying levels of severity of the mental health conditions different age groups experience.\nThe consortium found through surveys targeted at both students and parents that 90% of students and families were satisfied with the services.\n\"A lot of these practices have been tested,\" Campo said. \"If regional organizations adopt them and implement them with fidelity, we really do want to believe that there will be positive outcomes associated with it.\"\nFrom the city to the ShoreThe youth mental health crisis touches all of Maryland, and so does the state's response \u2014 but grants are tailored to the vast differences among Maryland's urban, suburban and rural communities.\nIn Baltimore City, the 11 grants the consortium issued take into account a stigma surrounding mental health services, said Jennifer Cox, director of the University of Maryland School Mental Health Program, which received a $970,000 grant to run a number of programs.\n\"We think in Baltimore City, we have to be a little bit more creative than just saying, 'Come get help,' \" Cox said. \"We know we have good things to offer, we just need to find a good way to offer it.\"\nWorking with trusted community organizations such as churches and youth centers, the program has been able to reach people who would otherwise not seek out mental health treatment, Cox said.\nServices range from in-school counseling from certified clinicians to parent and caregiver education programs.\nMeanwhile, the state's efforts on the largely rural Eastern Shore stress increasing access to treatment in a region that's short of professionals to respond to the youth mental health crisis.\nAccording to the October 2024 report, \"Investing in Maryland's Behavioral Health Talent,\" Maryland is nearly 50% short of the mental health workers it needs.\n\"There's a resounding message of 'we just need more,'\" said Beth Anne Dorman, CEO of For All Seasons, a behavioral health and rape crisis center that received a grant to expand its services in Kent County. \"We need more.\"\nCaroline County, where two organizations won grants to expand their mental health services, faces the same situation, said Derek Simmons, the county's superintendent of schools.\n\"We are a rural county that is less wealthy than a lot of parts of the state,\" said Simmons, co-chair of the consortium's best practices committee. \"So access to behavioral health is near and dear, and a real challenge where I'm at.\"\nAn uncertain future\nIf the General Assembly agrees with the funding levels suggested in the governor's budget, programs that just started last year may have to be eliminated, said Del. Eric Ebersole (D-Baltimore County, Howard).\n\"That group worked in good faith to bring providers online,\" said Ebersole, a consortium member. \"If the government loses them, can you get them back?\"\nDan Martin, senior director of public policy at the Mental Health Association of Maryland, said the proposed cut in planned funding comes at a time when youth mental health care is more important than ever.\n\"At a time when 18% of high school students and 24% of middle school students have seriously considered suicide in the past year, a reduction of this size in school mental health funding could prove disastrous,\" Martin said.\nIf the General Assembly approves Moore's budget proposal, the grants distributed by the program in fiscal years 2025 and 2026 combined will be cut 28% from the total amount distributed the prior two years.\nAsked for comment, Moore's office stressed the governor's proposed allocation for fiscal year 2026 and beyond is exactly what the General Assembly approved for 2025.\n\"Gov. Moore is maintaining the current level of funding for the Maryland Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports,\" wrote a spokesperson from the governor's office. \"The Governor strongly supports behavioral health treatment for Maryland's children, and maintaining current levels of funding during the state's budget crisis reflects that commitment.\"\nThe Mental Health Association of Maryland is urging action to try to persuade the General Assembly to restore funding to a higher level. The organization is circulating a fact sheet with information on the consortium, the work it's done and what a permanent cut in funding would do to students and schools.\n\"Use the above information and write an email to your legislators asking them to restore funding to the Community Supports Partnership Fund,\" the fact sheet said. \"Provide testimony (either written or oral or both) opposing the cut\" at General Assembly hearings.\nAnd under the \"why is funding needed\" section, the Mental Health Association fact sheet reads: \"Dramatic worsening of the behavioral health of children and youth over the last decade.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From crisis to change: COVID-19\u2019s enduring mark on the Eastern Shore\n\n March 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STAFF REPORT | Section: Local News \n \n 642\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic reached the Eastern Shore, its impact lingers in ways both visible and unseen. The empty streets, masked faces, and social distancing markers have faded, but the profound shifts in health care, worship, business and daily life remain.Emma Zonetti never expected the pandemic to reach her tight-knit community.\n\"I remember being in church, actually. My husband's mom told me that this was happening,\" said Zonetti, now a senior clinical nurse with University of Maryland Shore Regional Health. \"And I went, 'Oh, it's nothing to worry about. It's just another virus.' And then quickly did we learn that it was way more than that.\"\nZonetti, who was a clinical coordinator in the telemetry unit at the Shore Medical Center at Easton during the height of the crisis, recalled the stark reality that unfolded as cases surged.\n\"It certainly impacted us far larger than I could ever anticipate,\" she said.\nLate in January 2020, hospitals began screening for the virus as patients arrived in emergency rooms.\nBy March, State Superintendent of Schools Dr. Karen Salmon ordered a closure of schools \u2014 a temporary order that extended well into 2021, much longer than anyone anticipated.\nBeaches and boardwalks closed. And by April, the number of positive cases surged and mask orders ensued.\nCOMMUNITY BLINDSIDEDThe first confirmed case of COVID-19 on the Eastern Shore was reported in Talbot County on March 16, 2020. Since then, there have been 8,056 confirmed cases in the county and more than 40,000 across the Mid-Shore. The virus claimed the lives of 592 Mid-Shore residents.\nFor religious communities, the impact was swift and disruptive. Pastor Doug Morley of Greater Impact Church in Greensboro said the closure of worship spaces came at a critical time for his newly merged congregation.\n\"Building on the momentum of coming together for greater Kingdom impact in 2019 and gearing up for what would potentially be one of our highest attended worship experiences on Easter Sunday (April 12, 2020), we were definitely blindsided by the mandated closure of all religious gatherings,\" Morley said.\nChurch leaders scrambled to adapt, turning to Facebook Live for virtual worship and launching a \"drive-in\" service using a tractor-trailer bed as a stage and an FM transmitter to broadcast services to parked cars.\n\"It forced us to think outside the four walls of the church,\" Morley said. \"That shift in approach has remained with us.\"\nEven after indoor services resumed, Morley noted, worship attendance has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. While some members embraced online services, others simply fell out of the habit.\nLASTING LEGACYWhen Maryland lifted its COVID-19 state of emergency on July 1, 2021, many expected a swift return to normalcy. In some ways, that happened \u2014 travel resumed, restaurants filled and hugs replaced distanced greetings. But the pandemic left lasting imprints on the Eastern Shore.\nTelehealth became commonplace. Remote work grew. Businesses closed, moved or downsized. Schools and universities permanently integrated virtual options. Many delayed retirement. Awareness of mental health surged as loneliness and isolation persisted.\nThe pandemic reshaped our priorities, forcing people to rethink work, education and social connection. Some changes were temporary, but others \u2014 like digital access and hybrid work models \u2014 are likely here to stay.\nWhile it has taken a few years to get back to some semblance of normalcy, the impact of COVID-19 upon regular worship attendance is still evident.\n\"We have not returned to pre-pandemic numbers, and we still have individuals and families who choose to worship online rather than in-person,\" Morely said. \"A few who once attended regularly have gotten out of the habit and find it difficult to return on a consistent basis.\"\nAs the Eastern Shore reflects on the past five years, the region has found resilience in adversity. Communities innovated, businesses adapted and individuals discovered new ways to connect. The pandemic may have left its mark, but so, too, did the spirit of perseverance that defines the Shore. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

While the virus disrupted lives, it also accelerated innovations and exposed critical gaps in infrastructure, healthcare and social support systems.\nThe digital divide, long a silent challenge for rural communities, suddenly became a lifeline during lockdowns. Broadband expansion, once a slow-moving initiative, gained momentum as remote work, telehealth and online education became necessities rather than conveniences.\nMental health emerged as another critical frontier. The isolation, uncertainty and collective trauma of the pandemic laid bare the state of community mental wellness.\nThe federal government's response came in the form of the American Rescue Plan Act, a massive injection of funds designed to support communities struggling in the pandemic's wake. These funds became a lifeline for local governments, schools and healthcare systems, offering a temporary reprieve and an opportunity for strategic reinvestment.\nThe pandemic forced communities to reimagine infrastructure, healthcare delivery, education and social connectivity. Each challenge became an opportunity for innovation, each obstacle a chance to rebuild more resiliently.\nIn this section, we'll explore these lasting impacts \u2014 how broadband expansion bridged critical access gaps, how mental health challenges surfaced and began to be addressed, and how ARPA funds were deployed to support communities during their most vulnerable moment. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

COVID helped bring more awareness to a topic that needed to be more focused on, experts say.\"So I think what COVID did was it brought to light that we all experience mental health symptoms,\" said For All Seasons President and CEO Beth Anne Dorman.\nOn March 13, 2020, the first Trump Administration declared a nationwide emergency. The world stopped for what many thought would only be two weeks. It turned out to be much longer.\nAt schools, some seniors didn't get the chance to walk the stage or have their senior prom, which caused mental health officials in schools to be proactive on making sure students were in good spirits.\n\"In that first early wave, we did not have behavioral health providers working for us at Choptank,\" said Chrissy Bartz, PA-C director of Community Based Programs at Choptank Community Health System.\n\"The therapists that were already working in the schools, they connected with those students at home as soon as they could. Fortunately with COVID came virtual and telehealth opportunities that we had never seen before in care.\"\nStudents experienced many different mental health problems. Some students were forced to be at home every day in situations that were unhealthy. Some lost the fresh meals they received at school.\nMental health officials were forced to be proactive in student care outside of school.\n\"We made really conscious efforts to reach out to students that we had been seeing in the schools because for a lot of them, we're the only resource that they have,\" Bartz said.\nWhen students started to return to school, mental health officials discovered students were having a hard time getting reacquainted with daily routines and interacting with other students.\n\"I think one of the things that happened right away when we got back into schools, we started to identify some of the behaviors that came with them feeling socially isolated or not having normal routines,\" Bartz said. \"We had a lot of kids come back really anxious because they hadn't been in a setting like this before. They had been out of it and now needed to reacclimatized themselves.\"\nFor adults, the shutdown meant multiple different things. According to Dorman, some patients experienced different trauma and needed more care than others. That's why staying open was a priority for For All Seasons, she said.\n\"We knew that mental health was not an option to shut down,\" Dorman said. \"We are very much a part of the first responder healthcare line. Our major pieces were how do we keep things like the rape crisis center still moving? How do we make sure that we never closed fully? We had 25-30% of our staff in person all the time.\"\n\"... Loneliness, grief, anxiety, depression, were all up,\" Doorman said. \"I think the impact was heavy on families when the time started ticking. Our brains are not programmed for unknowns. Our brains are programmed for beginnings and ends. COVID brought a lot of uncertainty.\"\nAccording to Dorman, adults struggled adapting to regular daily routines as restrictions began to lift.\nThe numbers for adults seeking mental health services continued to rise because now people were aware of some mental health issues they had not been before, Dorman said.\n\"What we saw was that there were for the first time maybe folks were starting to recognize that they were struggling,\" she said. \"That as they're starting to put one foot back in front of the other, maybe they were feeling more anxiety than they'd ever felt before because now they had to step out of their home which had been comfortable in this time.\"\nAccording to Dorman, COVID showed that people all experience mental health in a different way.\n\"What I think COVID did was it helped us view connection differently,\" she said. \"It helped us to be able to bring language to some of the things that we were all experiencing. I think in some terms it talks about like leveling the playing field for mental health. Leveling the playing field in a way that we had language to put to what people were feeling.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Youth mental health initiatives see minimal cuts\n\n April 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SASHA ALLEN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 771\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Maryland mental health advocates and providers are relieved coming out of this year's legislative session, where state lawmakers decided against a drastic cut in funding to the state's year-old, big-money program aimed at improving the mental health of its young people.The Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports, created under the state's ambitious and expensive education reform plan called the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, will receive $70 million from the state's fiscal year 2026 budget to award mental health providers in its second round of grants. That's up from the $40 million Gov. Wes Moore originally suggested spending.\nBut with some money left over from funding this past fiscal year, the consortium plans to allocate closer to $98 million in grants. Legislators previously allocated $119.7 million over two years to set up the consortium and issued its first $111 million of grants in February 2024.\nPartly as a result of those grants, more than 80% of Maryland public schools now have some sort of mental health service available for students. And mental health advocates said the additional funding means the state's effort will continue to reach a large percentage of the state's children.\n\"This is a critical investment that's ensuring students in every corner of our state have the resources and support necessary to learn and thrive,\" said Dan Martin, senior director of public policy at the Mental Health Association of Maryland. \"We couldn't be happier.\"\nThe consortium provides mental health funding for dozens of services, including in-school counseling, substance abuse treatment and peer support groups for families and students.\nBut at the beginning of this year's difficult legislative session where the General Assembly would have to fill a $3 billion budget hole, Moore proposed a spending plan that allocated only $40 million to the youth mental health effort \u2014 even though he once proposed the program should receive $130 million for fiscal year 2026.\nThe General Assembly, however, passed a bill on the last day of the legislative session that added $30 million to the youth mental health budget on top of what Moore had proposed, leaving many relieved for the future of the program.\nSen. Katie Fry Hester, a Democrat representing Montgomery and Howard counties, said this decision was crucial for the future of the consortium and the youth mental health programs it funds.\n\"I think when you're trying to address the mental health needs of the entire state, you can't really do it piecemeal,\" Hester said.\nIf funding for the consortium had been limited to the amount suggested in Moore's budget, \"you would have to redo the entire program,\" Hester added.\nThe consortium's grant allocations are designed around a \"hub and spoke\" model that aims to include community organizations in the program. The hubs, or organizations already established in Maryland's counties, including churches and community centers, help promote and run the services of the spokes, or mental health programs. Both are funded through consortium grants.\n\"The hub and spoke model would not have worked at $40 million,\" Hester said.\nWhile the community organizations are in different stages of operation in each county, Mark Luckner, executive director of the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission, said the funding provided will allow for the program to move closer to full implementation this upcoming year.\nLuckner said a good number of active service providers have applied for the second round of funding, which the consortium is expected to issue by June 30.\nThe initial 127 grants were projected to serve about 150,000 people, \"and they're well on their way to do that globally,\" Luckner said at Thursday's consortium meeting.\nLuckner said he believes within two years, as many as 22 of the state's 24 jurisdictions will either have a fully operational or almost fully operational youth mental health hub.\n\"We should just take a moment and celebrate that accomplishment that the consortium is achieving,\" Luckner said.\nService providers agree. Jan Guszynski is the project manager for Prosper, an app that, under Uneo Health, provides mental health check ins-for adolescents. The app received $1.4 million grants to provide services in Prince George's, Frederick and Calvert counties.\nBefore the legislation was passed confirming $70 million in consortium funding for fiscal year 2026, Guszynski said she was worried for the future of not only mental health services but for the students using them.\n\"I really, really hope that we do not see these resources shuttered or too heavily impacted as time goes on,\" Guszynski said. \"Because it's hugely important.\"\nThose resources won't likely get shuttered or too heavily impacted if the General Assembly sticks with the outline it set in the budget it just passed, which projects $100 million in youth mental health funding in fiscal year 2027 and $100 million annually after that. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "As young Americans struggle with mental health, online support surges\n\n June 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAX SCHAEFFER Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1705\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Adolescents across the country have increasingly suffered from anxiety and depression over the last 10 years, and school officials in Prince George's County noticed the same trend locally.So when the county's public school system needed to support its struggling students, it did what schools and young people across the nation are doing \u2014 it turned to an online service.\nFunded by the statewide effort to bolster youth mental health, the county partnered with Hazel Health, which specializes in providing online counseling to school-age children.\n\"I think accessibility is huge,\" Emily Pasco, the school district's mental health coordinator, said of the partnership. \"That's historically been a barrier for mental health services \u2014 transportation is an issue.\"\nSupporters of online mental health services argue that they offer a convenient option in an era when providers are in short supply. According to a 2024 federal study, more than a third of the nation's residents live in an area where there aren't enough mental health professionals.\nEnter online services such as Hazel, Gaggle, Counslr and Cope Notes.\n\"We are not a silver bullet; we are not going to solve everyone's problems, but we can be a great gap-fill,\" said Andrew Post, Hazel's president.\nOnline mental health services surged in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic when most in-person options were shut down, and it has remained popular in the years since.\nWith the online medium evolving every day, there is no consensus about it among psychological researchers, but various studies have shown online interventions can do some good.\nFor example, a 2024 study from the National Institutes of Health found there were \"promising results regarding the effectiveness of online interventions in young people, especially for symptoms of anxiety and depression and for training of social functioning.\"\nMegan Taylor, an independent licensed clinical psychologist from Northern Virginia with online and in-person therapy experience, said online therapy can sometimes feel safer to patients than seeing a therapist in person.\nYet the online medium makes it easier for unlicensed or unreliable providers to provide services they aren't qualified to provide, said Taylor, who has extensive experience with youngsters with autism.\n\"I feel really passionate about the fact that there are many therapists, who advertise themselves as being neurodiversity affirming or specializing in autism, but really haven't had that training,\" Taylor said.\nDespite such concerns, online therapy is expected to grow as an option for troubled young people nationwide. Zion Market Research projects the global market for online therapy for teens to more than triple from 2023 through 2032.\nThat being the case, here's a closer look at several online mental health care options available to young people today:\nHazel\nHazel was one of the big winners in the state's first round of grants from its new youth mental health program, receiving $2.75 million in Prince George's County, $1.5 million in Baltimore City and smaller grants in Charles and St. Mary's counties.\nStudents in Prince George's County and elsewhere access Hazel's counselors through video conference, either at school or home. Post said the medium offers limitations as well as benefits for the students who access it.\n\"We are raising a generation of children who are very comfortable, for better or worse, with technology,\" Post said. \"This construct of, 'I'm going to drop you off at this office and I'll pick you up in an hour,' is a little jarring, compared to, 'I'm going to hand you this iPad and you're going to see this person and talk to them.'\"\nDespite being a proponent of telehealth therapy, Post acknowledged for severe cases, in-person treatment always has to be an option for young people.\nPrince George's County \u2014 like Miami-Dade County, Florida, where Post taught and served as an administrator \u2014 is a majority-minority community where over half of the student population qualifies for free and reduced lunch. This comes with additional mental health challenges for students to navigate.\nIn 2024, Prince George's County saw 113 homicides.\n\"Gun violence is a significant issue,\" Pasco said. \"Students being affected by either witnessing gun violence, or being affected by someone that they know being a victim of gun violence.\"\nThe top two most common reasons for referral, according to Pasco, are depression and anxiety, consistent with national trends.\nOne way Hazel looks to serve the unique needs of communities like Prince George's County is to only use providers who are licensed in the state.\n\"Number two is making sure that our population group truly reflects the population that we serve,\" Post said.\nTwo out of every five Hazel therapists fluently speak a language other than English, according to Post.\nGaggle\nLike Hazel, Gaggle \u2014 which began in 1999 as an early email communication system between teachers and students in schools \u2014 provides online therapy. The company has evolved over the last 25 years, first into an online safety management platform and now a provider of teletherapy.\nGaggle's safety management operation is still the primary service it provides to school districts, with over 1,500 districts using it. Just over 100 school districts use its telehealth service, although no Maryland school district uses it.\nGrowing the company's telehealth operation is a company priority, said Heather Durkac, Gaggle's chief innovation officer.\n\"Gaggle started and is involved with protecting those 'digital hallways' \u2014 what kids were emailing, sending, sharing, uploading, everything that was on district-provided devices or accounts,\" she said.\nIncreasing concerns about mental health and self-harm \u2014 which company officials noted through its safety monitoring service \u2014 inspired the company to offer teletherapy as well.\n\"I used to talk about [during training with school districts] if students would send something like a suicide note or share suicidal thoughts,\" Durkac said. \"Now I talk about it in a position of when students are sharing those suicidal thoughts or a suicide note. That really just compelled us to do something more.\"\nThe company made 20,000 phone calls to school districts for situations their safety analysts deemed an imminent threat for a student, and over 400,000 emails to school districts for concerns of a lower level, according to Durkac.\nDurkac shared a story of Gaggle's intervention when a student wrote a suicide note on a Google Doc on his school-issued Gmail account, which school officials saw because Gaggle's safety management system gave them access to it. Gaggle contacted the school, and officials there got the student's family and police involved. The student was found at the local train tracks and taken to a hospital.\nWith a combination of Gaggle's services, a school district could continue to work with the student to help prevent a similar situation.\n\"If it is one of those districts that has both services, they can choose to move them right into our Gaggle therapy services. If not, they have other resources,\" Durkac said.\nIf one decides to access Gaggle's therapy services, the company employs a team of licensed therapists that mostly do part-time work online while working with their own practice or serving as a supervisor somewhere else.\nCounslr\nAnother of the most widespread online counseling providers is Counslr, a service that partners with large companies, schools and communities. Counslr is partnered with school districts across 11 states but not Maryland \u2014 although it works with Child Trends, a Rockville-based nonprofit that researches child well-being.\nCounslr offers text-based mental health support with a licensed mental health professional at any hour of the day. Students complete a basic intake form and are matched with a professional who is supposed to best fit their needs.\n\"We are particularly effective at what we call 'reaching the traditionally unreachable,'\" Counslr co-founder and CEO Josh Liss said.\nHe said Counslr's text-based method helps people avoid typical hurdles like cost, inconvenience or negative stigma around getting help.\n\"The majority of the sessions on our platform deal with relationship issues,\" Liss said. \"Very challenging to have a video session, when the person you want to talk about is lying in the bed next to you.\"\nCounslr is free for the students or members of its partner school districts or organizations. That entity pays Counslr for its services to be accessible to its students or members.\nLiss said he is confident in Counslr's ability to help its users, but recognizes its limits.\n\"We very intentionally do not provide therapy,\" Liss said. \"Our counselors don't diagnose, they don't treat and they don't prescribe medication.\"\nWhen someone requires a more intensive form of care, like therapy, the company works with the school counseling office to facilitate that, Liss said.\nCope Notes\nCope Notes founder Johnny Crowder said he grew up with \"severe mental illness\" and had always resisted seeking treatment.\nOnce he got older and began to study psychology and neuroscience, that aversion turned to a curiosity and passion for helping people.\n\"I started texting people health education content from my phone,\" Crowder said, \"and eventually started building it into something more nuanced.\"\nThis is how Crowder developed Cope Notes, a subscription-based service that sends users a text at a random point in the day.\nThe texts are written by a peer, or someone with experience with whatever challenge their text references, then reviewed by Cope Notes' clinical oversight panel of mental health professionals before being sent out.\nOne of the biggest challenges is finding a text that will be general enough to apply to a range of subscribers but specific enough to help. The service is anonymous, so the providers aren't aware of who they're texting.\n\"We're serving people, let's say one of them is a rural teenager with bipolar and one person is like an urban senior with no mental health conditions,\" Crowder said. \"How the heck do you craft a content library that is applicable across all of those demographics, if you don't have that information?\"\nAnswering this question has become a big part of the company's content review process.\nNo two people ever get the same text at once, and the text comes through at a random time, although the company is working on features that will allow people to personalize their experience, according to Crowder.\nThe current Cope Notes pricing model allows someone to purchase an individual subscription for an annual cost of just over $100. Cope Notes also offers group subscriptions for companies or schools.\nCrowder recognizes Cope Notes is not a replacement for therapy. He said he feels Cope Notes is a resource that can be used to get someone ready for treatment in therapy, or help someone who has finished their therapy have some consistent support.\n\"I would say it's a great step up or step down [from therapy],\" Crowder said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As I said Tuesday, this is about Meals til Monday as a whole, but it really felt good to be honored.\"\nAllen began working volunteering for Meals til Monday during the pandemic. She then obtained her community health worker certificate to help people access services like Medicare and Medicaid. Allen said this naturally aligned with her work at Meals til Monday.\nHer recognition comes after a yearlong process of filing for grants, receiving donations and working with community organization partners to buy a refrigerated van, which allows Meals til Monday's summer program to reach more children in Dorchester County and expands the program's capabilities.\n\"It's not necessarily about how many more kids that we're reaching as much as it's about what else we can give the kids,\" Allen said. With the van, Allen said they are able to pick up large bins, also known as gaylords, of produce and frozen foods that would otherwise go bad.\nSummer is identified by Food Action and Research Center as the hungriest time for kids because they lose access to free school meals. In Dorchester County, students are provided free daily breakfast and lunch through a federally funded program called the Community Eligibility Provision.\nThis provision is available if 25% or more of the student population participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations or Medicaid, according to the United States Department of Agriculture's website.\n\"We have partnered with Dorchester County Public Schools and we are delivering two meals for seven days to anyone that registers for children 18 and under,\" Allen said.\nAllen said Meals til Monday is still providing regular weekend meal bags for anyone who needs them, and emergency food services are available with options for pick-up or delivery by appointment.\nAllen encourages anyone who wants to volunteer to sign up on the website. \"One of the things that we're trying to do as we continue to grow as an organization is to have the appropriate policies and waivers and things like that for our volunteers.\" Those can be found at midshoremealstilmonday.org.\n\"It feels absolutely wonderful. I am just so honored,\" Allen said about receiving recognition from No Kid Hungry. \"Our primary mission is to feed children.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This was about learning how to do what we do better.\"\nThe program included one-on-one mentorship, monthly virtual leadership meetings and three in-person sessions, including a two-day intensive leadership training. Participants also completed a collaborative project addressing a specific health care issue or topic.\nDanielle Wilson, senior vice president and chief nursing officer of Shore Regional Health, championed the program internally and encouraged her managers to apply.\n\"Investing in nursing leadership is investing in patient care,\" Wilson said. \"Nurse leaders have the opportunity and responsibility to continue to innovate and advance standards of care. We are grateful that three of our nurse managers had the opportunity to engage in this transformative initiative.\"\nFor more information on the Nurse Leadership Institute, visit umshoreregional.org/nli. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Working with Cecil College, Union Hospital has been offering Camp Scrubs since 2014 (pandemic notwithstanding). Hunter said the program has gained popularity with a waiting list for next year. Middle school aged students attend Camp Scrubs in June, with the high school cohort in August.\n\"We had two camps last year and this year,\" Hunter said. \"There will be three next year.\"\nTuition is $315 and eight scholarships are made available each year.\nOn Friday, Camp Scrubs was learning CPR and how to use a mechanized and an inflatable lift \u2014 a hover jack and a hover bed respectively \u2014 for easier and safer patient transfer.

I want the opportunity to do more surgery. General surgery is a very broad skillset.\"\n\"A lot of it is mentoring in the field you want to pursue,\" Iraca-Reeves said.\nIraca-Reeves said any student with health care aspirations should consider attending Camp Scrubs.

The county only has about $677,000 available in funding, and all the projects outlined total over $1 million, according to County Administrator Todd Mohn.\nQueen Anne's County Public Schools Opioid Education Partnership will utilize $209,025 of the opioid restitution funds in preventing youth opioid misuse through a school-based program and student-led awareness campaigns. It also aims to educate the broader community through public events, and distributing data-rich materials.\nQueen Anne's County Department of Health Educational Support programs will be provided $89,251 to strengthen overdose education, prevention, and response.\nThis project also includes a re-entry program for individuals released from the detention center and an expansion to the court-assisted recovery program to provide alternatives to incarceration.\nThe commissioners reached a consensus to reconsider other programs at a future time as additional resources and partnerships become available.\nCounties were awarded Maryland's opioid restitution funds to have autonomy to create plans on how to address avoiding addiction in communities, according to County Health Officer Brice Strang.\nPrograms that were traditionally funded have been denied funding this year, including the public school program, he said.\nStrang is now recommending the Board of Health create a county evidence-based mechanism to support current programming and showcase how it is working in the community, such as the school based programing. Strang recommended using the funding to backfill the programs, and \"wait and see\" on federal and state funding.\nA constant messaging to youth in particular is important, he said, and the commissioners praised the works of the Drug Free Coalition, the Student Ambassadors, and county partnerships.\n\"One of the things we already know is prevention is cheaper than treatment,\" Strang said.\nRemembering when programs initially began, Commission President Chris Corchiarino noted just how far the community has come in regard to opioid awareness and preventing overdoses.\nTo continually keep overdose numbers down, Corchiarino said, new initiatives are always needed to keep awareness moving forward and make sure preventive programs stay at the forefront.\n\"And that forefront is in our schools, for sure,\" Commissioner Phil Dumenil said.\nMore information about Queen Anne's County Drug Free Coalition can be found at qacgoespurple.org.\nIn other business it was noted, phase three of the South Island Trail extension project took one step closer as a construction and paving bid was awarded to David A. Bramble Inc. in the amount of $593,030.\nThis approximately 3,500 feet portion of the project faced time constraints due to its wooded and wildlife areas and is set to begin Sept. 1.\nWith a grant through the Maryland Office of Tourism Development, Queen Anne's County Economic and Tourism Development will be taking the show on the road with a mobile visitors center trailer to be purchased from Advantage Trailers for $91,778.\nThe trailer will serve to elevate tourism throughout the county by strategically placing it in high traffic areas and events. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gamble said the program has since changed to reflect the evolving drug trends in the county.\nGamble said he created Talbot Goes Purple to start a conversation the county wasn't having. He said he was speaking at a fundraiser when he had this realization.\n\"I stood up and I said, 'raise your hand if you talk to your kids about drinking and driving,' and all 400 hands went up. And I said, 'raise your hands if you talk to your kids, your grandkids, about seatbelt use,' and 400 hands went up. And then I said, 'Raise your hand if you talk to your kids about prescription painkillers,' and only 11 hands went up,\" Gamble said.\nFor Gamble, these were conversations that parents, guardians and community members needed to be having with their children to give them the proper tools to handle situations involving drugs.\n\"In my world of policing, 80% of what we deal with is connected to some form of substance abuse,\" Gamble said.\nMaryland has tracked much fewer overdose deaths for the past two years. According to Gamble, there has only been one overdose in Talbot County this year.\nHowever, fentanyl is still a major concern, he said. \"We're not seeing any heroin in Talbot County, Maryland that doesn't have fentanyl in it,\" Gamble said. \"We're seeing a lot of cocaine in Talbot County, Maryland that has fentanyl in it.\"\nEducational efforts through September will be extensive, Goes Purple organizers said, and they will address fentanyl along with other substances.\nTalbot Goes Purple Coordinator Kelley Callaghan said the broadening of the program's focus to include education on marijuana is more important than ever with a potential dispensary coming to Easton, and Gamble agrees.\n\"Youth are being hospitalized for marijuana use,\" Gamble said. \"I want parents to understand, you know, the weed they smoked when they were in college 30 years ago is not the same weed today.\"\nCallaghan highlighted alcohol as one of the commonly abused drugs by youth.\nThere will be posters around Talbot County schools of a real prescription pill next to a fake one, showing how difficult it is to tell the difference.\nTeaching the youth about the Good Samaritan Law, which protects individuals from prosecution for minor drug or alcohol offenses when calling 911 for a medical emergency, is a critical part of the prevention tactics, Goes Purple organizers said.\nIn addition, Talbot Goes Purple provides Narcan trainings and has installed Narcan boxes at several business and trained the employees how to use them. Narcan, or Naloxone, is a medication used during opioid overdoses to reverse or reduce the effects of the drug.\nThere is also a comprehensive toolkit on the Goes Purple website to help families navigate recovery services and find help regardless of insurance status.\nFor resources regarding substance use, visit talbotgoespurple.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "QAC Goes Purple 2025: standing stronger than ever\n\n September 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 709\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n QUEEN ANNE'S COUNTY \u2014 QAC Goes Purple is once again rallying the community this season to stand against substance abuse, as county leaders note progress but stress that education must continue.The countywide initiative, launched in 2017, is a collaboration of the Queen Anne's County Office of the Sheriff and the Queen Anne's County Drug-Free Coalition, in partnership with the Opioid Intervention Team and Health Department, Queen Anne's County Public Schools, the county commissioners, the Mid-Shore Community Foundation and other agencies. Its mission is to raise awareness of substance abuse and opioid overdose prevention.\nOne of the program's first actions was to place six opioid signs across the county, updated weekly to show overdose data. At the time, opioid misuse was on the rise.\nIn 2018, Queen Anne's County reported 122 overdoses and 16 overdose-related deaths. By 2024, those numbers had dropped to 18 overdoses and four deaths.\nSo far in 2025, the county has recorded eight overdoses \u2014 and no overdose deaths \u2014 an encouraging sign, officials said. But they stressed that continued education and prevention efforts are needed to keep the numbers low.\n\"Even one death due to opioids is too many, and work must continue,\" coalition members said.\nEducation, Prevention and Treatment\nThrough awareness campaigns, free Narcan distribution by the county Health Department, a standard reporting system developed by Queen Anne's County Emergency Services, and the QAC Data Dashboard, local leaders say the effort is showing results.\nIn 2025, the initiative expanded its banners across the county to more than 100, all carrying the slogan: \"Taking a stand against substance abuse.\"\nProgress is being seen \"across the board,\" said Warren Wright of QAC Goes Purple. He credited strict penalties for drug sellers, enforcement against tobacco and liquor outlets that sell to minors, and the strong work of the county's Drug Court.\nAlso contributing are Prevention Services, Peer Support Workers and the Local Management Board, which is conducting an asset-mapping project. The county Board of Education has added Bodkin life skills programs for younger students. The commissioners are working with neighboring counties to expand treatment services for residents at the Whitsitt Center.\nYouth Involvement\nRecognizing that most young people make choices about alcohol, tobacco and drug use during middle school, QAC Goes Purple has focused on youth outreach.\nA Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that more than 13% of Queen Anne's County high school students reported taking a prescription drug not prescribed to them \u2014 a troubling trend that highlights the need for early conversations at home and in schools, officials said.\nTo reach peers directly, the QAC Drug-Free Student Ambassador Program includes students from public and private schools who design posters, lead team-building events and stage award-winning activities.\n\"We believe that involvement is key to prevention for our students,\" Wright said. \"Join a team, try a club, and discover your passion. After-school programs and activities are offered through schools, the YMCA and the Giving the Edge Foundation.\"\nChanging Perceptions\nQAC Goes Purple emphasizes that substance use disorder is not a choice but a disease that affects the brain. Understanding the science of addiction, officials say, can reduce stigma and encourage compassion.\nSeptember is recognized as National Recovery Month, followed by Substance Use Prevention Month in October. International Overdose Awareness Day is marked every year on Aug. 31 to honor those lost and support families affected by substance use disorders.\n\"We can all make a difference,\" said Emily Keller, Maryland's special secretary of overdose response. \"Hundreds of lives are saved every year from bystanders who had naloxone and knew what to do in the event of an overdose. We have to make sure that anyone who wants naloxone can access it wherever they are and whenever they need it.\"\nFree naloxone is available at the Nielsen Center, 205 N. Liberty St., Centreville.\nUpcoming Event\nThe sixth annual Going Purple Together event will be held Sept. 27 at Church Hill Park from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The family-friendly gathering will feature live music, food trucks, face painting, dunk tanks and raffle prizes, while celebrating recovery and raising awareness.\nThe community is also invited to complete the QAC Goes Purple Marijuana Survey, available at the county Health Department website under the Behavioral Health tab.\n\"Everyone in Queen Anne's County can keep fighting by knowing the facts, discussing them with loved ones, colleagues and friends,\" Wright said.\nMore information is available at qacgoespurple.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Local testicular cancer survivor shoots for a hole in one\n\n September 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Amelia Blades Steward | Section: Events \n \n 867\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n According to Johns Hopkins Brady Urological Institute, testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in young men, with nearly 10,000 new diagnoses each year in the United States. It is highly curable when it first develops but can quickly spread if not treated promptly.Andrew Dorbin of Preston is a husband, father and testicular cancer survivor who hopes to educate men about the risks and symptoms of testicular cancer at the \"Putts Fore! Nuts\" miniature golf tournament on Oct. 18 from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Embers Island Mini-Golf in Ocean City. The rain date will be Oct. 25.\nDorbin was diagnosed with late-stage testicular cancer (Choriocarcinoma) in the spring of 2023. It then metastasized to his lungs and abdomen.\nWhile undergoing multiple rounds of chemotherapy, he was overwhelmed by the generosity of his family, friends and community, who rallied to support him and his family through his diagnosis and treatment. That experience of compassion and care lit a fire in him.\n\"During my longest inpatient stay at Johns Hopkins Hospital, I witnessed other patients facing their battle alone without the same support system I had. That was hard for me to stomach. It made me realize that I wanted to give back when I was able and build something that could offer strength, resources and connection to others navigating their fight against testicular cancer,\" Dorbin said.\n\"Honestly, I'm not particularly good at regular golf \u2014 I'm only there for my friend's comic relief \u2014 but I've always enjoyed miniature golf and came up with this funny tournament name on one of the sickest days of my treatment,\" he said.\nThe idea eventually grew, and Dorbin founded the Wayfinders Testicular Health Fund, a component fund of Chesapeake Charities Inc., a Maryland-based nonprofit. The fund is focused on raising awareness, providing education and building a supportive community fighting this disease.\nHe is committed to making testicular health a topic that young men are not afraid to talk about and ensuring that no one faces cancer without a community standing beside them. The tournament is the first step to accomplishing that.\n\"I chose an amazing partner in Chesapeake Charities to help make my dream a reality. The money that was used to found this venture came from what was left over from my personal GoFundMe campaign, making this essentially a 100% community-funded initiative,\" Dorbin said.\nThe fund's fundraising efforts will go toward community networking opportunities and mental health and wellness programs to ensure no one feels like they are facing the testicular cancer fight alone. Dorbin hopes his educational outreach will encourage young men to challenge the stigmas and pay attention to their health.\n\"We are encouraging our communities of young men, ages 14 to 35, to be aware of their bodies and to take action when something doesn't feel right,\" he said.\nDorbin reflects on his journey, sharing, \"My journey almost ended before it started. When I found the lump, I almost didn't act. It seems petty now, but I was worried about the cost of my health insurance deductible and thought it was nothing serious. Through the encouragement of a friend who was a nurse, I decided to get it checked out. If I had not acted as quickly as I did, I'm not sure I would be sitting here today.\"\nHe said that, like him, men in their early 20s and 30s feel they are invincible and that they will not develop any major medical issues.\n\"No one wants to go to the doctor when they are young. Also, I had never been shown how to correctly check myself for abnormalities in my testicles. Self-examination is key to early detection,\" he said.\nDorbin hopes that teens and adults will participate in the tournament while learning more about the disease and how to protect themselves and their loved ones. He shares that the event will also create community connection \u2014 helping people learn who the disease is affecting, what support people need and connecting people to resources in the community.\n\"This event is going to be a blast. Participants can expect to play two rounds of mini-golf, all while challenging their knowledge, luck, and putting skills. Hole Hecklers \u2014 professional comedians will set up a mock sports casting both at one of the miniature golf holes and roast participants as they putt. We also have a variety of prizes and awards that will make the event enjoyable for everyone. For me, the best part is that you don't have to be standing on the podium to walk away a winner,\" Dorbin said.\nIn the future, Dorbin hopes that the Wayfinders Testicular Health Fund can support outings for survivors of testicular cancer and help build a community of survivors, since many men still suffer in silence with the stigma attached to the disease.\n\"This launch would not be possible without the incredible generosity of my friends, family, and neighbors here on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Their belief in this mission, and in me, has carried me through the toughest years of my life,\" he adds.\nSponsorships are still available for the event. Registration information and sponsorship opportunities are available at wayfindersthf.org. Participants are limited, and registration will be available online on Sept. 18. Registration is non-refundable.\nFor further information, contact Andrew Dorbin at wayfindersthf@gmail.com. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Wellness center offers support for mothers on the Shore\n\n October 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 661\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The Village Maternal Holistic Wellness Center opened its doors last October to provide women on the Eastern Shore with a single, trusted source for various services.Samantha Basham Loza was inspired to create a space like this after having her first child in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. She was astounded by the lack of resources, education and community she had during this time.\n\"I was so blindsided by the entire experience, and it was really frustrating because I consider myself a highly educated person that works hard to find the right resources,\" Loza said. \"And the fact that I couldn't even find what I needed to help me at each stage of this process was just completely shocking.\"\nThe entire process of giving birth was scary for Loza. She was at a hospital in Anne Arundel County and was given an epidural that made her completely numb from her neck down, which she said caused her to have a panic attack.\nLoza said her daughter was immediately transferred to the NICU after delivery.\nBecause she was was numb from the epidural, the baby was crowning without Loza realizing or feeling it, and none of the doctors or nurses noticed. This caused Loza's daughter to have meconium aspiration syndrome. According to John's Hopkins Medicine, meconium aspiration syndrome occurs in 5 to 10% of births.\n\"I was reflecting on that entire experience thinking like, 'How is this the standard?'\" Loza said.\nWith her first child, Loza said she didn't have the knowledge base on the process of giving birth, breastfeeding or managing hormonal changes. She described the experience as isolating.\n\"We don't talk about pregnancy often enough, and how isolating it can be, and all the changes and all the sacrifices. We don't talk about fertility issues often enough. We don't talk about miscarriages enough. We don't teach any of it,\" Loza said.\nShe said her goal with the wellness center is to start these conversations and create community while doing so.\nThe center offers an array of classes and playgroups for children. There are courses for pregnant women and new moms, and the University of Maryland's obstetrics practice comes in to talk about fertility and prenatal care quarterly.\nIn addition, the wellness center has birth doulas, massage therapists, lactation consultants, a speech language pathologist, a pediatric nurse practitioner and a craniosacral therapist, who will be starting in November.\n\"A really big misconception about the name of the business, The Village Maternal Holistic Wellness Center, is that holistic means crunchy and it doesn't,\" Loza said. \"It just means we're considering you as a whole person.\"\nLoza defined a doula as a non-medical support person who provides educational, physical and emotional support during pregnancy, birth and postpartum and also helps connect clients with resources.\nThe center recently received a grant from the Talbot County Health Department to fund the training of 18 new doulas, four of whom are bilingual and two of which whom exclusively speak Spanish. The grant is also assisting the doulas with Medicaid credentialing.\nWhen Loza got pregnant with her second child, she decided to have a home birth midwife, one of the first contacts she made when looking into starting her business.\nLoza said her pregnancy and birth with her son was a completely different experience than with her daughter.\n\"It was so personal. She knew exactly where I was coming from. She knew exactly what was happening with my mental state, and what I was eating and all the things. And she always had a recommendation for a book to read, or YouTube videos to watch or things like that,\" Loza said.\n\"Though she planned to deliver at home, she was transferred to the Easton Hospital because her son's heart rate was low. Her midwife stayed by her side and advocated for her throughout the process.\nAfter having two very different birthing experiences, Loza has become passionate about educating pregnant women about the entirety of the process. She hopes to expand the centers services by opening a nonprofit arm in the near future. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She credits her doctor, Audrey Drummey, for saving her life.\nDrummey is a doctor in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Maryland Shore Medical Group in Easton. During the event, Drummey highlighted the importance of proactive genetic evaluation and early detection, especially if the disease runs in the family.\nShe emphasized the importance of access to genetic testing in health care and leveraging available resources.\nDrummy said routine mammograms should start at age 40 unless there is a family history of breast cancer in which earlier screening may be recommended and potentially covered by health insurance.\nIn addition, she said a healthy diet, regular exercise, intaking less than seven alcoholic drinks a week and breastfeeding are good preventative measures.\nFor Townsend who said she doesn't like to be vulnerable, it was important to reframe her vulnerability as a strength. As she told her story, she was nervous and emotional while recounting her experience as a breast cancer survivor.\nShe encouraged attendees to check in on their friends post-treatment saying that community is incredibly important because a diagnoses like this can instill fear and change your perspective entirely.\n\"People think that we go through this experience, and when it's over, that we're OK. And we are OK, we survived, but for your mental health it's still something where every little thing that goes wrong, there's still that fear,\" Townsend said.\nTownsend does not want others to live in fear, which is why she encourages other women \u2014 like her two sisters \u2014 to do self breast exams and early screenings. UM Shore Regional Community Health outreach specialist Catalina Billings encourages self examinations because \"no one knows your body like you do.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "I don't come from political lineage\n\n September 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Kiersten Hacker; Capital News Service | Page: A4 | Section: News \n \n 600\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Gov. Wes Moore fended off questions Tuesday on whether he'll run in the 2024 Democratic presidential primary during an interview with global news organization Semafor, saying he had no interest in higher office and turning the subject to his nontraditional political background.\"I think it's really important for people to remember that I am probably the most improbable governor in this country,\" Moore said in answer to the first question from Semafor cofounder and Editor-at-large Steve Clemons. \"I'm a person who has never come from a political lineage.\" Moore, an author, nonprofit executive and former Army officer, had not held political office before winning the governor's election in 2022.Moore turned his focus to Maryland, discussing plans to revive the state's economy through targeted investments in its assets and better serve constituents with a data-driven approach to policy changes.Moore often defines Maryland as \"asset-rich and strategy-poor,\" and cites the contrast presented by the state's high concentration of prominent institutions of higher education, military facilities and government agencies, such as the National Security Agency, with its sluggish economic growth rate of.2% in the past 4 years. The current economic strategy of spreading funding across numerous projects \"doesn't make sense,\" he said, explaining he'll use a more focused approach.In June, Moore established the Maryland Economic Council, charging it with creating economic recommendations by the next legislative session in January. After the General Assembly passed numerous measures to affect systemic budgetary changes during the last session, a report from the Department of Legislative Services predicted a $418 million structural deficit for fiscal year 2025.Moore said his administration will use data to drive policy decisions, especially when looking to minimize socioeconomic disparities, and he used environmental injustice in Baltimore as an example.\"You can't understand what these disparities look like if we aren't able to fully appreciate the measure of intentionality that very much existed in the creation of that and the lack of intentionality when it comes to how we're going to address it.\" The administration must consider the root causes of poverty, investing in transit, the public education system and programs to combat the teacher shortage, Moore said, to jumpstart economic growth.Creating new opportunities for young people to succeed in different areas will help fight juvenile crime and keep violence out of communities, Moore said. Using data and technology in innovative ways can also help ensure that solutions to crime are predictive rather than reactive.Increasing public safety is his top priority, Moore said, highlighting the need for \"appropriate intensity, absolute integrity, and full accountability\" in the policing system as well as a need for crisis intervention teams to shift the response of mental health calls away from police officers. Over $100 million was invested directly in behavioral health, Moore said.Moore noted that police officers respond to all situations, and many times they are met with circumstances they cannot fix.He called for change, saying that public safety is in part a matter of creating a better livelihood for people.Moore said his administration invested $122 million in local law enforcement, $17.5 million of which went to Baltimore City, where the police department has been under a federal agreement to make reforms since 2016.Moore also invested in intelligence sharing through the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center and organized crime units.In Baltimore, other reform means combating gun trafficking, filling the police shortage with well-trained officers, and developing more intentional solutions, said Moore, who places special importance on these issues as a Baltimore native.\"I love my state, all 24 jurisdictions. But I'm a Baltimorean,\" Moore said.\"That's who I am. Can't understand me if you don't understand Baltimore.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

No public comments were offered at each of the three readings of the bill.\"Earlier this year it was identified that we have not used the proceeds of the 2019 bond issuance for renovation of the detention center. And as a result, the commissioners have directed us to reallocate the funding of the project,\" County Attorney Stewart Barroll said.In other business, the commissioners heard a proposal about a potential Hobbs Solar Project to be built on the capped landfill.Jack Martell, manager of business development, and Greg Werner, manager of Massachusetts-based Nexamp Solar, Inc. presented a slide show and answered questions from the commissioners about the proposed 5,000-panel solar project.The company proposed to \"finance, build, own and maintain\" solar facilities on 15 acres at the landfill at 26375 Hobbs Road and \"extend the financial benefits of the generated electricity, land lease and tax revenue\" to the county government and public schools.Nexamp Solar projected a total benefit of $121,152 at the end of the first year, and a total benefit at the end of its 20-year lifespan of nearly $2 million.The commissioners took no action on the proposal at this meeting.Also on the agenda was Susan Runnels, director of the Caroline Human Services Council, who discussed transportation needs and how they're currently being to serve two towns in the county.\"In my opinion, mobility on demand doesn't work in Caroline County,\" Runnels said.Few people used the service, which serves Greensboro and Federalsburg residents for in-county rides. Those towns qualify for state grant funding for transportation in lower income areas.For example, Runnels said the service, which uses Delmarva Community Transit, supplied 48 rides from Greensboro and 15 from Federalsburg from March through June. Many of those rides were called by the same persons, she said.\"I don't think this is feasible for us,\" she said. \"But we need some kind of transportation in the county we'd be better off going back to taxi service.\" Runnels said she would prefer to take almost $27,000 in state grants that she has to return to the state and use those funds to help to pay for driver's education classes for teen drivers or vehicle repairs in the target communities.\"We can't have our dollars just sitting in a parking lot waiting for a call,\" she said. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nJack Martell, left, manager of business development, and Greg Werner, manager of Massachusetts-based Nexamp Solar, Inc. present a slide show and answer questions from the Caroline County Commissioners at their Sept. 12 meeting about a proposed solar project at the Hobbs landfill. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He served on the Dorchester County Council, representing District 5, from 2014 through 2018.

A grand opening celebration is planned when the new elevator is finished in spring 2024.\nNew carpet, neutral walls, fresh shelving and new furniture create welcoming decor in the more open spaces of the library's main floor. The main desk is bigger and moved away from the wall, making it easier for staff members to see most of the library's interior.\nBennett said she wanted people to experience the library as \"bright, open and inviting.\"\n\"This is perfect,\" customer Romont Fletcher of Denton said Dec. 20 as he set up his laptop on the desk attached to an upholstered chair. He had not been in the library for a year and was surprised when he walked in. \"This is a great renovation,\" he said.\n\"This is good space, and it's flexible space,\" Executive Director Debby Bennett said. \"It's a well-built library.\" Bennett, who has been with the library since 1983, will retire in June 2024.\n\"In 1983, people came in, got their books and checked them out and went home,\" Bennett said. \"Now people come to stay, whether it's work on our computer, hang out with their friends in the Teen Zone, a family comes in and spends time looking for materials and just spending time here, small meetings in the study room, research in the Maryland room.\"\nThe $2.1 million renovation project began Jan. 2, 2023. Bennett, the Caroline County Board of Library Trustees and library staff met their goal of reopening the first floor to the public before Christmas.\nThe central branch has experienced many changes in its 62-year history. Card catalogs and hand-stamping due dates have been computerized. Circulating books are still a staple, but today library card holders can check out a Cricut machine, sewing machines and even fishing poles.\nThe central branch has 13,739 card holders who can check out materials, but visitors can obtain guest passes to use the public computers.\nAs if to illustrate the changes, two days after reopening, four teenaged young men checked out software to play games on library Xboxes in the Teen Zone.\nThe renovation was funded mainly by two \"highly competitive\" State Library Capital Grants, Bennett said.\nIn addition to replacing the roof slates on the library's 1995 addition, the building underwent extensive first floor renovations.\nPhase 2 includes improving the elevator in 2024.\nThe Phase 1 grant in fiscal year 2023 financed 79%, or $917,000 of the project.\nThe library board provided the local match of $244,000 from their John Hargreaves fund.\nThis phase included replacing three HVAC units at the end of their useful life, improving lighting, upgrading the emergency fire alarm system and phone system, enhancing electrical capacity for increased technology, removing the wall dividing the two children's rooms, providing a family bathroom adjacent to the children's areas, increasing seating capacity, improving sight lines and creating quiet areas. The improvements brought the library into compliance with ADA requirements.\nThe cost didn't include shelving, furniture and other additional costs that were incurred throughout the renovation, about $335,236. The library paid for those costs, except for $78,000 raised by the Friends of the Library for shelving for the adult, young adult and Maryland Room collections.\nPhase 2 is being funded by a fiscal year 2024 State Library Capital Grant that pays for 78%, or $467,000, of the project, with the remaining $132,000 provided by the Caroline County Commissioners.\nThis phase includes replacing the elevator, which is \"at the end of its useful life,\" Bennett said.\nThe new elevator will comply with ADA requirements and current codes.\nThe phase also includes replacing the addition's 4,000 square foot roof with artificial slate, which had deteriorated and become a \"serious safety hazard,\" Bennett said.\nThe elevator provides access to public space, administrative offices and the third floor attic storage area.\n\"The (two-sided) main service desk is going to work a lot better for staff to both answer basic questions and check out items, and also to be able to work with people with more complex reference questions,\" Bennett said. \"And also we have so much better visibility of the other desks and more areas of library to see who might need help (and) for security.\"\n\"Back in 1995 when we renovated and added on, we didn't have cell phones and laptops and iPads,\" Bennett said, adding that the internet was fairly new then.\n\"The MakerSpace used to be our reference area in 1995 with 7-foot shelves of reference books. Now, all the reference materials are online.\"\nMore square footage not taken up by books \"frees up more people space,\" she said.\nThere's a lot to figure out,\" Bennett said. \"Half our staff are new and didn't work down here. And for all the staff, it's a new layout. So it's a matter of figuring out procedures and ironing out all the little extra things. So opening like this without a big fanfare - and this is a quiet time of the year anyway - is giving us time to figure a lot so that things go smoothly for staff and customers.\"\n\"I've seen a lot of changes, but this library has always been innovative,\" Bennett said. \"It's always been forward-thinking and also thinking: What does the community need?

That can also help bring more transparency to city halls, local law enforcement and school districts.\n\"The more information that we share with the public about what's happening in town, the better. We also have a live feed for all of our council, board and commission meetings. If residents aren't able to make it, they can always watch the recordings from our website,\" said Cook, mayor of Easton.\nBut social media also magnifies broader contemporary distrust of the media, government, politicians and other institutions. It can also bring rumor mills and coarse discourse.\n\"From a city perspective, we just wish people would pick up the phone and call us. We are constantly fighting the rumor mill,\" said Groves Lloyd, mayor of Lodi, Wisconsin (a small town near Madison).\nGroves Lloyd identifies herself as a \"progressive feminist\" and \"small town mayor\" on her X/Twitter account where she is no fan of former president Donald Trump. But the Wisconsin mayor said she's pulled back on her progressive posts, especially on Facebook, because of the atmosphere of social media.\nIn Montana, Nelson, the mayor of Belgrade (which has a population approaching 13,000 people), worries all the political tensions at the local level discourages candidates for office and shortens tenures for staff and officeholders. He avoids social media altogether.\n\"I'm not on Facebook. I'm not on social media,\" said Nelson. \"You can call me, or if you need me, you can text me. That's my technology.\"\nFor a more expansive look at the issue check out our story online and in our national e-edition on Monday, March 11. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This increase will go toward the capital project request for planned Chapel District Elementary School renovations and other capital projects.\nThe increase in the education budget is due, in part, to the implications of the Maryland Blueprint for Education plan. Blueprint is a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state by increasing education funding by $3.8 billion each year over the next 10 years.\n\"Maryland Blueprint required local share funding to increase by $1.053 million for FY2025 budget,\" Martha Sparks, finance director for Talbot County, said at the Tuesday meeting. \"In addition to the mandated funding, the county has included an additional appropriation of $2.6 million. Funding to support Talbot County Schools increased overall by $3.65 million above FY24 levels.\"\nEducation spending represents 37.7% of the county's total proposed budget. These numbers include Talbot County Public Schools, Chesapeake College and the Talbot County Free Library expenses.\nThe budget also allocates an additional $1.5 million in capital improvement project funding for Talbot County Public Schools to prioritize other projects.\nThe budget discussion included the option to expand the amendment of the 1-cent increase in property tax rates for public safety.\nIn November 2020, Talbot County voters approved an amendment allowing a 1-cent increase to the property tax rate to support public safety spending. This increase began in the FY2022 budget and will continue until the FY2026 budget.\nRevenues from the 1-cent increase have been used to fund 26 new public safety positions across departments, such as deputies, paramedics, emergency medical technicians and 911 operators. The funds from the amendment have allowed for inclusion of sheriff's office, paramedics/EMTs and correctional officers in enhanced retirement programs for public safety employees.\nSparks noted that the county has used more than the funds provided by the 1-cent increase to public safety.\n\"The county has used more than the revenues generated from the 1 cent to enhance public safety personnel serving the citizens and visitors of Talbot County,\" she said.\nThe council has the option to allow county residents to extend the 1-cent increase beyond FY2026 through a ballot initiative for voters in the November 2024 general election.\nClay Stamp, county manager for Talbot County, expressed his admiration for the county's finance team for their work on the budget.\n\"There's a lot of hard work that went into drafting the FY 25 proposed balanced budget,\" Stamp said. \"While we're here tonight, I want to thank the council for your cooperation and support over the last number of months.\"\nTwo public hearings will be held to gather community input before final approval.\nA public hearing will be held on May 7 at 2 p.m. in the Talbot County Courthouse and at 7 p.m. in the Easton Elementary School cafeteria, located at 307 Glenwood Avenue. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This is an increase of $3.65 million from last year's budget and $2.8 million above the required local share funding.

Capital projects included in the 2025 budget include an expansion of the Talbot County Free Library in St. Michaels and renovation of the Chapel District Elementary School in Cordova.\nSparks told the council that during a review by Moody's Investors Service of the county's budget, Talbot was given rave reviews. Sparks said Moody's Investors Service described the budget as \"very strong, and the management team is generally conservative in its budgeting.\"\nPUBLIC HEARINGDuring the public hearing, Dana Newman, director of the Talbot County Free Library, thanked the council for funding the expansion of the Talbot County Free Library and supporting education for the county.\n\"The St. Michaels library is just a wonderful place. I was there this morning, there were people from the Benedictine school, their staff were just making them laugh, it was a really joyful experience to see that.

Sherman began by thanking the council for its support.\n\"I want to thank you for your support of the St. Michael's expansion,\" Sherman said. \"I think it's such a wonderful example of community involvement and responsibility as community members.

    "content": "Caroline County commissioners discuss FY 2025 budget, years ahead\n\n May 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 878\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 On May 7 the Caroline County Commissioners convened to present the fiscal year 2025 budget, but the budget discussion looked at what's to come in years ahead.Discussions featured two prominent, long-term issues \u2014 the county's revenue-generating landfill and the state-mandated Blueprint for Education program.\nThe budget overview also covered the operating budget, capital budgets, proposed tax rates and municipal real property tax differential rates.\nLooking forward, Commissioner Larry Porter said The Mid-Shore II Regional Landfill will generate $420,000 a year in revenue if it stays in Caroline County.\nIn the late 1980s, due to new federal regulations, the counties had to close their landfills and replace them with new landfills. In response to this new regulation, Talbot, Caroline and Queen Anne's counties engaged with MES to form a partnership where each county would take turns hosting a landfill for a 20-year term. Kent County later joined that partnership.\nCaroline County is hosting the current landfill and, under the original arrangement, would be off the hook at the end of 2030 when Queen Anne's County would take over the responsibility of host. However, the partnering counties have agreed to allow the landfill to stay in Caroline County for 12 years longer than initially planned.\nDan Fox, deputy administrator, said the county will receive a revenue increase of around $12.3 million over the duration of the extended agreement at a meeting held earlier on May 7. The counties agreed on a $3 per ton post fee until 2030. In 2031 it will rise to $6.\n\"Landfill is a revenue benefit to the county. Down the road, we will need this money,\" Porter said.\nThe other topic discussed by commissioners was the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a massive educational program that includes salary increases for teachers and more funding for early education.\nThe commissioners are concerned about its expense to the county.\nWhile dramatically boosting state funding for public education over a decade, the Blueprint also asks local school districts \u2014 and taxpayers \u2014 to do their part.\nIn a letter to Gov. Wes Moore, the Maryland Association of Counties last November listed a litany of concerns. They said the Blueprint's cost estimates don't take into account the bottom-line local impact of several major spending items, including construction costs for additional classrooms needed under the plan's expansion of pre-K and the new minimum $60,000 teacher salary starting in 2026.\n\"It is a bad program and we have to figure out a way to pay for this,\" Porter said.\nEducation-related expenses made up the top expenditure for Caroline County in FY 2025. The Board of Education will receive about $17.1 million if the proposed budget is approved, about $2.3 million more than last year.\nRounding out the top four expenditures are the sheriff ($5,534,994), corrections ($5,889,769) and emergency medical services ($5,563,069).\nThe top three revenue generators for fiscal year 2025 are property taxes ($28,704,000), income taxes ($20,200,000) and a disparity grant from the state ($4,686,791).\nThough commissioners voted to maintain the same tax rates as last year, the county will bring in more revenue from property taxes in FY 2025 due to an increase in the assessed value of properties in Caroline County.\nBecause of this increase, the state will provide less funding to the county in its annual disparity grant.\nAccording to the Maryland Department of Legislative Services, the disparity grant is \"where the local income tax is below 75% of the statewide average. Under the program each eligible jurisdiction receives a grant that enables the per capita local income tax revenues to reach 75% of the statewide average.\"\nDeputy Administrator Dan Fox said that our state disparity grant is being funded at $615,525 less than last year.\n\"That is a state-driven formula that is based off of wealth. We changed in percentage there, which means we receive less money this year,\" Fox said.\nThe tax differential rate was discussed for various municipalities.\nPorter described the tax differential as \"revenue that the county does not collect. It is not money being taken from the towns or given to the towns. It does not affect town budgets in any way. It is money that the town does not collect.\"\nFox said, \"The county is looking to maintain the property tax rate at 98 cents per 100 of all unincorporated areas as well as the towns that do not receive a differential,\" he said.\n\"This year we are looking provide Denton with the same tax rate as the prior year with 92 cents- a six cents differential to get you to 92 cent county tax rate. Federalsburg will have a county tax rate of 90 cents. Greensboro will remain at 92 cents. Preston would receive and remain at 97 cents and Ridgely would be at 93 cents,\" said Fox.\nCommissioner Frank Bartz said they go through the budget line by line. And although there were some conversations, by and large they agreed on each item.\nTwo people Sue Simmons, interim director of Caroline County Arts Council and Dr. Cliff Coppersmith, President of Chesapeake College, both came up and stated how grateful they were for the county's support.\nThey had scheduled an hour and a half for this meeting, but it only took around 45 minutes. One commissioner, Travis Breeding, was \"under the weather\" and did not attend live.\nThe FY 2025 budget is scheduled for potential adoption during the Commissioners of Caroline County meeting on May 28. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS \u2014 On Monday morning, many community members gathered for the ribbon cutting ceremony for an approximately $4.5 million renovation project to help serve the community of St. Michaels.The St. Michaels Community Center has been operating for over 30 years and has provided various supports through community pantries, events, senior and adult programs, youth programs and community gardens.\nLori Morris, the center's board chair, said she is excited to continue serving the community 2,500 meals a week and distributing groceries to neighbors in need.\n\"The outstanding center staff, both past and current, many of whom are here, not only provided ongoing input to the design and construction process but kept as many of our programs running as possible while we were out of the building,\" Morris said.\nThe approximately 5,700-square-foot building now houses a modern commercial kitchen, two classrooms, a technology center, a gallery and upstairs offices for staff. The main level of the building will serve multiple uses, including cafe seating, a space for speakers or performances and a place where people can pick up items from the center's community pantry.\nThe 800-square-foot commercial kitchen will serve the new Culinary Arts & Hospitality Workforce Development Program and the center's Community Cafe, which serves chef-made meals free of charge to anyone experiencing food insecurity.\nThe two classrooms on the other side of the gallery will be used primarily for children's programming but also for adult programs.\nA technology center will have desks and computers for different organizations and nonprofits.\nDuring the ribbon cutting ceremony, Morris praised her predecessor Langley Shook, former chair of the board of directors.\nMorris said that Shook's leadership was the foundation of the project. The renovation was his vision, and he and his wife, Karen Shook, threw themselves into the fundraising, representing the committee before the town commissioners and the Historic District Committee.\nShook spoke about the work that many put into the project and thanked everyone involved in making the community center what it is today.\n\"The programs have been expanded, the staff has been strengthened,\" Shook said. \"Our fundraising has made this platform possible and successful, and I think our greatest days are yet to come.\"\nOne of the speakers, State Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), requested that all people who had attended St. Michaels Middle or High School come to stand with him as he presented the St. Michaels Community Center board of directors a citation in recognition for the work that was put into the community project.\n\"Because we do citations and we do projects, and it's part of the government doing something, but this is the will of the people,\" Mautz said. \"This is what the town needed. This is what the town wanted, and by golly, this is what the town was going to get. So it's a great day for everybody.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This center offers year-round comprehensive early care, education and family support to children from birth to 3 years of age, as well as their families.\nMary Kay Verdery, grants administrator for Talbot County, gave opening remarks outside of the center.\nVerdery told community members the renovated space, including classrooms for up to 65 infants and toddlers, office space, kitchen and laundry facilities for the program, was possible due to the grant the center received.\nMaria Maguire, health officer for the Talbot County Health Department, gave a speech noting the significance of Head Start programs for the community, including research showing that children enrolled in Early Head Start programs have better social-emotional language and cognitive development.\n\"All babies and toddlers need positive early learning experiences to foster their intellectual, social and emotional development and to lay the foundation for later school success,\" Maguire said. \"Talbot County Health Department's Early Head Start program offers daily, year-round services to families and young children in Talbot County. It provides a comprehensive array of services, including mental health, education, housing, referrals and linkages to health services.\"\nCommunity partners and members were given a tour of the center, where they were greeted by staff and children enjoying the care and benefits of the program.\nAfterward, people enjoyed refreshments and baked goods before heading to the next stop on the grant project tour, the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center Kitchen and Community Space.\nThis full restoration of a brick warehouse provides the resource center with a much-needed space for small groups, class opportunities and community gatherings.\nAdding a full commercial kitchen will allow small food businesses to expand their economic impact on the community and provide an appropriate space to create meals and food options for the community.\nTalbot County Councilmember Pete Lesher, vice president of the council, shared the council's enthusiasm and gratitude for the community space and renovations made by the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center.\n\"This is an organization that has an important mission to a growing part of our population in this community,\" Lesher said. \"Thanks to all of you who are already doing that. Thanks to the rest of you who have helped to make this project possible.\"\nAttendees were welcomed to a feast of Pakistani food created by Veronica Guevara, who used the kitchen to help launch her catering business. People enjoyed a delicious array of lentils, fresh strawberry salad, seasoned chicken and fluffy naan. Guevara explained each dish and showed the best way for attendees to eat it.\nMatthew Peters, director of Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, described this project as a \"labor of love.\"\n\"So we've got that whole new growth take, and all really thanks to having a little bit more space to breathe and to get people together like this provided to the community,\" Peters said. \"And hopefully, we keep finding more and more of our clients that are those secret gems so that I can create an amazing mission to share. So thank you all.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Local agencies need money from ENOUGH Act now\n\n July 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPHEN RIDEOUT | Section: Columns \n \n 607\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Governor's Office on Children recently released information about the ENOUGH Act that was passed in this most recent legislative session. The goals of this legislation are right in line with what communities need eventually to address child poverty and program needs in significant ways but place the achievement of those goals a long way off for many jurisdictions and in particular the jurisdictions that are in the greatest need.The implementation plans for communities and nonprofit organizations expect that there are organizations in our communities that have strong leadership, possibly an executive director, an engaged board of directors, strong community support with volunteers and funding. There is an expectation that they are ready to take on a new initiative even while they are stretched to support their existing programs and goals.\nAs I have been on the grants committee for the Mid Shore Community Foundation and on the board of another foundation that gives out over $250,000 a year to programs supporting women and children, I understand that there are some programs that are not funded for a variety of reasons or receive minimal support. We need to find a way to support these start up organizations now rather than have them wait, possibly for years, if ever, before they can make the grade to be funded by the ENOUGH Act.\nWhat the ENOUGH Act expects is that the money will go to those nonprofits that have their act together and meet all of the requirements that the Office on Children places on them. They are willing to help them develop and grow that capacity, but many of the groups doing great work in a community are small, understaffed and underfunded. As a result, they will take years, if ever, to become organized to be able to begin making a larger difference in their community for children and families.\nI have encouraged a different manner of funding programs for children and families that would bring a funding stream of smaller amounts to communities that have high poverty rates and need programs for summer and after school or reading for children to help communities right now with the significant needs that exist, especially in rural areas.\nThe funding would come directly to a city, town, or county based on existing data about the needs in that community. The local town or county council or Local Management Board would identify good programs that are underfunded but making a difference in their community and, with the help of the Governor's Office on Children, collect data that will show what the outcomes are from the money that is being spent.\nThe city, town or county or a Local Management Board could be the data collector for reporting purposes to the Governor's Office. Providing the funding, which would not have to be that much, could help to help the community identify and build the kind of nonprofit infrastructure that would be able to apply for and be funded as the larger and better funded programs will be supported by the ENOUGH Act.\nWithout funding to jump start communities that do not now have the resources to successfully apply for ENOUGH Act funding or can apply for funds to develop a collaboration, some communities that desperately need this help will never receive it, and we will see even more children continue down a path that will limit their ability to achieve in school and have successful lives.\nSending the funding to the city, town or county or the LMB based on need and existing data will help now not years in the future, and now is when it is needed.\nStephen Rideout is mayor of Cambridge.

A request from the county's public works department to award funds for that temporary relocation was made to Talbot County Council on Tuesday.The request was to award Bates Moving and Storage Company the moving and storage contract for just over $100,000. Council members voted unanimously in favor of the request.\n\"Bates has a lot of experience with moving library collections. They've done a number of libraries on the Eastern Shore as well as media centers,\" Dana Newman, director of Talbot County Free Library, said. \"And they have a special way of packing up library materials so that it's kept in order, and that it's stored in conditions that are okay for storing books over a long period of time.\"\nNewman said the collections will be moved to a temporary location in St. Michaels as renovations are completed. \"It does sound like a lot of funds needed for this, but it is a specialized process, if you can imagine trying to keep about 20,000-plus library materials in strict duodecimal order,\" Newman told the council.\nThe storage will last for around 15 months, during which they will not be available to be checked out. The move will begin around late October. Council members expressed support for the request.\n\"I'm excited that you're getting to the point that you're moving everything,\" Council Member Keasha Haythe said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In some ways, that fiscal pressure has increased since.Michael Sanderson, the executive director of the Maryland Association of Counties, briefed the Talbot County Council on those financial troubles and more during a special meeting Tuesday.\nHe told council members a budget shortfall of potentially $600 to $800 million could be facing lawmakers in Annapolis. Fixing that is \"not easy, but not impossible,\" he said.\n\"There are a couple of years of that in our forecast, and then it gets really serious,\" Sanderson said.\nWhen fiscal year 2028 arrives, Sanderson warned that the state will run out of money in its trust fund that's been used for The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's expansive and optimistic education initiative.\nMany counties have been under significant financial pressure due to state requirements stemming from Blueprint. Sanderson says the state will be feeling that level of pressure soon.\n\"The counties are feeling it now,\" he said. \"The state doesn't really feel it for a couple years down the road, and that has been a meaningful disconnect.\"\nWithout significant timeline adjustments for Blueprint from the state, MACo feels there will continue to be that disconnect between the fiscal situation of the state versus the situation counties are facing. State funding for transportation, though, is already causing serious impacts, Sanderson said.\n\"The canary in the coal mine that's already chirping is in transportation,\" he told the council members. \" \u2026 The conversation in the summer time is sometimes ambiguous and hazy and that sort of thing. But this year, not so much. They were just saying, 'If there aren't already shovels in the ground, we can't afford the next thing.'\"\nThe Maryland Department of Transportation has been forced to delay many statewide projects amid a significant budget deficit. Earlier this month, the department released a draft plan that showed $1.3 billion in cuts from the state's six-year transportation plan.\nSanderson noted the \"state's transportation challenge is not a function of the Key Bridge\" rebuild, which is set to begin next year.\nAt the county level, council Vice President Pete Lesher said Talbot County is \"finding itself in a slightly different place\" than others.\n\"We are going through a number of capital construction projects, our health department, our sheriff's office, our 911 center,\" Lesher said, emphasizing some of those projects are receiving \"pandemic-era related funds\" from the federal government.\n\"The pinch that a lot of counties are feeling right now, the income tax, is not yet being felt in Talbot County,\" Lesher said. \"We can look around at our neighbors and see what is coming, even though we are not yet in that position now.\"\nLesher thanked Sanderson and MACo President Johnny Olszewski Jr. for their work to represent the counties at the state level year-round.\n\"We know that we are stronger together in Annapolis,\" Lesher said. \"And we see every year what a powerful voice MACo is for all of us jointly.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ryan Anthony of the Cambridge Spy, Sharon Smith of the Cambridge Association of Neighborhoods, Jim Johnson of the Dorchester Star and Jim Brady of WHCP moderated the forum.\nWard 2 candidate Jenna LeCompte, Ward 4 candidate Dave Cannon, Ward 3 candidate Frank Stout and Ward 5 candidate Brian Roche \u2014 who is running uncontested \u2014 were not at the event.\nIn an email to WHCP on Friday, LeCompte said she is \"taking a step back\" from her campaign and would not be at the event. She did not respond to requests for clarification from the Star Democrat on what that means.\nMAYORAL FORUM\nSandwiched between two commissioner candidate sessions, the mayoral forum gave candidates Lajan Cephas, Andrew Bradshaw and La-Shon Banks-Foster the opportunity to share their perspectives on an array of Cambridge issues, from the waterfront, to revitalizing the city's downtown, to race relations.\nDuring the session, candidates were asked whether the city should get more involved in Dorchester County Public Schools, which is one of Maryland's lowest ranked school systems.\nBradshaw said he would like to implement a mentorship program, which would reach across racial and socioeconomic lines, and encourage the Board of Education to implement a charter school program. He said charter schools across the state tend to perform at the state average, which is \"significantly better\" than Dorchester schools.\n\"And they are only located in counties and jurisdictions with poor performance,\" he said, \"so there's corollaries where they can succeed in places like Cambridge.\"\nFoster, who attended the forum virtually, said every graduate from Dorchester County high schools is a county resident and could be a Cambridge resident.\n\"We cannot ignore the fact that whoever graduates from either of the schools that I mentioned can and will impact the City of Cambridge, and we must have an active role,\" she said.\nCephas said it is important for the city to be \"extremely supportive\" of the county, but there is no need to \"reinvent the wheel.\" She said there are nonprofits already in place to address education concerns.\n\"So it's extremely important that we understand what's already in place, support those nonprofits that are already in place, and each of us just pick up a book and read to someone,\" she said.\nCOMMISSIONER FORUMS\nThe seven commissioner candidates at the forum were split into two groups. All commissioner candidates were asked the same questions from the moderators.\nKicking off the event were Ward 1 candidates Brett Summers and Laurel Atkiss, as well as Ward 3 candidate Gary Gordy. Ward 2 candidates Jermaine Anderson, Shay Lewis-Sisco and Nancy Jackson, as well as Ward 4 candidate Sputty Cephas, closed out the event.\nWhen asked about code enforcement and overall housing quality in the city, Summers said hiring tenant advocates to promote a tenants bill of rights would be beneficial.\n\"Because if the tenants feel like they can contact the city inspector and have them come out without fear of getting evicted or some other kind of retribution, then the tenants are empowered to improve our housing stock,\" he said.\nAtkiss said the city has implemented a software system to make it easier to enforce things like building code violations. She said Cambridge is doing city-wide building inspections and recently hired a new code enforcement officer.\n\"We've invested money, we've invested time,\" she said, \"and now we're going to invest the manpower, and we're going to start to see some results that I hope everybody's going to be really happy with.\"\nLewis-Sisco said code enforcement should strategically target houses where renters are living in deplorable conditions. She said community engagement should also be a focus.\n\"So that when code enforcement officers go out to a homeowner or a property, they are able to offer those additional supports or let them know what additional resources exist,\" she said.\nThe issue of addressing crime in Cambridge was also brought up during the forum.\nGordy said improved lighting, more cameras and more monitoring of those cameras are needed in the city's \"hot spots\" in order to lower crime rates. When talking about monitoring cameras, he brought up a shooting that occurred over the weekend.\n\"Because last night police got there so fast, but they couldn't see who it was,\" he said about the need for 24-hour camera monitoring.\nJackson said addressing the issue of crime in Cambridge might start with more than detaining people. She said she would work to help resolve those problems if elected.\n\"There is something deep where this person is committing these acts,\" she said. \"It could be the home life or it could be the environment.\"\nCephas said strengthening the police department's community policing division is important. He talked about programming for youth to attract \"local and diverse talent\" as another solution.\n\"Let's do a cadet program to get some of these young people before they get out into the community and do wrong things or bad things,\" he said.\nAnderson said these problems have existed for a long time and won't be a quick fix. He stressed the importance of being proactive and communicating.\nWhen asked about the greatest threat to the city, both Atkiss and Anderson talked about the city standing in it's own way.\n\"But the biggest opportunity is imagine if we get out of our own way,\" Anderson said. \"Think about the opportunity that would pose for this city ... how much of a difference that would make.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline Commissioners hear from county workers, discuss school budget\n\n November 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 599\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 The Caroline County Commissioners convened on Tuesday and several topics were discussed, including the Employee Advisory Board's desire to attract and retain workers, approving changes to the fiscal year 2024 Caroline Board of Education budget and a restructuring of the Department of Public Works.BOARD OF EDUCATION BUDGETDerek Simmons, superintendent of Caroline County Public Schools, and Jill Hignutt, CFO of The Caroline Board of Education, requested amendments to the Board of Education's 2024 budget.\n\"We are here to share where the budget adjustments needed to take place in the operating budget and align those with the actuals at the end of the fiscal year,\" Simmons said.\nHignett gave the commissioners a copy of her short presentation, then began detailing the request.\n\"Starting with prescriptive revenues, there is a change of $6,389,071 related to our grant funding. Many of our grants cross fiscal years, so we must adjust the revenues to match the expenditures that were actually seen at year end,\" Hignutt said.\nThen she shifted the attention to expenditures like driver salaries for transportation. Between fuel costs and bus driver salaries, the school system overspent about $39,000. She also mentioned parking lot repavement projects and classroom renovations.\nThere was a $5,782,498 surplus noted in the total budgeted revenues. According to Daniel Fox, deputy county administrator, the excess of revenue over expenditures is retained by the Board of Education to go to its fund balance.\nThe commissioners approved the amended budget.\nEMPLOYEE ADVISORY BOARDNext up was the Employee Advisory Board, an authority that overlooks the corrections, emergency services, planning and codes, public works, recreation and parks, and administration departments. There is also a non-voting member department, the Department of Human Resources.\nTodd Lord, chairman of the Advisory Board for Caroline County, thanked the commissioners for improving pensions for retirees and achieving competitive pay increases to help with recruitment and retention.\nThe board also wants cost of living adjustments due to the inflation following the pandemic.\nLord proposed an initiative to go forward as he hears from staff about pay and salaries.\n\"We recommend merit pay increases annually for step based off of employee evaluations. We want to get away from the bunching of salaries. Health care plans for retirees, that is another one of our initiatives being discussed heavily in departments,\" Lord said.\nHe said the goal was to increase retention and have attraction for the employees under the board's care.\n\"Right now we want to provide a health care plan that employees can take into retirement,\" Lord said. \"Having their pension in retirement would be a huge benefit in retention for our staff.\"\nCommissioner Frank Bartz responded, \"Health care for retirees, that is a hard undertaking for the county.\"\nAnother commissioner said the same.\nPorter said, \"I don't foresee that we are going to be able to do health care benefits for people who are retiring at 55. The same inflation figures that you are using, we are facing as well.\"\nPresident Travis Breeding said, \"We have to find that balance \u2014 taking care of our employees and taking care of our tax payers and the constituents of the county.\"\nPUBLIC WORKS REORGANIZATIONRobin Eaton, director of the Department of Public Works, asked the commissioners for the authority to reorganize the department to create a project manager position. He spoke of maintaining the 80 miles of dirt roads in the county.\n\"Our original structure had three crew leaders, so doing away with one of those crew leader positions and creating a project inspector slash utility locator,\" Eaton said.\n\"It is actually three crews. Two under crew leaders and one dirt road crew with four employees under the road superintendent,\" Kathleen Freeman, county administrator, said.\nThe commissioners approved the reorganization. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Legislators talk state budget before heading back to Annapolis in January\n\n December 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 557\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 The state of the state's budget took up a large part of the conversation at a Dorchester Chamber of Commerce luncheon with state legislators on Dec. 4.The Lower Shore delegation answered questions from chamber members regarding concerns about Maryland's fiscal health, with a looming $2.7 billion state budget deficit predicted in fiscal year 2026.\n\"The reality is that if you continue to do the things that have gotten us into this deficit, it's only going to take us back there again,\" Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said. \"There needs to be a structural, fundamental change.\"\nMautz and Dels. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico), Chris Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) all spoke at the chamber lunch. They, along with the rest of the state's legislators, will head back to Annapolis in January for the 447th session of the Maryland General Assembly.\nIn talking about the state's budget, Mautz also said there should be incentives in place to try to drive state agencies to save money.\nSample-Hughes said the state should do its fiscal homework and find out what it \"really (has) to work with.\"\n\"But I do believe that we can still address and attack some of these goals that we have, whether it's education, whether it's climate, whether it's criminal justice,\" she said. \"We can do it in a pragmatic way.\"\nAdams said to solve the budget problem, the state has to leverage and grow its private sector.\n\"You do not do what we've done for the past two years,\" he said. He said the state and its leadership need to stop spending so much, own up to the problem and stop blaming it on COVID-19.\nHutchinson expressed his concerns with the transportation budget and the lack of funding for many infrastructure projects across the state.\n\"We've got to pay attention to our transportation budget,\" he said.\nBLUEPRINTThe legislators also talked about the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state through increasing education funding by $3.8 billion over a 10-year period.\nSample-Hughes said although Blueprint's goals are important, the General Assembly's decision to pass the plan has contributed to the state's budget deficit. She later advocated for giving more resources to the nonprofits that already serve 3 and 4 year olds, rather than putting money toward expanding early childhood education in the state's public school systems.\nMautz said he thinks the project needs to be paused so that the plan's strengths and weaknesses can be better evaluated.\nJUVENILE CRIMEThe legislators also talked about the state of juvenile crime in Maryland, with Sample-Hughes calling for the removal of Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi.\nHutchinson said that with recent juvenile justice reforms going into effect Nov. 1, he doesn't think a lot of legislators are going to want to discuss juvenile crime this upcoming session.\n\"Because they'll say, 'We just put that in place. We haven't even been able to see the results,'\" he said.\nAdams said law enforcement is needed now more than ever and officers need to be able to do their jobs.\n\"If you want a society, if you want a City of Cambridge, if you want an Eastern Shore (or) State of Maryland, if you want a United States that is civil, there have to be consequences,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If passed at a future meeting, they will approve a combined $1.5 million in funding for three projects: new auditorium lights at Easton High School ($817,321), light replacements at St. Michaels Middle High School ($556,000) and athletic field improvements across the district ($116,679).\nThe fiscal year 2025 budget already accounted for the capital costs, County Manager Clay Stamp noted. The three bills would simply authorize the usage of funds for those three projects, respectively.\nTalbot County Public Schools Director of Operations Kevin Shafer said Easton High's auditorium lights date back to the school's renovation in 1997.\nTalbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher said he's noticed \"how desperately needed this lighting system is.\"\n\"In order to put on some of the really quality student productions that we've seen at Easton High School, I believe that some of the lighting directors have been bringing equipment in from \u2026 the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and other places to supplement the antiquated equipment that the auditorium itself has,\" Lesher said.\n\"We've moved into an era of LED lighting, which didn't exist back in 1997,\" Lesher added. \"This is going to be a huge leap forward.\"\nShafer said the light replacements and improvements at St. Michaels Middle High School will complete the ongoing LED conversion product across the entire St. Michaels campus. Grant funding allowed for new side lights at St. Michaels Elementary, Shafer said.\nThe $117,000 for athletic field improvements will help the district move forward with its grass field upgrades.\n\"Generally speaking, the athletic field improvements are going to be surrounding the current fields that we have, grass fields,\" Shafer said. \"(We are) doing some longstanding improvements related to some issues or concerns that came up.\"\nA public hearing on the three bills will be held during Talbot County Council's Feb. 11 meeting at 5:30 p.m. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He highlighted two proposed bills that the county commissioners are concerned about.\nSenate Bill 0189 prohibits counties and the state from taking preserved farm or conservation land via eminent domain and Senate Bill 0724 would mandate seatbelts on all school buses.\nSCHOOL BUS SEATBELTSThis isn't the first time seatbelt requirements on school busses has been proposed in the General Assembly. Similar bills have been filed for many years and have not passed, with counties largely complaining about the cost of implementation.\nThis year's bill would mandate that every school bus made, brought or built after 2027 must have a seatbelt installed on every seat.\nThe county commissioners said they would have a conversation with Caroline County Public Schools about the bill, but they expressed concerns about the potential cost of enacting it.\n\"I don't think I'm interested in testifying,\" Larry Porter said about a request he received to oppose the legislation. \"But I think we could probably reach out to the superintendent because there were some concerns from their transportation department about it.\"\nThe concerns for the County Commissioners have been the same every time this measure has been proposed \u2014 the cost of installing seat belts on every school bus, who is liable if the kids don't put seatbelts on and how the school bus drivers will enforce seatbelt wearing.\n\"We have the same concerns that we had before,\" Porter said at the Tuesday meeting.\nIn an interview, Commission President Travis Breeding mentioned but he believes the design of the seats on the bus helps keep students safe without seatbelts.\nEMINENT DOMAINThe county is more receptive to eminent domain bill, but they want to see some revisions before it's passed.\n\"The eminent domain bill was prohibiting the state or county from taking land by eminent domain in areas that were preservation areas,\" Porter said. \"In the beginning, that sounds like that's something we would absolutely support.\"\nThe county recently had a situation at Long Swamp Bridge that made the commissioners feel revisions needed to be made to the measure. The county needed more space for the construction of a new bridge at the site, and it brought some preserved land from a owner to make more space.\nIf the eminent domain bill was enacted it would have been way more trouble for the county to go through that process of buying the land, Breeding said. It could have caused a lane closure.\n\"We didn't use eminent domain, but because (of) the landowner. It was in preservation land, and he negotiated,\" Breeding said.\nThey commissioners suggest maybe revising the bill to make it easier to work out future land preservation problems. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was one of many vendors who had previously attended the event not to distribute resources, but to receive them.\n\"It's really refreshing to be able to give back,\" Jefferson said. \"Just a couple years ago, I was somebody that was coming through the doors and receiving services myself, so it's good to see that we can help families in need.\"\nThe Caroline Cares Community Resource Day featured around 40 vendors providing information, help and food to the community.\n\"This is what it's all about,\" said Stephanie Johnson, His Hope Ministries' executive director and board member for Resources Day. \"Just getting all the resources in one building so that it can be kind of an easily accessible for those who need them the most. Being able to bring those providers under one roof, on a specific day, to get those services out to everybody who needs them is huge.\"\nOne of the main focuses for Resource Day is providing many different types of help for many different people.\nSome attendees face expenses they can't afford or are just in a bad financial situation, and some people are homeless. Resources Day helped with a variety of situations.\nDirectors expect 100 to 150 county residents experiencing homelessness to attend Resources Day every year, and they have a plan to make sure homeless residents can find shelter.\n\"With this particular event, they have access to walk around, talk to the vendors and see what exactly what their services are that they provide,\" Johnson said. \"However, like when it comes to those who are actually experiencing homelessness, we have a separate room set aside for them to really dig into what their needs are and see how we can connect them with services.\"\nCaroline County Public Schools officials attended, providing information for children on enrollment in school and many different resources for mental and physical health. United4Caroline provided free diapers for families with infants.\nChesapeake College's nursing program provided free blood pressure checks for all people in attendance. Nursing students gained experience and enjoyed serving the community.\n\"Oh, I love this, and I'm actually from Denton myself, so to give back to the community is amazing,\" Katie Reuwer, an assistant professor at Chesapeake College, said. \"It's a great experience for the students to really learn about community service and helping others. I've already had some really good feedback from the students about how much they enjoy it.\"\nStaff from Studio 107 Hair Salon in Kent Island and Edwards All Star Barbershop in Denton enjoyed providing free haircuts and styles at Resource Day, something both shops provide every year.\n\"There's no better feeling,\" Lisa Milligan, owner of Studio 107, said. \"You're helping people that are maybe down on their luck or they're just getting out of jail or they're just going for jobs. It's every aspect, older people that can't afford to get their hair cut especially in this economy. So it's great to give back.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Sen. Van Hollen talks federal grants pause with Eastern Shore legislators\n\n February 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 758\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n While speaking with Eastern Shore legislators Friday morning, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said a short-lived pause of federal funding earlier this week had impacts on local organizations such as fire stations and law enforcement agencies.Monday, President Donald Trump's budget office issued a memorandum ordering a pause on federal grants and loans. A U.S. district judge temporarily blocked the pause Tuesday before the White House rescinded the memo the following day.\n\"Because of the public outcry, they did pull back on this overall freeze,\" Van Hollen said. \"But there's still a whole lot of uncertainty and confusion. So if you are hearing from folks on the Eastern Shore that are recipients of federal programs that are being disrupted, please let us know.\"\nAt the weekly Eastern Shore Delegation meeting, Del. Steven Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) asked Van Hollen to elaborate on his perspective of what happened.\nVan Hollen said the memo from the Office of Management and Budget brought forth confusion for government agencies. The senator heard from thousands that were impacted, he said in an email newsletter.\n\"It was very broadly worded and very ambiguous,\" Van Hollen said. \"Federal agencies interpreted this based on what it said. Essentially, they did freeze a lot of ongoing payments to organizations that do important community work.\"\nArentz said some of the spending that was paused could be viewed as \"questionable\" in the first place.\n\"I think that's the point that was being made about that,\" Arentz said. \"I keep getting questions on it, because it does look like when you portray it in one way, it looks bad, but in the other way, you look at some spending that people would have questions on. And I think that's part of the explanation I try to give.\"\n\"The way the memo was worded and the reason it was retracted was because it was so broad that it appeared to impact everybody,\" Van Hollen responded.\nSen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) also attended Friday's Eastern Shore Delegation meeting. She explained to state senators and delegates her line of thinking when voting to confirm recent political appointees, emphasizing that she is prepared to vote on \"qualified\" candidates across party lines.\n\"My primary interest and sole interest, really, is making sure that I protect the interests of Maryland,\" Alsobrooks said.\nSUPERINTENDENTSEastern Shore superintendents gathered at the meeting Friday to provide legislative requests and recommendations.\nCaroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons, president of the Eastern Shore of Maryland Educational Consortium superintendents' group, framed Friday's discussion around The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education funding initiative.\nIt comes as Gov. Wes Moore (D) and the state legislature attempt to balance a $3 billion state deficit, in part by making cuts to education funding.\nDorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson explained the importance for districts to attract a diverse and qualified teacher workforce. However, state requirements, such as teacher salary minimums, sometimes bring about challenges.\n\"It is not good for a district, especially like mine, since we don't have the funding that other districts have,\" Thompson said.\nQueen Anne's County Public Schools Superintendent Patty Saelens said the Eastern Shore superintendents don't support Moore's proposed funding cuts to teacher collaborative time (out-of-classroom time to grade and plan) and community school initiatives.\n\"Our number one priority right now that we just can't support is literal cuts to our budget, specifically as it relates to the collaborative time and the community schools,\" Saelens said. \"Those are two major things that will negatively impact our overall state support.\"\nEDUCATIONRepresentatives from colleges and universities attended Friday's meeting, including Chesapeake College President Clifford Coppersmith and Washington College President Mike Sosulski.\nSosulski provided an update on Washington College's Innovation Plant Project, which is a project the institution is collaborating with Chesapeake College on.\n\"In the year-and-a-half of its development, it's already garnered $3 million in public and private funding to support it,\" Sosulski said.\nSosulski added that he hopes the Maryland Sellinger Grant Program, which provides independent colleges and universities with state funding, isn't slashed.\n\"I can't tell you how important Sellinger has been to making a Washington College education affordable and accessible to all Maryland residents,\" he said. \"It is really, and quite literally, the difference for many, many of our students and their ability to achieve the kind of education that we can provide.\"\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) asked about whether universities are considering raising tuition due to potential state funding cuts.\n\"We fully understand the need for the governor to cut the budget,\" said University of Maryland Eastern Shore President Heidi Anderson. \"We will not be looking at increasing tuition for our students, and we will abide by that.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From crushes to banning cell phones \u2014 Maryland lawmakers propose new legislation covering range of issues\n\n February 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 654\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Maryland state senators and delegates have introduced a variety of bills in the 2024 legislative session, addressing issues ranging from state symbols and education mandates to law enforcement policy and budget concerns.State Symbols and Utility RegulationsState Sen. Steve Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) has introduced Senate Bill 562, which would designate the original Maryland Orange Crush as the state cocktail. The bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Wicomico, Worcester).\nHershey also sponsored Senate Bill 561, which, along with House Bill 227 sponsored by Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), would allow electric cooperatives to use unclaimed funds only to assist cooperative members or donate to nonprofit organizations, rather than treating them as abandoned property.\nAdditionally, Hershey introduced Senate Bill 355, seeking to delay the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program by two years.\nEnergy and Education LegislationDel. Jeff Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) is behind two bills on solar energy regulation: House Bill 739 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 478) and House Bill 742. One bill would prohibit the use of eminent domain for solar siting, while the other would return control over solar development to county governments.\nGhrist also introduced House Bill 736, which seeks to remove the mandate requiring local school systems to offer pre-kindergarten for three-year-olds. Another provision in the bill would increase state funding to help Kent County construct a new middle school.\nOn law enforcement, Ghrist is supporting a bill \u2014 potentially House Bill 122 \u2014 that would require the removal of unfounded complaints from police personnel files.\nNursing, Historic Preservation, and Cemetery ProtectionsDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) has proposed House Bill 602 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 407), directing the State Board of Nursing to negotiate reciprocity agreements with neighboring states for advanced practice nursing licensure. Another measure, House Bill 616 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 421), would extend the statute of limitations for crimes related to cemetery destruction and prohibit damaging cemetery landscaping. The bill is co-sponsored by Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico).\nHutchinson is also behind House Bill 760, which would establish a local appeals process for Maryland Historic Trust decisions.\nBudget Deficit Shifts to CountiesGov. Wes Moore's proposed budget shifts some of the state's structural deficit onto county governments. Ghrist criticized the move, stating that counties did not contribute to the deficit but are now being forced to compensate for state overspending.\n\"For my district, $720,000 will be shifted to Caroline County on top of an additional $1.8 million more that the county will have to add to education under Kirwan mandates,\" Ghrist stated. He cited similar financial burdens for other Eastern Shore counties, including Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne's.\n\"This will stifle economic growth because people will be sending more of their hard-earned money to the government rather than spending it in their local economies,\" Ghrist added.\nLaw Enforcement and Traffic StopsA controversial proposal, Senate Bill 292, has drawn strong opposition from law enforcement officials, including Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker. The bill would reclassify certain primary traffic offenses as secondary offenses, preventing law enforcement from stopping drivers solely for those violations.\n\"These minor traffic violations could actually lead to catching suspects that have committed serious felonies, recovering firearms, and stopping drug-related crimes,\" Baker said. A hearing on the bill is scheduled before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee.\nOther Bills of Local InterestHouse Bill 28, sponsored by Del. Josh Bouchat (R-Carroll, Frederick), proposes a constitutional amendment requiring all Maryland counties to adopt a charter government structure.\nHouse Bill 278, also from Bouchat, would provide an income tax subtraction modification for enhanced agricultural management equipment to support sustainable farming practices.\nHouse Bill 192, introduced by Del. Nino Mangione (R-Baltimore County), aims to curb student cell phone use in schools under the proposed \"No Distracted Learning Act.\"\nAs these bills move through the legislature, local officials and residents will have the opportunity to voice their support or concerns during committee hearings and public forums. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After having battled another large snowfall just a month prior, road crews and first responders were prepared.\nCaroline, Talbot and Dorchester counties responded to the snow fast and were able to clear roads in a timely manner, allowing many government offices to open Wednesday.\n\"Our Public Works team was ready for the winter weather that hit Tuesday afternoon,\" Kathleen Freeman, Caroline County administrator, said. \"Crews came in at 4 p.m., and with the rising temperatures, they quickly cleared the roads and made sure all county buildings were accessible.\"\n\"By 10 a.m. Wednesday, everything was set for a delayed start,\" she said. \"I want to thank our road crews and all essential staff for their hard work in making this event go as smoothly as possible. Their quick response kept everything running with minimal disruption for our community.\"\nCaroline County opened their offices at 10 a.m. Wednesday morning, as did Talbot County and the towns of Easton and Denton.\nTalbot County could not be reached for comment, but the county decided to open up their offices at 10 a.m. Wednesday morning.\nDorchester County's offices were open during regular business hours Wednesday, though non-essential employees were given the option to work from home if they could, according to a Facebook post from the county government.\n\"We had a great night. Snow slacked up earlier than expected. It was great experience,\" Dorchester County Manager Jerry Jones said. \"Folks stayed off the road. It was good Mother Nature is helping us. The window was bigger (than with the last snow) to get everything. Emergency responders were great as well.\"\nSchools decided to keep campuses closed Wednesday because of the snowfall, but several districts had students attend class virtually.\nTalbot County Public Schools conducted its first virtual learning day since 2020, and district officials were pleased with the results, according to TCPS Directer of Communications Debbie Gardner.\n\"The feedback from school principals has been positive,\" Gardner said Wednesday afternoon. \"Student attendance has been better than we anticipated, and our teachers have done a fantastic job.\"\nDorchester County Public Schools conducted a virtual learning day as well, but could not be reached for comment.\nCaroline County Public Schools did not have students attend class virtually, but the district plans to open on time Thursday. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We just don't know how this is going to unfold.\"\nCounty staff has been going through the operating and capital budgets line by line to find efficiencies, Jones said.\n\"We are constantly working on solutions,\" he said. \"We're finding those efficiencies. We have made substantial changes already.\"\nDuring the work session, Jones detailed estimated revenue and expenditures for fiscal year 2026. According to Jones' presentation, preliminary projections for the budget show a deficit of $6.2 million, with $87.7 million in estimated revenue and $93.9 million in estimated expenditures.\nJones outlined a list of mandates from the state that contribute to the county's deficit. These include reductions in grant funding, losses from proposed property tax deductions, an increase in state education maintenance of effort costs and increased financial responsibilities for things like teacher retirement.\nBoth Jones and County Council members said the budget would look a lot different without these mandates. Jones said that without the mandates, the county would not be facing a deficit. He said he county would instead have had $200,812 more in revenue than expenditures.\nThe council and county manager also talked about significant budget cuts made two years ago. Council Vice President Mike Detmer said the fat had already been trimmed from the budget at that time.\n\"At this point, we're trying to keep the ship from sinking,\" he said.\nCouncil President Lenny Pfeffer said he and Detmer have plans to go to Annapolis to testify in front of the Maryland General Assembly on legislation that would negatively affect the county's budget.\nEDUCATION FUNDING\nDetmer said the decrease in state funding and increase in the county's fiscal responsibility is largely driven by the state's goal to meet its financial obligation to the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a state plan that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education.\nDorchester County Public Schools, which has its own budget separate from the county, also is facing a deficit. The deficit, which was estimated to be $10.19 million in January, is now estimated to be $5.59 million.\nDuring a Dorchester County Board of Education budget work session also held Thursday, Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson shared refinements the district has made to the budget since the board's work session in January.\nHe said the $4.6 million in additional cuts to to reduce the deficit were made through reductions to alternative education programming, supplies costs, travel costs, contracted services and fixed charges as well as expanding the district's understanding of Blueprint guidance to better match funding with expenses.\n\"We are taking it serious, and we are trying to make the changes we can to reduce our budget in a smart way,\" Thompson said.\nAt the County Council work session, council member Ricky Travers said other counties are having the same budget problems.\n\"Rural Maryland is the worst right now because the bigger counties, you just add another zero to it, but they've got a little bit more ability to garnish more money per penny (on taxes),\" he said. \"But this big number is astronomical.\"\nJones said the county will play it by ear on when it holds its next budget work session. He said when it is held will be announced to the public. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

County officials say they've heard for years about the need for new lights.\nThe project will cost $817,000, just over half of a total $1.5 million to be pulled from the county's capital projects fund. Talbot County's fiscal year 2025 budget has already accounted for the costs.\n\"That's huge for the auditorium,\" County Council President Chuck Callahan said. \"So I'm glad that went through. That's going to be big for the school.\"\nCouncil members also unanimously approved $556,000 for light replacements at St. Michaels Middle High School and $116,000 for athletic field improvements across the district.\nFollowing those approvals, the County Council passed a bill permitting the county's sale of bonds to borrow $26.9 million for Chapel District Elementary School renovations. That funding from the county spans both fiscal years 2025 and 2026.\nThe renovation project, which broke ground last August, will upgrade the existing building and add on an additional 16,000 square feet. Chapel Elementary was last renovated in 1994.\nCallahan said Talbot County Public Schools Director of Operations Kevin Shafer has done a \"phenomenal job\" leading renovation efforts.\n\"You've done excellent keeping us up to speed and everything, and trying to keep everything on budget,\" Callahan said. \"We really, really appreciate it.

    "content": "Talbot County provides first look at draft budget for FY26\n\n March 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 474\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Talbot County Manager Clay Stamp said one aspect was clear when drafting the county's fiscal year 2026 budget: it needed to remain flat.Speaking with the Talbot County Council at a workshop Tuesday, county employees presented a balanced draft budget coming in at $163.3 million. It comes in slightly below last year's budget of $163.8 million.\nThe county's total budget has ballooned in recent years. In fiscal year 2023, it was $112 million, and one year later, it rose to $128 million. It took a sharper jump to the $163 million mark last year.\nStamp said the increases were for good cause. \"You've made incredible and important investments in public safety and education,\" he told council members.\nBut Stamp emphasized that given federal uncertainties, state cost shifts and recurring county costs, it is important to curb that recent upward trend.\n\"That was a mandate as we put this budget together,\" Stamp said of the belt-tightening.\nStamp said the draft fiscal year 2026 budget currently proposes no additional job positions. The county's capital improvement plan is also trimmed back, he said. He hopes the county can focus on finishing projects already underway, such as Chapel District Elementary School renovations and a new EMS station in Cordova.\nWhen drafting the budget, Stamp and Finance Director Martha Sparks said they initially came in $6 million over their target. To remedy that, they're proposing delayed payments for postemployment benefits and correctional officers' retirements, respectively \u2014 the latter of which is to be expected to be included in fiscal year 2027.\nSparks mentioned that tax hikes proposed at the state level for wealthy individuals may have an impact on Talbot County revenues. Sparks said last time a similar tax increase was levied in 2009, it made a significant dent, partly due to the recession.\n\"We had an exodus of the wealthy in our county as a result of that,\" Sparks said. \"And it took us approximately 10 years to recover.\"\nSparks added, however, that the county looks OK for fiscal year 2026 in terms of those tax proposals. She said she's \"not sure what that will look like for us moving forward.\"\nAs for policy and funding shifts at the federal level, Stamp said \"it's reasonable\" to expect impacts will trickle down to Talbot County.\n\"We are cognizant of that,\" Stamp said. \"Radars are up, antennas are up. We're watching closely.\"\nThe draft budget shows $55 million in funding for the Talbot Board of Education. Stamp said the county must contribute that mark since it's required by state funding formulas. Any additional education funding is left for the County Council to consider in the coming weeks.\nCouncil members and staff will hold a number of workshops this month and in April before a budget proposal is officially introduced April 15.\nPublic budget hearings are scheduled for May 6, and the County Council is expected to enact a budget ordinance May 27. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Counties approve Chesapeake College budget request, shift cost of tech center\n\n April 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 526\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS \u2014 In a joint meeting Thursday, officials across Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties approved a shift in county cost shares for Chesapeake College's new technical building.During the meeting, which was held at the college's main campus in Queen Anne's County, the five counties approved a total $9.02 million budget request made by the college for fiscal year 2026. The school's budget is $1.31 million higher than its fiscal year 2025 budget.\nPart of the $9.02 million budget request included a $952,560 request for the design of a new technical building. Chesapeake College Vice President for Administrative Services Karen Smith said the new building will have areas for a variety of programs, including agriculture, electrical, welding and fabrication, construction trades and advanced manufacturing. She said the cost for the design phase could be lower depending on state approval.\nAlthough the five counties approved the request for funding for the design, the decision came with a shift in contributions toward the project.\nDorchester County's share of costs for the design phase will be taken on by Queen Anne's County. This means Queen Anne's County's responsibility for the project will jump from 28.9%, or an estimated $275,290, to 47.8%, or an estimated $455,324.\nDuring the meeting, Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer and Vice President Mike Detmer outlined their council's concerns regarding paying for the project.\nAlthough other counties hope to use the new technical building for career and technical education at the high school level, Dorchester County has a career and technology center it is still paying off, they said.\nThrough its budget process, Dorchester County has struggled to eliminate an estimated $6.2 million deficit.\nPfeffer said Dorchester County takes in about $45 million in property and income taxes and will have to give Dorchester County Public Schools $26.6 million for fiscal year 2026.\n\"So we're trying to run the rest of the county on half of that,\" he said. \"So while in conceptual context, we believe in the project, fiscally our citizens and our staff are saying we don't know how we're going to be able to participate.\"\nAt the Chesapeake College meeting, Queen Anne's County Commissioner Jack Wilson Jr. shared his county's decision to cover Dorchester County for the project design costs.\n\"We all know what happens if we let this money go back to the state,\" Wilson said. \"It's going to go somewhere else in this state, and it's not going to be here. We got this far. And Lenny, listen, I feel for you guys. I know what you're going through. But I think we just need to keep it on the rails at least through the design phase and see what the state's going to help with.\"\nAccording to documents from the meeting, the state will support 75% of project costs, and the counties will support the remaining 25%.\nAfter the counties voted to approve the amended capital budget, Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian said he understands the position Dorchester County is in, mentioning the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and \"unfunded mandates\" by the state.\n\"I think we all understand any one of us could be in your same position very easily,\" Fithian told the Dorchester County Council members. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Seventy kids aged 3 to 10 participated in the egg hunt, which Caroline County has been hosting the past 10 years.\n\"We love this. This is what we do it for,\" Davis said about having kids out for the event.\nWhile traditional Easter egg hunts take place in the daylight, the Caroline County event has an added obstacle for egg hunters \u2014 darkness. The annual hunt takes place at dusk, and children use flashlights to help locate eggs on the elementary school's lawn.\nEach age group had a special egg to look for. For ages 3 and 4, it was a soccer egg. For ages 5 to 7, it was a camouflage egg, and for ages 8 to 10, it was a football egg.\nEach group had a separate time slot to capture the most eggs they could and go after the special egg. When a child found the special egg, they received a special prize, an Easter basket.\nThe event is fun for the children, but Parks and Recreation employees have fun as well.\n\"I found different patches of taller grass, leaves, branches and twigs,\" Parks and Recreations employee Liam Wallace said about hiding the eggs. \"I kind of just hid it within those.\"\n\"It was just crazy. I wanted to see how happy they were out here, no elbows, no shoving, so safe fun,\" Halie Readores, another employee, said.\nLynn Zepp, a mother of two, brought her son, Weston, and daughter, Willow, to the egg hunt for their first year of participation.\n\"It was exciting,\" Lynn Zepp said. \"We just got done with a baseball game, and we rushed over here because we wanted to try out the flashlight egg hunt.\"\nWhen Weston and Willow were asked if they enjoyed the event, they said they had fun. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County makes its way through grueling budget process\n\n April 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Over the past four months, an atmosphere of concern, frustration and, at times, despair has colored budget meetings in Dorchester County.In mid-April, the Dorchester County Council introduced a $91.96 million proposed operating budget for fiscal year 2026 with proposals to increase taxes. The introduction came after months of work by county staff to eliminate an estimated $6.2 million deficit.\nAt the same time, Dorchester County Public Schools has been working to eliminate a multi-million dollar deficit of its own. At an April budget work session, DCPS Superintendent Jymil Thompson said the district is still $5.59 million in the hole. The district hopes to eliminate the deficit by the Board of Education's May meeting.\nTo balance and pass these budgets, difficult decisions \u2014 like the school district canceling summer school for 2025 and the county increasing 911 fees from $1.50 to $4.25 \u2014 have already been made.\n\"We hate to have to put any of this on the backs of our citizens, but these are state laws that are being passed down as a bandaid for us to pay,\" County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said in an interview with The Star Democrat. \"And unfortunately we're having to pass it down onto our citizens because we have no other revenue to pay these bills.\"\nWHAT MAKES FY26 DIFFERENT\nDorchester County's proposed operating budget is $10 million more than the fiscal year 2025 budget passed last May. County Manager Jerry Jones said the increases are in part due to new education requirements from the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education plan.\nJones said another reason the county has had to increase spending include cost shifts from the state to the county for things like teacher pensions.\nIn an effort to lessen budget costs, the county sought a waiver for the maintenance of effort for education, which is a law that requires counties to provide as much funding per pupil as was provided in the previous fiscal year. But with a narrow window between the state passing a budget and the waiver's due date, the county had to ask for an extension, which was denied.\n\"It's disappointing,\" Jones said. \"But at the end of the day, we've got to keep moving forward.\"\nThompson said Blueprint requirements, like increasing teacher starting salaries, are part of the reason why the school district's budget \u2014 which is separate from the county's \u2014 has been difficult to balance this year. He said inflation and recurring program costs have also hindered the process.\n\"No decision is easy,\" he said. \"But I think we're all trying to make the best decision for our students.\"\nBoth Jones and Thompson said they don't see the annual budget process getting easier any time soon. Jones said he doesn't see things getting easier unless change is made at the state level.\n\"I don't see (the budget) easing up in years to come unless some big changes are considered at the general assembly and future sessions,\" he said. \"We'll see how it plays out.\"\nTAX DIFFERENTIALS\nOne of the proposed changes to balance the county's budget is to remove the tax differential, or lower property tax rate, for Cambridge and Hurlock. This would mean Cambridge and Hurlock residents would have to pay the full property tax rate.\nCambridge Mayor Lajan Cephas said although the county is trying its best to balance the budget, she believes this measure is unfair to Cambridge residents. She said the tax differential essentially returns money to tax payers for \"duplicated\" services.\nCephas also said Cambridge is growing, which will increase the tax base and bring in more revenue for the county. She said the county should instead look into raising taxes in unincorporated areas that are \"a little bit better off.\"\nJones said he doesn't know what the final budget will look like, but said the council welcomes input.\n\"We want people to come forward and contribute to this conversation,\" he said.\nAdoption of Dorchester County's budget is slated for May 20. The county's first public budget hearing will be held May 6.\nThompson said the Dorchester County Board of Education has to pass the budget by the end of June, but he hopes the board will pass the budget in May to give staff time to make necessary preparations. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County OKs $161 million budget\n\n May 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 685\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Talbot County made good on its promise to deliver a flat, conservative budget for fiscal year 2026. The County Council unanimously passed a $161.1 million spending plan Tuesday.It comes in at nearly $3 million under last year's budget amid what County Manager Clay Stamp calls \"uncharted waters.\"\n\"The economic landscape out there is a bumpy ride right now,\" Stamp said. \"This year, we knew that we needed to flatten the budget out, we needed to live within our means.\"\nStamp and other officials have emphasized Talbot County's continued financial commitments toward public safety, whether through capital projects such as an EMS station in Cordova or support for correctional officers.\nIn a draft version of the budget that only received a few adjustments Tuesday, the council is expected to allocate the following funds for public safety:\n$11.5 million for emergency medical services.$10.5 million for the Talbot County Sheriff's Office.$7.6 million for the Department of Corrections.$5.4 million for emergency management.$3.3 million for volunteer fire departments.\nCouncil members thanked Stamp, Finance Director Martha Sparks and Assistant Finance Director Kaitlin Foster-Clark for their work during the budget process.\n\"This was the most challenging budget that I've ever sat through,\" council member Keasha Haythe said. \"The decisions were very hard on some items.\"\n\"It was definitely a heavy lift this year, but everyone bucked down, and we made it happen here,\" council member Dave Stepp said.\nThe county's property tax rate will remain largely steady at 79 cents per $100 of assessed value, though residents will see a supplemental tax of just over 1 cent per $100 of value on their tax bills.\nEDUCATION FUNDING\nThat supplement stems from education funding OK'd by the county. While most line items were ironed out through deliberations, workshops and meetings, Tuesday's discussion centered on funding amendments for Talbot County Public Schools.\nThe budget already included $55 million in education funding as required by The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's initiative to fund and improve education. County Council members were left to consider how much the county would contribute above that mark.\nIn a 4-1 vote Tuesday, the council approved an additional $600,000 in funding for schools, aimed at filling nine positions, including multilingual and special education roles. Council member Lynn Mielke was the sole no vote.\nThe approved budget change came after an amendment to fulfill the district's entire $1.1 million request \u2014 which had been scaled back from $5.5 million earlier this budget cycle \u2014 failed narrowly. Vice President Pete Lesher and Haythe favored the $1.1 million, but President Chuck Callahan, Stepp and Mielke did not.\nLesher argued it is \"short-sighted\" to not fund the full request. He said it'd be prudent for the county to gradually increase its education funding as even higher Blueprint projections loom in future fiscal years.\n\"This would be a small step in that direction,\" Lesher said. \"And frankly, it will make next year, an election year, a lot easier for all of us up here.\"\n\"I think we should be going farther,\" he said of the $600,000 mark. \"But this goes some distance.\"\nCallahan sponsored the amendment to partially OK the district's request, citing the significant need for teachers. The $500,000 not approved by the council was requested by the district to increase teacher and instructional assistant salaries.\n\"I would ask that the school board use the money that we give you for (hiring) teachers,\" Callahan said. \"I would like to see that, and not for something else.\"\nMielke said she was initially on board with Callahan's amendment. But she said she needs \"more security\" that the district will put the $600,000 toward the nine positions.\n\"I'm not advised that it necessarily would be,\" Mielke said. \"So for that reason I couldn't support it.\"\nA spokesperson for Talbot County Public Schools said in a statement to The Star Democrat that the district stands behind the $1.1 million request but understands the \"challenges faced by council and staff in meeting the funding needs of Talbot County in these uncertain times.\"\n\"We are grateful for their support for educators' pensions and for the additional staff needed to serve our students,\" the statement read.\nThis story has been updated to include a statement from Talbot County Public Schools. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County Council to submit five legislative initiatives\n\n June 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 379\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Dorchester County Council Members are planning to submit five recommendations for the Maryland Association of County's 2026 legislative initiatives.MACo will select four initiatives based on feedback and suggestions from Maryland's county jurisdictions and Baltimore City to prioritize during the state's General Assembly beginning in January.\nMACo's 2025 initiatives focused on local revenue structures, infrastructural funding, the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and clean energy. Dorchester County's recommendations for 2026 do not differ too much.\nThe Dorchester County Council's five recommendations are:\nTo consider a pause or suspension of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future education plan to allow counties to catch up financially.To rethink or review existing rules or policies that override local control over solar energy regulations.To improve infrastructure related to transportation and water drainage in Dorchester County.To introduce an initiative regarding safety concerns of solar battery storage and concerns regarding the sufficiency of the decommissioning bond that covers the cost of removing solar infrastructure once it's no longer in use.To continue to reform juvenile justice. This recommendation came after a 15-year-old resident shot and killed another resident in the 900 block of Cornelia Street on June 8.\nCounty Council Vice President Mike Detmer said juvenile justice laws need serious reformation to make Dorchester County a safer place.\n\"Whether you're below 18 or over 18, you have to get some feedback for your actions,\" Detmer said. \"Your terrible actions aren't in a vacuum; we all live here.\"\nThe purpose of MACo's recommended initiatives is to address problems counties are facing with state legislators. County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said the organization collects concerns and information from counties to assist them in navigating the legislative process at the General Assembly.\nDetmer said that these initiatives don't always align with Dorchester County due to the county's unique set of problems, and this misalignment has caused some tension with the state. \"You know, things are complicated,\" he said. \"I would say the tension really stems from the policies and laws that the state is enacting.\"\nElected officials from Maryland's 23 counties and Baltimore City can submit legislative proposal initiatives on behalf of the county as an elected body, generally at an open meeting or via a voting process, or not on behalf of the county, but as an individual.\nNominations can be submitted online through June 27 on the MACo website. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline commissioners weigh potential locations for new Lockerman Middle\n\n June 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 666\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 During the Caroline County Commissioners' open comment report Tuesday morning, Commissioners Vice President Larry Porter brought up the discussion on Lockerman Middle School's proposed locations.Porter said he preferred that the new middle school go on the North Caroline High School property, one of two locations being considered during the design processes for the building begin. The other location, near the county sheriff's office on Double Hills Road, presents several challenges, Porter said.\n\"I think at this point I would like to say that I am in favor of the North Carolina location as opposed to being built in town,\" Porter said.\nCommissioners Frank Bartz agreed with Porter and cited traffic and safety concerns on Route 404.\nThe commissioners also had discussions about the school's location at their meeting two weeks ago.\nAt that meeting, County Administrator Kathleen Freeman presented the two location options. Commissioners President Travis Breeding sparked a conversation about how much sway the commissioners have over the school's location.\n\"How much influence do the commissioners actually have over where the school gets constructed?\" Breeding asked two weeks ago. \"As part of the funding of this, other than a survey, we haven't really been consulted.\"\nBreeding then explained the issues they would run into with each potential location.\n\"From what I gather, it seemed like a lot of people really preferred the Double Hills location. But, with Double Hills, we've got to work out a ton of details with the Town of Denton as far as sewer, water allocation for that to work, potentially pump station upgrades,\" Breeding said.\nHe then mentioned traffic issues on Route 404 with beach traffic towards the end of the school year and students from northern county towns like Marydale, who would have to take the bus a long distance to the potential Double Hills location.\nPorter, said he didn't recall that \"the county did not have a lot of input\" on the design of new county buildings in the past.\nFreeman assured Breeding that the county will be involved with the full feasibility study for both sites to determine which site makes the most sense.\nBreeding also brought forward discussion of how much influence the commissioners will have for the design of the school.\n\"Then also, how much input do we have over the the design?\" Breeding asked. \"I mean, we don't want a situation where we're building something that's way more expensive than it needs to be or making it as functional as we can and keeping the cost as low as we can.\"\nBartz raised an issue where if the county has to build a new detention center, a school on the Double Hills Road site would cause a problem. The Caroline County Sheriff's Office is located near that Double Hills Road site, making the location logical for a detention center, he said.\nThe county is in talks with Queen Anne's County about a new 388-bed regional detention center that would house all Caroline, Queen Anne's and Kent county prisoners. After conversations about control and cost of the center, discussions between the three counties have slowed down.\nLockerman name\nPorter pointed out conversation that are being had about the Lockerman's name staying at the location of the current building instead of being attached to the new school.\nThough the existing building will no longer be used as a school when the new school is built, Porter said he was in favor of keeping the Lockerman name attached to the facility in the interest of honoring its history.\n\"I think it's going to be important that the history of the school and the name of Lockerman be retained,\" he said. \"I don't know what the future use is going to be for that building, but it's important, I think, from the alumni standpoint, from the community standpoint, that the history be be kept there for whatever use is going to be done in the future.\"\nBreeding suggested drafting a letter of intent to the Caroline County Board of Education stating that it would be the commissioners' intention to retain the name of the building. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hignutt and Simmons explained multiple numbers within their budget including increasing administrators salaries to become competitive with neighboring counties. The commissioners also discussed Lockerman Middle School and the potential new location. Simmons said the Board of Education will keep a close working relationship with the commissioners throughout the process.Lori Bishop and Charlotte Brown provided an update on the addition to 4-H Park. The addition is almost complete, but the bathrooms failed inspection due to sinks being too tall and toilets being to far from the wall.Daniel Fox discussed Opioid Settlement Fund with the county commissioners. The county received $358,000 in local direct payments and $515,000 in target aid grants for opioid settlement. The county plans to talk with other departments and agencies to see how the fund will properly assist on a one-time basis.The county conducted the second reading and public hearing for an emergency bill on wastewater treatment facilities.

The Planning Commission had a positive recommendation. The commissioners moved the discussion to a third reading at their next meeting.During the county administration report, Kathleen Freeman told the commissioners about a conversation she had with Robbie Gill about a new YMCA in Caroline County. The commissioners are adamant about getting a new YMCA in Caroline County and believe the conversations need to turn into building. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After the discussion the commissioners talked about Lockerman Middle School and the next steps.\n\"I think it'd be good for us to say that we are working together on the Lockerman Middle School construction,\" Commissioners President Travis Breeding said. \"We were asking questions about what role the commissioners officially play in siting and construction, they were just questions that we were asking. It wasn't like the Board of Ed's going to run all over us and make crazy stupid decisions and we're going to be stuck with it. It was just what influence do we have over the process.\"\nBreeding explained the consensus the commissioners have come to on their personal choice for the new school location.\n\"I think we talked about it, and our consensus is that the most logical place to put it is probably next to North Carolina High School for us,\" Breeding said. \"We understand that there's a whole process that has to be going through, fact finding, the Board of Ed will review that and make their decisions based off of that. But we were just saying that that questioning what influence we actually had over the process.\"\nSimmons clarified they understand the commissioners wanting understanding of their role and told the commissioners how the process will go.\n\"Board of Education selects the site,\" Simmons said. \"The feasibility study, which was presented to the board on July 1st, indicated North Caroline High School was the better of the two locations. We did review the two sites that we were asked to review that were basically the county-owned, which is cost efficient way to do it.\nSimmons said the board received the feasibility study that night and should be making its decision on a site at the August meeting. He added the site selection does not include picking what the design of the building will be.\nAfter looking over potential designs for the new Lockerman Middle School, Breeding suggested having athletic facilities have their own location and not sharing fields.\n\"One of the major things that stuck out with me was, relocating the athletic facilities around there,\" Breeding said. \"If we can get dedicated facilities so we're not sharing space like we have been doing forever, where lacrosse or soccer is using the outfield of the softball and the baseball field, if we can actually get dedicated space, that would be a priority of mine.\"\nHe noted that facilities in surrounding counties should be studied.\n\"We've got one bite at the apple here, let's get it right,\" Breeding said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From crushes to banning cell phones \u2014 Maryland lawmakers propose new legislation covering range of issues\n\n February 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 636\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2013 Maryland state senators and delegates have introduced a variety of bills in the 2024 legislative session, addressing issues ranging from state symbols and education mandates to law enforcement policy and budget concerns.State Symbols and Utility Regulations\nState Sen. Steve Hershey (R-36) has introduced Senate Bill 562, which would designate the original Maryland Orange Crush as the state cocktail. The bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Johnny Mautz (R-37) and Mary Beth Carozza (R-38).\nHershey also sponsored Senate Bill 561, which, along with House Bill 227 sponsored by Del. Chris Adams (R-37B), would allow electric cooperatives to use unclaimed funds only to assist cooperative members or donate to nonprofit organizations, rather than treating them as abandoned property.\nAdditionally, Hershey introduced Senate Bill 355, seeking to delay the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program by two years.\nEnergy and Education Legislation\nDel. Jeff Ghrist (R-36) is behind two bills on solar energy regulation: House Bill 739 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 478) and House Bill 742. One bill would prohibit the use of eminent domain for solar siting, while the other would return control over solar development to county governments.\nGhrist also introduced House Bill 736, which seeks to remove the mandate requiring local school systems to offer pre-kindergarten for three-year-olds. Another provision in the bill would increase state funding to help Kent County construct a new middle school.\nOn law enforcement, Ghrist is supporting a bill \u2014 potentially House Bill 122 \u2014 that would require the removal of unfounded complaints from police personnel files.\nNursing, Historic Preservation, and Cemetery Protections\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-37B) has proposed House Bill 602 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 407), directing the State Board of Nursing to negotiate reciprocity agreements with neighboring states for advanced practice nursing licensure. Another measure, House Bill 616 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 421), would extend the statute of limitations for crimes related to cemetery destruction and prohibit damaging cemetery landscaping. The bill is co-sponsored by Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-37A).\nHutchinson is also behind House Bill 760, which would establish a local appeals process for Maryland Historic Trust decisions.\nBudget Deficit Shifts to Counties\nGov. Wes Moore's proposed budget shifts some of the state's structural deficit onto county governments. Del. Jeff Ghrist (R-36) criticized the move, stating that counties did not contribute to the deficit but are now being forced to compensate for state overspending.\n\"For my district, $720,000 will be shifted to Caroline County on top of an additional $1.8 million more that the county will have to add to education under Kirwan mandates,\" Ghrist stated. He cited similar financial burdens for other Eastern Shore counties, including Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne's.\n\"This will stifle economic growth because people will be sending more of their hard-earned money to the government rather than spending it in their local economies,\" Ghrist added.\nLaw Enforcement and Traffic Stop Restrictions\nA controversial proposal, Senate Bill 292, has drawn strong opposition from law enforcement officials, including Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker. The bill would reclassify certain primary traffic offenses as secondary offenses, preventing law enforcement from stopping drivers solely for those violations.\n\"These minor traffic violations could actually lead to catching suspects that have committed serious felonies, recovering firearms, and stopping drug-related crimes,\" Baker said. A hearing on the bill is scheduled before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee.\nOther Bills of Local Interest\nHouse Bill 28, sponsored by Del. Josh Bouchat (R-5), proposes a constitutional amendment requiring all Maryland counties to adopt a charter government structure.\nHouse Bill 278, also from Bouchat, would provide an income tax subtraction modification for enhanced agricultural management equipment to support sustainable farming practices.\nHouse Bill 192, introduced by Del. Nino Mangione (R-42A), aims to curb student cell phone use in schools under the proposed \"No Distracted Learning Act.\"\nAs these bills move through the legislature, local officials and residents will have the opportunity to voice their support or concerns during committee hearings and public forums. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Founding Fathers built a system of checks and balances, a system that some people today would say is eroding.\nSaturday students will show off their knowledge of that system at the inaugural U.S. Constitution Scholastic Competition at the Talbot County Free Library. Students from throughout the Mid-Shore have been invited to test their constitutional knowledge at the event.\nSpeaking of government, at the state level the three Republican delegates representing Maryland's District 36 \u2014 Steve Arentz of Queen Anne's County, Jay Jacobs of Kent County and Jeff Ghrist of Caroline County \u2014 formally filed for reelection Wednesday.\nElection Day is still more than a year away, but the races are already starting to take shape.\n\u2014 Jim Johnson \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Character Counts coaches teach trustworthiness, respect and fairness to school-age kids.\nCurrent Caroline County commissioners and other officials attended and spoke to the expansive impacts both Layton and Mueller had on the local community.\nStacy Seward, one many local softball players coached by Layton, recalled fond memories of her former mentor.\n\"He created lasting memories for so many young athletes,\" said Seward, the county's grants coordinator. \"For example, teaching us how to slide in the playground sand at Denton Elementary School, saying 'If I can get my old body down here, you girls can too.'\"\nSteward said he was key to creating the county's first ever softball travel team.\n\"He was the true backbone to girls' softball, not only in Caroline County, but to the entire Eastern Shore,\" Seward said.\nCommission Vice President Larry Porter said Layton, a commissioner of eight years and former investigator for the State's Attorney's Office, always put Caroline County first.\nDaughter Jaclyn Crawford said her father's \"real gift was his deep commitment to young people.\"\n\"In each role, he was known for his competitive spirit, but above all, his determination to make life safer and better for the community,\" Crawford said.\nIn addition to Crawford, other family members of Roger Layton who attended Saturday's dedication included: wife Faye Layton, sister Rena Callahan, stepfather Ronald Sard, granddaughter Madison Weston, cousin Rick Davis and more.\nAfter Layton's sign was unveiled, the curtain was removed off of a large plaque dedicated to Mueller. Husband John Mueller then reflected on his wife's knack for helping people.\n\"If she heard that you needed something, she'd be the one to offer,\" her husband said. \" ... She was always there first.\"\nHe recalled not just her volunteer efforts as a character coach for elementary school kids, but also her assistance in collecting dog and cat food for the local Humane Society.\nIn addition to John Mueller, his four kids and six grandchildren attended Saturday's dedication, as well as Sarah's mom, Jessie Browne.\nAround four years ago, the Mueller family donated $20,000 to the county for upkeep and improvements at Harmony Community Park, including to the pavilion, walking trails and playground.\nCounty commissioners thanked the Mueller family for their donation to the park and spoke about Sarah Mueller's lasting legacy.\n\"Sarah was more than a neighbor,\" Porter said. \"She was a friend, volunteer, mother and a mentor who gave so much of herself to this community, from her time as a Character Counts coach to her years with the Girl Scouts, where she poured her love into children and back.\n\"By placing her name here at Harmony Park, we make sure her kindness, spirit and her legacy will always be a part of this place.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "MACo leaders meet with Talbot officials to discuss 2026 General Assembly\n\n September 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 536\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Leaders from the Maryland Association of Counties shared predictions for a calmer legislative session in 2026 during a meeting with the Talbot County Council on Tuesday.Michael Sanderson, MACo's executive director, and Jack Wilson, the association's president and current Queen Anne's County commissioner, met for an annual check-in with Talbot officials.\nSanderson reminded the council members of last year's volatile General Assembly session, during which legislators and Gov. Wes Moore (D) had to reckon with closing a $3 billion gap in the state's fiscal year 2026 budget.\nSome savings came through cost shifts placing more burden on county governments, the MACo leaders said. But they added that the upcoming 2026 session, and the fiscal year 2027 budget that goes along with it, likely won't be as dire.\n\"Relatively calm, probably not a big crisis,\" Sanderson said of his projection for this year's session, which officially kicks off Jan. 14 in Annapolis.\nHe said the large budgetary concerns are likely to reappear in 2027 as legislators put together a plan for fiscal year 2028.\n\"The story from last year is gonna repeat itself, but with a year off,\" Sanderson predicted.\nSpecifically, the executive director said Maryland's expansive education funding formula, The Blueprint, will influence the 2027 session. And in the short-term, some counties are already coming to grips with increasing cost shares for education.\n\"Every county is either in the midst or a year or two away from seeing a year where the increase in school spending required under Blueprint requires all the money or even more money than your county's likely to gain in revenue for that year,\" Sanderson said. \"It's an obvious squeeze at the local level.\"\nTalbot County's fiscal year 2026 budget included $55 million in education funding required by The Blueprint's formulas. On top of that, the council approved an additional $600,000 in funding to fill new positions.\nThat mark had been scaled back twice from the original ask the Talbot Board of Education made of the council \u2014 first requesting $5.5 million in supplementary funds, then $1.1 million.\nCounty Council Vice President Pete Lesher, who supported the district's $1.1 million request earlier this year, said it was \"short-sighted\" for the county to only fund the district's request partially, given that Blueprint requirements are only set to increase in future years. But other council members opted to hold back on dedicating the full request as the county aimed to even out its spending hikes seen in years prior.\nSanderson said on Tuesday that housing legislation will be at the forefront this winter. Recently, Moore signed an executive order that aims to speed up the permitting and building of affordable housing projects.\n\"I anticipate that being a big fight,\" Sanderson said. \"Whether it's a big fight in the more rural jurisdictions is yet to be seen.\"\nCouncil Member Lynn Mielke asked how Easton fits into state plans to tackle the housing issue.\nSanderson said there's an opportunity for MACo to advocate for provisions so a potential housing package doesn't \"overwhelm\" local jurisdictions. He said the association can help push for certain changes to help counties and towns that lack authority in certain areas, such as the variation of impact fees on developers.\n\"At the same time, we generally want to keep land use decisions local,\" he added. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore fights for the Shore\n\n October 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 336\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I've been a Republican all my life \u2014 as the mayor of my town, as a delegate who defeated a Democratic incumbent to serve in Annapolis, and when I voted for Donald Trump in the last presidential election.There's no doubt I'm a Republican, but I'll proudly cross that party line to back Gov. Wes Moore and his mission to build a Maryland that leaves no one behind.\nI was born in Salisbury, raised near Crisfield and served the people of Delmar for two decades \u2014 I know what it's like to live in a community that feels forgotten by Annapolis. I've worked with a lot of local leaders and several governors, trust me when I tell you, Wes Moore is different.\nIn two and half years, he's made 51 visits to the Eastern Shore and just last week was the first governor to visit Smith Island since 1999. But he doesn't just come to the Shore; he brings investment with him.\nSince taking office he's put $1.9 billion in education funding here; he's made historic investments in rural health care and hospitals opening TidalHealth in Salisbury and breaking ground on the University of Maryland Shore Regional Medical Center; he's put a $10 million investment to improve our waterways up and down the Shore; and he's cut through the red tape to open and expand businesses in places like Caroline County and Dorchester County.\nBut perhaps most importantly, he's focused two of the state's strongest poverty fighting initiatives in our rural communities. His ENOUGH Act includes funding to Dorchester and Caroline counties to end generational childhood poverty, and Cambridge was named as one of the first Just Communities giving them priority access to funding that will help increase assets, home ownership and home values.\nWe are seeing momentum across the state and in our own communities that we just can't afford to lose. I've endorsed him, I believe in him, and I'm proud to work alongside him, because I know Gov. Moore fights for the Shore.\nCARL L.

Chris Adams and Tom Hutchinson and Sen. Johnny Mautz, all Republicans who represent multiple Mid-Shore counties.\nAt one point, council member Dave Stepp asked the legislators which additional cost burdens the state may place on counties heading into fiscal year 2027.\n\"Name it,\" Adams responded.\n\"I think that the assumption that there'll be additional burdens and additional costs is probably a safe assumption,\" Mautz said.\nCounty Council Vice President Pete Lesher pointed out the state legislature's choice last fiscal year to require counties pick up a portion of teachers' pensions payments, which are run through a state program. Talbot's share was $440,000, which prompted an increase, albeit slight, in the property tax rate for residents.\nLesher said if the state wants counties to increase financial responsibilities for the pensions, counties should be granted authority over the program, too.\n\"We're just being handed the bill,\" Lesher said. \"And if they want to share this responsibility, share the authority. But obviously there's no interest in doing that.\"\nIt's unclear exactly which cost shifts could be at play with session still weeks away, but the Republican legislators and county officials spent much time during Tuesday's meeting discussing The Blueprint, Maryland's expansive funding and improvement plan for education.\nIn fiscal year 2026, the county was required by the Blueprint to include $55 million in education funding in its budget. That share will sharply increase in future years, according to reports from the state Department of Legislative Services as of the spring.\nIn Talbot County, the required funding mark could hit $90 million by fiscal year 2034, a hike school officials described as \"sobering.\"\nOn Tuesday, Talbot County Finance Director Martha Sparks shared concerns with discrepancies state agencies have had when calculating the minimum funding marks counties must dole out to areas such as education and health departments.\nSparks said in the past, \"core funding\" required by the Maryland Department of Health to go to local health departments was off by around $250,000. The discrepancies have put other counties in more of a bind, she acknowledged, but still impact Talbot since the notice of changes from the state agencies come after the county has already significantly completed or passed its budget.\n\"These differences in funding have been small, relatively so,\" Sparks said. \"They're still large for us. We want our budget to be right.\"\nHOTEL TAX COLLECTION\nSparks and the Eastern Shore legislators opened Tuesday's meeting with a short discussion on Senate Bill 979, a law which will soon require the Comptroller's Office to collect certain accommodations tax information from companies such as Airbnb and Vrbo. Currently, counties are the collectors.\nHutchinson said while the bill gained support from some jurisdictions, it could actually hurt Talbot County since the finance office has a \"terrific\" collection system.\n\"In Talbot County, the bill was a negative to them,\" he said. \"To other counties \u2026 where they don't really have a process in place, they were somewhat supportive of it.\"\nLesher said if the state assumes the collection duties, Talbot County could lose timely access to important tourism and rental data. Legislators were optimistic that Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) is open to allowing an opt-out to the bill mandating the state take over collection.\n\"I think it'd be helpful if the council would say, 'We don't want the state to collect this,'\" Mautz said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Here's the problem with that: Hairdryers, curling wands and flat irons are required to produce heat, which means they pull large amounts of amperage to get them good and hot. Plugging them into a power strip is just asking for trouble. These types of hairdressing appliances must be plugged directly into a wall outlet - preferably one with a ground-fault circuit interrupter breaker to avoid danger should those tools accidentally be exposed to water.REFRIGERATOR AND FREEZER.These appliances pull too much current for a power strip because they are continuously cycling on and off.That will quickly overload a power strip. These items need to be plugged directly into a wall outlet dedicated solely to that appliance.TOASTER.Here's the clue: It has exposed wires inside those slots that heat up to become red-hot. It takes a lot of current to fire up those wires, which can easily overload a power strip. So, no, do not plug your toaster into an extension cord or power strip.Ditto for your toaster oven.MICROWAVE.I still think of my microwave oven as a miracle for food preparation, thawing, cooking and reheating in a fraction of the time it takes a conventional oven. However, such incredible activity demands more energy than what a power strip can deliver.SPACE HEATER.Most portable heaters consume 1,500 watts of energy on their high settings. Connect one to a power strip and it becomes potentially hazardous due to allowing them to run for an extended period. \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Currently, volunteer firefighters on the Mid-Shore have two options for training facilities in Princess Anne in Somerset County or Centreville in Queen Anne's County.Components of the project include a 3,500-square-foot concrete public safety building for first responder training, a 3,600-squarefoot classroom training and storage building and a 1,500-square-foot concrete pad for car fire, extrication and stabilization, and traffic safety training.Training for fire departments will include firefighting skills, rescue, and motor-vehicle fire and extraction. Law enforcement training will include hostage rescue, physical training and testing, traffic training, Homeland Security and K-9 operations. Emergency Medical Services can use classroom facilities for their training.\"This state-of-the-art training campus will not only support EVFD members for their training but will also help us in recruiting and training new members for the department. The training campus will also enable us to support our partners in law enforcement and emergency services in their training and recruitment needs and to better coordinate our roles in emergencies.We encourage the community to support our fundraising efforts as we embark on this $5 million goal,\" said fire Capt. Daryl Caldwell.The town of Easton gifted the use of a 2.7 acre property on Mistletoe Drive to the volunteer fire department for a state-of-the-art training center. This facility will serve both the town of Easton and the six local volunteer fire departments in Talbot County, as well as fire departments across the Mid-Shore. Talbot County has 260 active firefighters that respond to thousands of calls. EVFD responded to 896 calls involving 10,000 man hours in 2022 and conducted 1910 hours of training in 2022.\"It has never been more important than now to train our first responders and emergency personnel who serve Talbot County every day. There currently is no dedicated first responder training campus in Talbot County. The Friends of the EVFD and its volunteers accepted the challenge to raise $5 million for facility construction and operational expenses for the new campus.This campaign is essential toward ensuring cutting-edge training is available for all emergency services personnel,\" said campaign co-chairman Brett Whitehead.\"The sheriff's office is very excited to see this project come to fruition. The facility will not only offer training to our dedicated volunteer firefighters but will be able to support training for our deputies and police officers. Our citizens deserve the best-trained law enforcement officers. This training facility will support localized training to better equip our deputies while saving hard-earned taxpayer funds through reduced travel time and associated expenses. The facility will also be available for K-9 training for tracking people as well as drug detection,\" Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said.\"We're very excited about the brand-new state-of-the-art training facility to be used by fire departments, EMTs, and law enforcement around the Mid-Shore. This facility will allow us to train and recruit talented first responders from around the region. The Town is fully committed to helping our first responders safely and effectively serve our community, and this training facility is a crucial resource that will improve many facets of their operations. We are very thankful for the dedication and selfless service of the men and women who volunteer to protect and serve our Town, and thankful that they go above and beyond to ensure our community's safety, Easton Mayor Megan Cook said.For further information or to donate to the Friends of the EVFD Public Safety Capital Campaign for its Emergency Services Training Campus in Easton, contact Brett Whitehead at (302) 236-6249 or by email at whitenj20@gmail.com. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF FRIENDS OF THE EASTON VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT\n \nAn artistic rendering shows the planned Emergency Services Training Campus in Easton. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "It's time to confront ongoing youth violence\n\n September 15, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Armstrong Williams | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 689\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n If you go to Google and type \"heinous crimes up with young people,\" you'll see over 2 billion results.It's a stark reminder that the alarming trend of young people committing gruesome acts isn't a new phenomenon, but the sheer proliferation and frequency of these acts most certainly is. Our society is grappling with a disconcerting reality - a reality born out of the convergence of various factors.From the messages embedded in our music to the desensitizing violence prevalent in our culture, and even the erosion of moral and ethical values, each contributes to the emergence of a more violent society.It's a society where individuals no longer temper their darkest impulses, and regrettably, it's our youth who often find themselves on the frontline, manifesting behaviors at an unacceptable rate. This is a phenomenon that should deeply trouble us all and lead us to pause in concern for the direction in which our society is headed.These young individuals, driven by a cocktail of influences, often react impulsively or, in the gravest of cases, meticulously plan calculated crimes that result in the loss of innocent lives. We've witnessed stories like that of Mackenzie Shirilla, a name etched into the annals of a society grappling with the aftermath of senseless violence.Shirilla was recently found guilty of the murder of her boyfriend, Dominic Russo, and her friend, Davion Flanagan. Their tragic deaths underscore the gravity of the situation we're facing - a situation where young people are becoming entangled in webs of aggression and desperation. In Shirilla's case, she purposely sped up her car to 100 mph and drove straight into a wall, instantly killing her boyfriend and friend.The breakdown of morality in our society is contributing to this disturbing trend. Traditional values that once served as guiding principles seem to be waning, leaving a moral vacuum in which right and wrong are increasingly ambiguous. The erosion of moral foundations means that young people are less equipped to distinguish between ethical choices and destructive actions.The deterioration of ethics further compounds the issue. Ethical conduct is the cornerstone of a civilized society, fostering a sense of responsibility and accountability. Yet, as we witness these disturbing trends among our youth, it becomes evident that the concept of ethics is losing its grip. The pursuit of personal gain, even at the expense of others, has become alarmingly normalized.As we reflect on these developments, the implications for our future are profoundly concerning. A society that permits the erosion of morality and ethics in its younger generation is sowing the seeds of its own demise. The actions of today's youth foreshadow the trajectory of tomorrow's adults. If we fail to address these concerning trends, we risk a future marked by increased violence, social fragmentation and a dearth of empathy.It's time for us to confront these unsettling truths and take meaningful action. By reemphasizing morality and ethics in our families, communities and institutions, we can recalibrate the moral compass of our youth. This requires an unwavering commitment to fostering values that prioritize human dignity, compassion and respect for one another. Only through concerted efforts to restore these foundational principles can we hope to guide our society toward a more harmonious and promising future.This alarming trend of young people exhibiting violence and aggression should serve as an urgent wake-up call for our educational institutions. We must prioritize emotional education alongside academic excellence. By equipping our youth with the tools to manage their emotions, resolve conflicts constructively and communicate effectively, we can help curb the escalation of anger and violence.It's imperative that our schools become places not only of intellectual growth but also of emotional well-being and character development.The rising wave of heinous acts committed by young people underscores the pressing need for a comprehensive societal response. We must address the erosion of morality and ethics, and we must prioritize emotional education within our education system. This is a challenge that requires the collective effort of families, communities, educators and cultural influencers. By refocusing on our shared values, investing in the emotional well-being of our youth and fostering a renewed sense of empathy, we can shape a society that rejects violence and paves the way for a brighter and more harmonious future.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

All of the county's schools will be operating on a two-hour delay schedule Wednesday, Jan. 10, for evaluation of overnight flooding and storm damage, according to the school system.\nQueen Anne's County Public Schools were also dismissed early Tuesday due to the storm. As of Tuesday afternoon, all of the county's schools are set to run on a 90-minute delayed opening Wednesday, with reevaluation and modifications possible in the morning.\nSchools in Talbot and Caroline counties canceled all after-school activities Tuesday. Both districts are monitoring conditions to determine if delays or closures will be necessary Wednesday.\nThe Caroline County Board of Education meeting will be held as scheduled at 6 p.m. Tuesday.\nGov. Wes Moore enacted a State of Preparedness declaration Tuesday morning, directing the state's department of emergency management to coordinate responses to the storm's impacts.\nRainfall of 1 to 3 inches is possible across the region Tuesday, with the heaviest rain expected Tuesday night before tapering off Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe main concern is the potential for coastal flooding in Talbot and Queen Anne's counties, said Mike Lee, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Philadelphia/Mount Holly office. Dorchester County is also expected to experience significant flooding.\nA coastal flood warning is in effect from 7 p.m. Tuesday to 7 p.m. Wednesday for areas along the lower Chesapeake Bay, including Cambridge, which will see major impact from flooding early Wednesday morning, according to the Weather Service. Water is expected be two to three feet above ground level in some low-lying areas.\nA coastal flood warning and a flood watch are in effect for Talbot, Caroline, Queen Anne's and Kent counties from Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday morning.\nModerate coastal flooding is possible Tuesday with the high tide cycle. Water levels are expected to continue rising Tuesday night from strong southerly winds. The rising water levels could lead to potentially significant flooding.\nThe highest tides will be early Wednesday morning and again in the afternoon.\nWidespread roadway flooding is expected across the region's bayside communities and along tidal waterways. Dorchester County could see road closures.\nStrong, gusty winds are also expected to build across the region throughout the day Tuesday.\nDorchester County is under a high wind warning from 4 p.m. Tuesday to 4 a.m. Wednesday, with south to southeast winds of 30 to 40 mph with gusts up to 60 mph possible. Fallen trees, downed power lines and widespread power outages are expected.\nTalbot, Caroline, Kent and Queen Anne's counties are under a wind advisory from 5 p.m. Tuesday to 3 a.m. Wednesday. Sustained winds of 25 to 35 mph are expected, with gusts up to 55 mph.\nThe already-saturated ground in the region has also made trees more vulnerable to becoming uprooted with strong winds.\nThe Talbot County Department of Emergency Services urged residents to make sure loose items are secured ahead of time and reminded residents to not drive through or stand in flooded roadways.\nThe region will dry out some on Thursday, but a second storm is likely to roll through the region again Friday night into Saturday, the Weather Service said.\nThis story has been updated to include information on school delays and closures.

Wes Moore said he expects \"robust debates\" about juvenile justice in coming weeks \u2014 and that his administration will be an \"active participant\" trying to balance rehabilitation with cracking down on crime.\"The hallmark of what I hope to see in any juvenile justice legislation that's going to make it to my desk can be summarized in one word: accountability,\" the governor said. \"I believe in rehabilitation, but I will not tolerate lawlessness.\"\nMoore's comments came Tuesday, a day before the opening of the 2024 Maryland General Assembly, in a press conference devoted to his legislative priorities regarding public safety. He said he plans to press for three measures aimed at promoting victim's compensation, expanding apprenticeships in law enforcement jobs and preventing firearm violence.\nBut he also mused aloud on the issue of juvenile justice, at a time when state Republican officials are calling for passage of tougher crime policies \u2014 and specifically for reversing recent reforms to the youth legal system. House Republican Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany, recently vowed to toughen up what he called Maryland's \"soft-on-crime policies.\"\nMoore said Tuesday he will demand accountability for young offenders who are repeatedly violating the law, or who use a handgun to threaten the safety of others.\nWhile Moore acknowledged the coming debate over juvenile crime this session, he stressed the importance of supporting communities and the advocates working at the grassroots level to prevent violence.\nHe said he supports lengthening probation for juveniles found guilty of certain crimes to allow for more time for rehabilitation programs. He also backs moving more crimes related to illegal guns from misdemeanors to felonies.\n\"It takes a village to raise a child, and it will take a village to build safer communities,\" Moore said.\nThe legislative criminal justice proposals Moore announced do not address the treatment of juveniles, but rather focus on other things.\nHe proposed establishing a firearm prevention center based on recommendations from the Safer States Initiative launched by Vice President Kamala Harris.\nThe statewide office would work in partnership with the White House, taking an \"all of government\" approach to effective prevention and intervention policies or programs, according to Rob Wilcox, deputy director of Biden's Office of Gun Violence Prevention. Maryland would be the first state to establish such a center, said Wilcox, who spoke at Moore's press conference.\n\"It's a critical step to focus investments and drive the strategies that we know will save lives,\" Wilcox said.\nAccording to Moore, 75% of homicides in Maryland are committed with a gun. He said he considers it not only a public safety issue but a public health issue. He pledged to get illegal guns \"off of our streets.\"\nTo help wage that fight, Moore hopes to recruit more people into law enforcement and public safety with a bill to promote apprenticeships.\n\"We need officers who reflect the diversity of our great state,\" Secretary of Labor Portia Wu said, \"and we need them to come from the neighborhoods they serve.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One in three of the top 100 free apps on the Google Play store have banner ads, including ads for adult content, the website says.\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, in 2022, 97% of American teenagers aged 13\u201317 used the internet every day, with 46% responding they used the internet almost constantly.\nDel. C. T. Wilson (D-Charles) was one of the sponsors of the bill.\n\"Tonight's vote is a landmark moment for Maryland kids and families working toward a better, safer online world,\" said Todd Minor Sr. and Mia Minor, parent advocates from Accokeek who founded the Matthew E. Minor Awareness Foundation. \"We've worked hard for this moment, and we're super proud our legislators had the courage and determination to stand up to the Big Tech lobbyists in the hope that other families will never have to suffer pain like ours has endured.\"\nThe Matthew E. Minor Awareness Foundation was created after Matthew Minor died at 12 years old as a result of the \"choking/black-out\" challenge that had been circulating on social media and other internet platforms.\n\"Today's vote shows support for the Kids Code model's safety-by-design and privacy-by-default principles that transcends political divides, reflecting growing public recognition of the urgent need for smart, effective policy solutions to protect kids online,\" Maryland Kids Code Coalition spokeswoman Marisa Shea of St. Mary's County said.\nThe bill has wide-reaching support, with organizations like the Digital Harbor Foundation, the Free State PTA, the Maryland Association of School Health Nurses, the Maryland Coalition of Families and the Maryland State Education Association testifying in favor of it. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Workshop encourages becoming an informed weather spotter\n\n April 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 696\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For Warning Coordinator Meteorologist for the National Weather Service, Sarah Johnson, discussing weather's not just typical small talk.She deals in tornados, hail, high winds and severe storms all the time. As Marylanders escape winter weather, hopefully, there's a pause in the storm seasons.\nJune is considered the beginning of hurricane season and Johnson mentioned some things to stay alert to on the Eastern Shore.\nAt the Kent County Public Library on March 21, she introduced her audience to their program: SKYWARN.\nShe's looking for more and more people to become a spotter, who look out for the basics of thunderstorm development, storm structure and severe weather features, then report the information accurately.\n\"The main mission of the spotter is to be aware of the rapidly changing conditions of the weather,\" Johnson replied.\nAnd it's sorely needed too.\nJohnson said last year they reported the second most severe thunderstorms.\nThe third most for tornado warnings.\nAnd the fourth most in flash flood warnings.\nUnperturbed by the smaller audience in attendance, she was concise and enthusiastic while walking through the process of what to look out for.\nFor instance, people tend to be on high alert when they get something on their phone saying \"tornado warning.\" Not so much when they get a \"severe thunderstorm warning.\"\n\"That's a mistake to think one's worse than the other,\" Johnson commented.\nEspecially when water can be more harmful than wind in most cases, she said.\n\"When we look at the fatalities, 75% in the United States are due to water in some way; 50% of those are those are due to storm surge; 25% freshwater heavy rain flooding. Keep that in mind. Don't think, 'Oh, it's just a tropical storm.' No, you still need to pay attention and see what the hazards are.\"\nSevere storms should not be treated much differently than a tornado.\nShe then pointed out the difference between a storm watch and a storm warning. A watch means to keep an eye on the weather pattern.\nA warning means, don't just watch \u2014 get prepared.\nA severe storm warning means, gather up some candles for light, or buy extra gas for the back-up generator and do things that will prepare your family and yourself for a potential hazard.\nAs hurricanes emerge from the North Atlantic ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, Johnson reminded her audience how to categorize them and what that exactly means.\nHurricanes, big or small, she indicated, can create problems, such as tornados.\nThe uninformed, she added, might hear about a category 1 hurricane and think it's not much of a problem. They'll see it as a little rain and wind. Very minimal damage.\nThe savvy spotter though, will see that even a category 1 hurricane can create big problems, such as a tornado. The spotter will know category 1, simply describes the wind of the hurricane. Nothing else. It does not highlight the possibility of it creating tornados or other adverse weather conditions.\nAnd those who think tornados are only a threat in Kansas are in for a rude awakening.\nTornados hit everywhere, Johnson pointed out. Even in our backyard.\nShe said Hurricane Ida was a remnant tropical system that produced a lot of tornados in 2020.\nHurricane Isaias was a destructive Category 1 hurricane, producing the longest tracked tornado in Delaware history.\nTornados in Cecil County and Southern Delaware \u2014 resulted in fatalities last year.\n\"That's why we need you all,\" she said, encouraging her audience to report their observations to their nearest national weather station.\nTo become a spotter, adults are invited to complete the SKYWARN training.\nThose who finish the course join a volunteer program with between 350,000 and 400,000 trained severe weather spotters.\nIndividuals affiliated with hospitals, schools, churches and nursing homes or who have a responsibility for protecting others are encouraged to become a spotter.\n\"There can be no finer reward than to know that your efforts have given your family and neighbors the precious gift of time\u2014minutes that can help save lives,\" as stated by the NWS.\nAnd as the movie \"Twisters,\" the sequel to the original from 1996, comes out in theaters shortly, Johnson jokes that she's preparing to field a lot more questions about tornados.\nShe discouraged the crowd on becoming storm chasers like sensationalist Hollywood actors and actresses, but rather to become informed citizens who save lives. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

CASA of Caroline Executive Director Amy Horne said the blue in the pinwheels represents the color of bruises, and the pinwheels themselves \"represent the whimsical, carefree childhood that all kids deserve.\"\nAt the annual planting ceremony on Fourth Street in Denton on April 10, Horne said participation has grown throughout the county in the past four years.\n\"My gosh, go up to the Town of Ridgely,\" she said in an interview. \"They have an amazing display.\"\nCASA of Caroline is a nonprofit organization that advocates for and helps find homes for abused and neglected children.\nOn the nonprofit's website, there is a virtual garden that shows where many of the pinwheels have been planted this year. Horn said hundreds of pinwheels have been planted.\nIn the 20 years the organization has been around, it has advocated for more than 100 children in the county, Horne said.\n\"People may think (that because) we're a close-knit county, that it doesn't happen here, but it does,\" she said about child abuse. \"With the tremendous outpouring of support \u2014 as you can see here, and that we receive all over the county \u2014 it's obvious that Caroline County is really committed to being a safe place for children and families.\"\nCASA of Caroline Board President Keith Johnson talked about the different agencies and organizations that are involved when children experience abuse.\n\"We have representatives from Denton Police Department and the (Caroline County) Sheriff's Office here,\" he said. \"A lot of times, those cases start with their work. But as those children progress, they go to social service and then our advocates, which serve each one of those children.\"\nCaroline County Circuit Court Judge Heather Price said in an interview that CASA reports offer an important perspective to judges.\n\"They give me a different angle than what the attorneys representing the parents would say or the attorneys representing the department,\" she said. \"Here you have the voice of the child that's speaking through an advocate.\"\nBefore attendees of the ceremony fanned out to plant pinwheels, citations and awards were handed out. Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) presented CASA of Caroline with a citation in recognition of the Pinwheels for Prevention campaign.\nDel. Jeff Ghrist (R-36, Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline), who was also in attendance at the event, talked about the importance of the services CASA of Caroline offers children.\n\"In order to be able to connect them with that one person that they can trust, it takes a community to do that,\" he said. \"It takes CASA to do that.\"\nAt the event, CASA of Caroline awarded the Caroline Career and Technology Center for the having highest participation across Caroline County Public Schools in coloring pinwheels to inspire hope from children experiencing abuse. Horn said 40% of CCTC students colored pinwheels. She said they will receive a Kona Ice party as their prize.\nCareer center Principal Courtney Handte said it means a lot to her and the center's staff that their students showed support for National Child Abuse Prevention Month, which is April.\n\"It's important for all students to know what is out there and available to them, and that they are not alone,\" Handte said. \"Caroline County is a small community, but we are mighty. And we will surround them with the support and love that they need during challenging times.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A rough road: Students see bad choice consequences in mock crash\n\n April 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARTY MADDEN mmadden@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 579\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A statewide initiative to curb road fatalities continues to send a sobering message to Maryland's newest drivers.What began nationwide decades ago as a lesson in the dangers of blending alcohol with driving now includes in its scenario the sad consequences of not wearing seatbelts or allowing diversions such as cellphones and conversations to take a driver's attention away from the road.\nPublic high schools in Calvert County have annually been the venue for mock crashes. This year three of the high schools participated in crash scenarios with the aid and supervision of emergency responders and police.\nLast week's mock crash at Northern High began with the pretend scenario of a 17-year-old male, hosting a party at his home, hearing the sound of a two-vehicle crash down the fog-shrouded road leading from the house.\n\"I know them, they were just at my house,\" he tells 911.\nAccording to the scenario a female driving a truck is ejected and is soon pronounced dead at the scene.\nA smaller vehicle involved in the crash was operated by a young male who only suffers bruises but is later deemed impaired by alcohol and marijuana. A front seat passenger was not wearing a seatbelt and crews must extricate her from the vehicle. A rear seat passenger is assessed as unhurt but traumatized.\n\"Driving is a responsibility,\" Christy Nizer, Maryland's motor vehicle administrator, told the large group of Northern High students gathered around a back parking lot at the Owings school. \"You need to give your full attention to driving.\"\nNizer warned students that Maryland roads aren't getting any safer with all the distractions adding to the mix of things that can go wrong while traveling.\n\"We lost 600 people in motor vehicle crashes,\" Nizer said of Maryland's 2023 death toll. The number represents a 6% increase from the 2022 total.\nMany high school juniors are starting the transition from holding a learner's permit to being licensed to drive in Maryland.\nNizer and two other speakers \u2014 Christy Bliss, director of training for the Chesapeake Region Safety Council, and Calvert County Sheriff Ricky Cox (R) \u2014 acknowledged during remarks prior to the mock crash that many celebrations, including proms, graduations and parties will be taking place.\n\"You are the one behind the wheel,\" Bliss said, adding that she wanted students to think about, \"what it means to be distracted. What it means to not wear your seatbelt. We want you to make better thought choices. We want to see you in your senior year.\"\n\"I've had to make notifications to parents that their child won't be coming home tonight,\" Cox said.\nOn the subject of impairment, Nizer that there are \"new consequences\" for all drivers that are cited for impaired driving. Legislation passed this year by the Maryland General Assembly expands the state's ignition interlock system program to include those granted probation before judgement for impairment while transporting minors under the age of 16.\nMotorists with court-ordered ignition interlock systems in a vehicle blow into a device in order to get a vehicle to start.\nIn addition to the Calvert County Sheriff's Office and the Maryland State Police, volunteers from local fire and rescue also provided a demonstration of procedures in responding to vehicle crashes. Narration of the crash scenario was provided by Joe DellaCamera, a Metropolitan Police officer, volunteer firefighter and former chief of the Prince Frederick Volunteer Fire Department.\nCoordination of the local mock crashes was done by Debbie Jennings, a Calvert County resident who serves as the region safety council's director of highway safety and special projects. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'He snapped': Maryland teacher sentenced to probation for assaulting doorbell pranksters\n\n June 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1555\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A Rising Sun High School teacher who has served as an educator for 30 years received a suspended six-month sentence and was placed on 15 months of supervised probation Wednesday, after pleading guilty to assaulting a 13-year-old boy after the child and a friend pranked him at his residence.The defendant, Dylan M. Aiman, 54, of Rising Sun, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault, a misdemeanor that is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. In exchange, prosecutors dismissed related charges of reckless endangerment and false imprisonment.\nCecil County District Court Administrative Judge Bonnie G. Schneider rejected a defense request to grant Aiman probation-before-judgement, commonly known as a PBJ \u2014 a verdict in which the presiding judge finds the defendant guilty and then sets aside the conviction, meaning the conviction will not appear on that person's record.\nA PBJ reportedly would have been more favorable for Aiman when the Cecil County Public Schools administration decides on his future employment.\nAssistant State's Attorney Joseph Verratti told the judge that he would not object to Aiman receiving a PBJ.\nAiman's defense lawyer, Thomas C. Morrow of Towson, told the judge that Aiman is on administrative leave, a status that school officials assigned Aiman shortly after a Rising Sun Police Department officer filed criminal charges against him in the wake of the early-May incident.\nJoseph Buckley, who is the CCPS associate superintendent for administrative services, told the Cecil Whig on Thursday, \"We are aware of the legal matter that's facing one of our employees and we're going to follow all of our human resources processes to access the situation to address the matter. We'll be working with the employee to address the matter. Other than that, at this point, we really have no further comment.\"\nBuckley noted that CCPS officials are not at liberty to release specific information concerning personnel matters.\nFrom the bench, Schneider opined Wednesday that a PBJ verdict would not be appropriate because, according to information provided by the prosecution, Aiman was convicted of failure to obey a peace order in 2012, some 12 years ago. (Aiman reportedly had been granted a PBJ in that 2012 case, which stemmed from a dispute with a neighbor, and he violated the peace order when he entered his neighbor's yard to retrieve as Nerf lawn dart that his son had shot onto that property.)\nElecting to still accept the plea deal, knowing that the judge would not grant him a PBJ, Aiman pleaded guilty to second-degree assault. Then, after Verratti read aloud the statement of facts, Schneider found Aiman guilty of that offense and imposed a suspended six-month sentence on him. (Verratti had recommended a suspended one-year sentence, one year of supervised probation, an anger management class and no contact with the victims in the proffered plea agreement.)\nIn addition, the judge ordered Aiman to serve 15 months of supervised probation. Schneider acknowledged that Aiman already had successfully completed an anger management class since the incident occurred. The judge, however, ordered Aiman to take another anger management course if his probation officer deems that it is necessary.\nThe judge also ordered Aiman to have no contact with the two victims, one of whom turned 14 about three weeks after the incident.\nMoments before sentencing, Aiman stood at the defense table, reflected on the incident and told the judge, \"I clearly way overreacted.\"\nHis words echoed ones uttered moments earlier by Morrow, who reported that Aiman has an unblemished employment record during his 30 years as an educator, the last 24 of which in Cecil County, and that he is a RSHS biology teacher, one who teaches predominantly honors classes, in addition to that subject at other levels.\nMorrow advocated for an outcome in the criminal case that might result in the \"salvaging of his (Aiman's) career.\"\nTHE INCIDENT\nAiman chased the two boys in the early evening of May 4, which was a Saturday, after they rang the doorbell at his residence in the 200 block of Turtleneck Court and ran away \u2014 a prank known as \"ding dong ditch.\"\nAfter catching the teens across the street from his home, Aiman forced them back to his front porch, where he made the boys wait for police officers to respond after calling authorities and making a harassment complaint, according to court records.\nRSPD Pfc. Cunningham and Patrolman Moore responded to the scene at 7:32 p.m., and Aiman told them that he \"gripped one up,\" referring to one of the teens. Aiman maintained that he gave chase after the second time that the ding-dong-ditch prank had been pulled at his residence that evening.\nIn the courtroom Wednesday, the prosecutor reported that Aiman grabbed one of the boys by his sweatshirt, lifted him up by the garment and kneed him in the ribs. Verratti also reported that Aiman handled the situation in \"an aggressive manner,\" which included him yelling at the boys.\nCunningham informed Aiman that \"he could not put his hands on juveniles and that it does classify as an assault,\" according to court records.\n\"(Aiman) did not seem to understand, asking what he was supposed to do \u2014 let them run away. (Aiman) continually stated that he just held the kids on his front porch until the police arrived,\" court records show.\nAiman did not know the boys, who live in his neighborhood, according to the defense.\nInvestigators filed charges of second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and false imprisonment against Aiman on May 5, a day after the incident, and served him the criminal summons on May 6, court records show. He was released on personal recognizance.\n'HE SNAPPED'\nMorrow maintained that the incident was an aberration.\nHe reported that Aiman served as a soccer coach for RSHS boys and girls teams and as a coach for Cecil County Department of Parks and Recreation youth soccer teams, in addition to his 30-year career as a teacher, and that he received no official complaints.\nThe defense lawyer also told the judge that Aiman and his family have been the target of harassment in the Rising Sun community by unknown people for an unspecified long time, with encroachments including people hurling eggs at the Aiman house \u2014 which required professional cleaning \u2014 and cars and placing \"anonymous threats in his mailbox.\".\nAiman reported those incidents to police \"multiple times\" in the past, but nothing was done, Morrow said. Officers told Aiman that it would be difficult for law enforcement to take action unless he was able to identify the culprit or culprits, he added.\n(Speculating on why Aiman was harassed, Morrow told the judge that Aiman is \"a good teacher\" who teaches biology at a high level, which can be difficult and frustrating for students. Aside from the two boys who admitted to playing the May 4 ding-dong-ditch prank at Aiman's home, however, no one has been identified as a perpetrator of the previous purported pranks and harassment directed at him and his family.)\nAiman caught the teens and held them on his porch until officers arrived because he wanted parents and authorities involved, according to Morrow.\n\"It was not his intent to injure anyone,\" Morrow said, stressing that Aiman told one of the boys, \"I want you to call your father right now,\" after escorting the teens to his porch.\n\"His only intent was to get some kind of parental involvement to end this trend of harassment,\" Morrow said.\nThe defense lawyer also emphasized that Aiman is \"facing potential dismissal and the loss of his teaching certificate\" after 30 years as an educator.\nAiman's wife spoke on his behalf, telling the judge that her husband's action on May 4 was uncharacteristic. She blamed his response on the frustration and weariness of enduring pranks and various types of harassment over the years. She and Aiman have been married for 24 years.\nShe opined that a family's home should feel like \"a safe place,\" one that provides \"peace, a respite,\" before maintaining that the prolonged harassment had eroded her family's sense of tranquility and that the ding-dong-ditch prank on May 4 pushed her husband to his limit.\n\"He snapped. He had enough,\" Aiman's wife said.\nShe commented, \"He's a great man, a loving father and a great husband . . . He's remorseful and sick about it (the incident).\"\nAiman, who has six children, apologized to the two victims, their families, his own family, the school system and county parks and recreation moments before sentencing.\n\"I let all of them down, including myself,\" Aiman said. \"I worked with kids to give them a positive experience in the classroom and on the soccer field.\"\nHe also alluded to the question hanging over his career in education, remarking, \"Teaching is very important to me.\"\nA LEVEL OF LEADERSHIP\nThe father of the boy whom Aiman picked up and kneed in the ribs told the judge that he was surprised when he learned that Aiman was a teacher.\n\"He's trained to deal with kids, to show a level of leadership. He should be someone to look up to,\" the father said. \"It's concerning to me that this man is employed by the school.\"\nThe mother of the other boy also addressed the judge. She acknowledged that, although Aiman did not aggressively touch her son to the level that he did to her son's friend, the interaction with Aiman negatively impacted her son. She contended that Aiman yelled threateningly.\nAccording to the woman, her son was afraid to walked into a store by himself one day after the incident. \"I'm concerned how quickly he went into anger,\" she said of Aiman. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said a lot of the money for these donations, which Post 77 makes annually, is raised through the slot machines located at the post.\nDonations were made to volunteer fire departments in Talbot County, nearly 20 churches and a variety of other organizations, such as the Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers, the Talbot Senior Center, the Frederick Douglass Honor Society and the Neighborhood Service Center.\nRepresentatives from these organizations came out Saturday morning to the American Legion to accept the donations.\nBlack said the event was wonderful and all the recipients were \"very pleased.\"\nAccording to a statement from one recipient organization, Channel Marker, which offers mental health and wellness support, this donation will help improve the wellbeing of its clients' lives.\nCritchlow Adkins Children's Centers Executive Director Cristy Morrell said the event Saturday was \"lovely.\"\n\"They support such amazing organizations in our community,\" she said. \"And they're not always organizations that I think people are aware of. And so, that they include us in with those organizations is very humbling and we're very honored.\"\nMorrell said the \"generous\" donation will be used for enrichment programming and tuition assistance at the Children's Center's Trappe and Easton locations.\n\"I'm just honored that they consider us a worthwhile cause,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

School officials noted that EHS football games average roughly 1,200 attendees, and other fall sports games can bring in 300 to 400.\n\"We are introducing the CEIA OPENGATE weapons detection system to enhance the security measures and safety for our students, staff, and community alike,\" Elkton High School Principal Dr. James Leitgeb wrote in a letter to EHS parents and guardians. \"This advanced security technology is a walk-through detection system designed to identify and prevent unauthorized or potentially harmful items from being brought onto our campus.\"\nThe new system is consistent with Elkton High School's strict policy banning weapons on school grounds for any reason.\nLeitgeb noted that the system is portable, and the school plans to make use of it beyond the fall sports season.\n\"We are doing this for our fall events, and eventually we do plan on using [the system] for our indoor winter games,\" said Leitgeb.\nThe OPENGATE system is comprised of two upright detectors that will be placed at the entrance to the stadium, which will likely look familiar to those who have gone to a professional sports game or concert recently. CEIA, an Ohio-based metal detector manufacturer, touts that the system scans bags and backpacks automatically, allowing lines to proceed through the gates faster.\n\"This system is highly effective yet minimally intrusive, allowing students, staff, and visitors to enter school premises without significant delays or disruptions,\" Leitgeb said.\nThe implementation of the system is part of a partnership between EHS and Elkton Police Department. According to Leitgeb, EHS staff will man the gates and, in the event of any alerts from the system, EPD officers and the School Resource Officer will be on hand to help handle the situation.\n\"One of my highest priorities as principal is the safety of our students and guests,\" Leitgeb said. \"This is true not only during the school day, but at night time events as well.\"\nLeitgeb also noted that the purchase of the system is part of a grant-funded pilot program and, if successful, other schools in Cecil County will make use of similar systems.\nThe detection system was slated to make its debut at Elkton's home football opener on Sept. 6 at the school's stadium. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The incident involved three students and one staff member and ended with a student being transported to a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.According to a press release released by the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, the assault happened on Tuesday afternoon. The videos paint a picture of the incident, though no further official statement has been released by law enforcement on the assault.\nIn the videos, a group of students are circling around the three students involved in the assault. Seconds into the video, one student in a black hoodie moves toward a student in a red hoodie and assaults him. The student in red falls to the floor. Immediately following, an additional student in a gray hoodie proceeds to join in the assault.\nIn the video, a male staff member in a white shirt attempts to protect the student that is being assaulted and physically puts his body on top of the student, seemingly to act as a barrier between the students.\nThe other two students seemingly continue to assault the student in red and begin to also assault the staff member. Soon after, other staff members intervene and separate the students and defuse the situation. The incident lasted around 30 seconds.\nDeputies were able to identify two victims of the assault, one was an Easton High School staff member and the second was a student of the school. No identities have been released, and the incident is currently under investigation.\nThe assault resulted in one student being transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton via Talbot County Department of Emergency Services to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\nThe two other students in the video were identified and arrested in relation to the assault.\nAccording to a statement from Debbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools, the event is being evaluated and those involved will face appropriate disciplinary action.\n\"The safety of our students and staff is always our top priority.

It was not immediately shared by law enforcement if the Easton High lockdown resulted from this threat or from a separate threat.\nOn Monday morning, Gamble said all school resource officers in the district were aware of the threat, and extra deputies were patrolling.\nOn Friday, TCPS students were put in a modified lockdown following a threatening social media post made that morning. According to the Sheriff's Office, the threat originated outside of the United States and similar threats were made to schools in Easton, Pennsylvania.\nThis report will be updated. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After that, the K-9 units were invited to the Kent County Middle School to receive something special.\nIn a gesture of police support, the Kent Puppy Pals 4-H Dog Club donated a Line of fire Defense Street Fighter vest to Addy, a German Shepherd, handled by Dfc. Craig Lewis of the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office.\nGoing through Kent County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Scott Lockerman's organization, the Maryland Police K9 Foundation, the Puppy Pals donated a check for $300 in June.\nClub Leader of Puppy Pals Kim Montooth explained each year they do a service project. Last year, for instance, they raised money for the Humane Society. This year was exciting for the kids and something different, Montooth said.\nMolly's Place also donated $1,000 in a vest for Waylon, a K-9 black lab handled by Pfc. Nick Lang of the Easton Police Department.\nIn front of about 20 people, the dogs modeled the vests, which are lightweight enough yet specially designed to protect their vital organs.\nThen the Puppy Pals kids and their families gathered around to pet the dogs.\nAfter the children met with the dogs and 4-H mom Karri Bryant had a playful tug of war with Addy, they were invited into the school where they witnessed a live demonstration of how Addy sniffs out controlled substances.\nControlled substances were stashed in two classrooms. Led by Lewis, sniffing desks and drawers, Addy alerted to the controlled substance in both rooms in about 30 seconds.\nTrainer Mark Carr of Tidewater Strategic Services said the dog doesn't go right to the spot because of the nature of scent itself. The K-9 moves around the perimeter of the room, getting the entire scent. Once she gets a complete picture, she can hone in.\nPresident of the club Trenton Montooth was impressed. At 14 years of age, he has decided he wants to be a K-9 officer.\nLockerman thanked the Puppy Pals and Molly's Place, expressing the importance of their giving by showing the positive impact K-9 dogs make.\n\"K-9's make the community safer with their presence. Crime rates go down. Schools are much safer. Even the town's property values go up,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Instead, the program keys on the behavior aspect.\n\"We really want to make sure that we're giving these clear (messages) to children to focus on the behavior and how somebody makes us feel or what they're asking us to do, as opposed to the relationship,\" Quillet said.\nIn the children's portion of the program, children were encouraged to identify five trusted adults. Quillet encouraged parents and guardians to \"be comfortable that (they) might not be the person that (children) come to for everything.\"\nHaving trusted adults in different spaces is important not just for young children but also teenagers, Quillet noted. With the dangers of technology and the internet, she said the 12- to 17-year-old age range is \"more vulnerable than ever.\"\n\"We see a lot of things locally that revolve around technology and often used as a grooming practice,\" she said.\nAt the end of the hourlong presentation, Quillet said parents should stay involved in their children's activities and choose caregivers carefully.\n\"There should never be a time where I'm not allowed to have access to my children or I'm not allowed to watch them,\" she said. \"\u2026 Screen all your caregivers carefully.

    "content": "Bus driver likely to face charges after abandoning students at the wrong stop\n\n October 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 733\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A bus driver for Newark Charter School in Delaware is expected to face charges after 10 elementary school students were abandoned at the wrong bus stop.The incident happened Tuesday afternoon as Bus #28 was driving the students home for the day. School officials called police at approximately 4:15 p.m. to report the incident, according to Sgt. Joseph Conover, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department.\nThe driver made the students \u2014 ranging from kindergarten to fifth grade \u2014 get off the bus at a stop in Robscott Manor, which is not their normal stop, Conover said.\nA parent waiting for her child at that stop realized that extra students exited the bus and called the school and police to report the incident.\nSchool officials and officers from the Newark and New Castle County police departments all rushed to Robscott Manor, where they found the students safe.\n\"The cooperative efforts between Newark Charter School, the Newark Police Department and its law enforcement partners ensured the safe reunification of all of the students with their guardians,\" Conover said.\nState troopers tracked down the bus and confirmed that there were no more students aboard.\nConover said Newark's school resource officers are still interviewing students and families but he expects the driver to be arrested and charged with multiple offenses.\nPolice are still trying to figure out exactly why the students were told to get out in Robscott Manor. The neighborhood is on the bus route, but some of those students live a significant distance away from where they were dropped off, Conover said.\nThe mother of one of the affected students told the Newark Post she was waiting for her child to come home and was tracking the bus via an app that parents have access to. She began to get concerned when the bus was late and she saw on the GPS tracking app that the bus was going in the wrong direction.\nShe then got a call from the parent who witnessed the kids get kicked off the bus, and she went to Robscott to pick up her child.\nShe started to piece together what happened by talking to her son.\n\"He said they were at a stop, and the bus driver said 'Everybody get off the bus. Get your stuff and get off,'\" recounted the mother, who asked not to be identified out of concern for her child's safety.\nSome of the children were confused and scared and refused to get off, she added. At the next stop on the same street, the driver again told them it's the last stop and they had to get off, and the remaining students eventually complied.\nShe said she told her son she was proud of him for helping his younger classmates.\n\"It's just a crazy thing, but I do feel like the kids really stuck together and they kind of took care of each other,\" she said. \"I think that made a lot of the parents feel better.\"\nShe also praised school officials for reacting quickly to ensure the students were safe.\nThe mother said she has decided to let her child continue to ride the bus, but she will be more alert about knowing who is driving her child.\n\"You don't really think about who is it that's driving the bus,\" she said. \"You don't really see them a whole lot. You just kind of let your kid get on, and there they are.\"\nThe incident has taught her to be more vigilant about talking to her child about what happens during bus rides.\n\"A big takeaway with all the parents is just to kind of watch out a little bit more and try to notice if things do seem strange and having your kid be able to tell you if things seem off,\" she said.\nThe driver, whose name has not yet been made public, is an employee of Advanced Student Transportation, the bus company Newark Charter has contracted with since the school opened 23 years ago.\n\"Yesterday's incident was unfortunate and we are tremendously disappointed that it occurred,\" Head of School Sam Golder wrote in a letter to parents. \"The bus driver will no longer be driving for Newark Charter School.\"\nGolder assured parents the school is fully cooperating with the police investigation.\n\"Student safety is, and will continue to be, our number one priority at Newark Charter School,\" he said. \"I personally have three children of my own and I would not have tolerated yesterday's behavior, had my children been riding this bus.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Resource officers already serving the school district fall under the direction and budget of the county sheriff's office.\nThe statewide grant funding assists in supplementing law enforcement coverage for public schools with $10 to 15 million in FY26 and $20 million in FY27 and each year thereafter, he said.\nAs school security is considered a top state priority, a minimum three years of funding following this year is secured, according to Saboury.\n\"So really that's putting additional eyes and ears in our schools, which is a wonderful thing,\" he said.\nAs a member of the district, the SSE works more closely with school leaders on safety measures, often outside law enforcement scopes, and are more closely involved with student behavior, support and providing intervention to mitigate and prevent harm, he said.\nAs district employees, QACPS has the flexibility to utilize SSEs for after school sporting events or field trips Saboury said.\n\"It's a great resource that the school district has never had before,\" he said.\nSSEs are held to the same standards and certification programs through the Maryland for School Safety Model training as SROs.\nTraining, uniforms, equipment and overtime are all budgeted into the grant with no cost the district, he said.\nWith the potential for increased funding down the road, Saboury was hopeful to be able to build the program and continually create a safe learning environment for students. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Her recommendations included reducing the speed limit and putting in a crosswalk and extra signage.\n\"Her proactive approach to avoid a potential hazard and commitment to create (a) safe environment is essential in reducing traffic-related incidents,\" the commendation read.\nDorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said he received a call from Wanex, who told him there was no safe crosswalk at the high school for students who walk home from school.\nPfeffer said he was surprised by what Wanex told him because he knows there are students who walk home from school.\n\"So we had people look into it,\" he said.\nWith the help of Dorchester County Sheriff's Deputy Steve Mills and county staff, they were able to get the issue resolved, Pfeffer said.\n\"Thanks to Aubrey here, there's now a safe crosswalk,\" he said.\nPfeffer and the County Council weren't the only ones who thanked Wanex during the meeting. Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson congratulated Wanex and said her actions are a testament to the good things that many Dorchester County students do for the community.\n\"This is just one example of Aubrey doing a great job for the community and her school,\" he said. \"I thank you and commend you myself. Keep up the good work at North Dorchester High School.\"\nWanex told those at the meeting that when she made the decision to reach out to the county about the issue, she was thinking about the future kids that will have to walk home from school. She said she had an experience where she nearly got hit by a car on Cloverdale Road.\n\"And I was just kind of upset about the fact that there was no crosswalk for kids that walk,\" she said.\nPfeffer thanked Wanex for reaching out to him and encouraged other young people to do the same if they have issues or concerns.\n\"We don't bite,\" he said about the County Council. \"We love to hear from you. I mean, you are the future of this county.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Ground broken for state-of-the-art first responder training facility in Easton\n\n December 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 649\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 First responders, along with local and state officials, broke ground Monday on a state-of-the-art emergency services training facility in Easton.The A. James Clark Emergency Services Training Campus is being constructed on Mistletoe Drive. The 7,200-square-foot facility is intended to allow for cross-training between emergency responders and reduce long commutes for first responders in training.\nBrett Whitehead, president of the Friends of Easton Volunteer Fire Department, co-led the fundraising campaign for the facility with his partner, Ed Forte. Whitehead said on Monday that the campus will be in a world of its own as far as allowing firefighters, police officers, EMS workers and others to train together.\n\"There's no place that I know of \u2026 in the Mid-Shore where three of the legs, if you will, of emergency services can practice together,\" Whitehead said.\nThe closest training facilities are in Princess Anne and Centreville, Whitehead noted. Whitehead believes the Easton facility can be the premier cross-training facility in the region.\n\"We want to be the Taj Mahal,\" he said. \"We want to be the mecca of education for all emergency services as it relates to what we do.\"\nThe campus will have a public safety building and an educational building with classrooms, as well as a 1,500-square-foot concrete pad for car fire and extrication training. Hostage rescues, ladder climbs and traffic safety situations are other ways in which the facilities will be used.\nLeaders from across public safety agencies attended Monday's groundbreaking, including Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble, Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey and Talbot County Director of Emergency Services Brian LeCates.\nLeCates said the facility will be a \"more professional setting\" for collaborating and training to take place. That setting could end up saving lives, he said.\n\"We all know that every second counts,\" LeCates said. \"In real emergencies, lives are at stake, and the difference between success and failure often comes to how we train before the disaster occurs.\"\n\"At least 90% of the calls that we go on involve all three groups,\" Whitehead said. \" \u2026 It allows us to all hone our skills together. And that's the magic of what we're trying to get done. Hopefully in 12 months, we'll have this facility built.\"\nFUNDRAISINGThus far, around $4 million of the $5 million goal has been raised for the A. James Clark Emergency Services Training Campus.\nAs the name indicates, the A. James & Alice B. Clark Foundation and its Board Chair Courtney Clark Pastrick were fundamental in that fundraising success. Last September, the foundation gave $1 million to the fundraising efforts for the training campus. In total, the foundation has contributed $1.9 million to the project.\n\"I don't think I've ever encountered someone as professional and, as my wife reminds me, gracious, as Courtney Clark Pastrick,\" Whitehead said.\nClark Pastrick said she knew the project was a \"perfect fit,\" something her late father, A. James Clark, would be immensely proud of. She thanked all the community members and sponsors who donated to the project in tandem with the foundation.\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said the state House and Senate chambers each contributed $150,000 to the project, a charge led by Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio, a former Republican legislator and Department of Natural Resources secretary.\nFormer Easton Mayor Bob Willey attended the groundbreaking event, adorned with his fellow firefighters in Easton Volunteer Fire Department gear. Mautz, Whitehead and Mayor Megan Cook each thanked Willey for having the original vision to bring a project like this to life.\n\"This is going to go so far as to improving our fire service, but most importantly, to make it safer, so more people will join the fire service,\" Mautz said.\n\"And it is no surprise to me that our very own 62-year veteran of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, Mayor Willey, was the one who sparked this idea. Mayor Willey, we owe you an incredible debt of gratitude,\" he said.\nThis report has been updated to correct the name of the training facility. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In an email to The Star Democrat, the district said the arrest did not take place at the school.\nSchool and police officials say rumors of a parent being detained while dropping off a child at the elementary school are false.\nRepresentatives of the Easton Police Department added that the arrest was made due to outstanding warrants for an individual in town and not as a result of any directive from the new presidential administration. EPD officers were not involved in the arrest, but the department contacted the Department of Homeland Security following the incident as rumors began to circulate.\nAs of Monday, the Talbot school district had not communicated with families regarding the rumors, though counseling and mental health support for students, families and staff has been made available. TCPS' Director of Communications Debbie Gardner said in an email that the district has reviewed its existing protocols around \"actions or inquiries by law enforcement.\"\nLast week, State Superintendent Carey Wright sent a letter to Maryland superintendents outlining the practices school employees should take if immigration authorities enter schools.\n\"If federal immigration officials or law enforcement enter a school building seeking access to students (for interviews and/or questioning), school personnel should contact the local superintendent immediately for guidance,\" Wright wrote on Jan. 23.\n\"School personnel should not argue or debate with immigration enforcement officials but should direct them to the local superintendent or designated administrator for further action,\" the letter read.\nWright's letter comes as Donald Trump's immigration initiatives have brought sweeping policy changes since the inauguration last Monday.\nA directive last week from the Trump administration reversed a policy that established places such as schools, churches and shelters as \"protected areas.\" That policy discouraged immigration enforcement agents from conducting arrests in those areas.\n\"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest,\" Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Benjamine Huffman stated. \"The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.\"\nIn her letter, Wright said that if immigration officials request student records, local schools should consult with their attorneys.\n\"Personnel should immediately notify the student's parent or guardian if an immigration official or law enforcement officer requests or gains access to a student for immigration-enforcement purposes,\" Wright stated, \"unless such access was following a judicial warrant or subpoena that restricts the disclosure of the information to the parent or guardian.\"\nIn a statement, Talbot County Public Schools said that superintendents across the state had a meeting with Wright, as well as the Maryland ICE director. The district is following guidance from the Maryland Department of Education on immigration enforcement actions.\nRegarding the Easton arrest, a spokesperson for Enforcement and Removal Operations' Baltimore field office did not provide specific information on the arrest or if other arrests in the area have occurred in the past week. Enforcement and Removal Operations is a directorate of ICE.\n\"ERO Baltimore works daily to prioritize public safety by arresting and removing undocumented alien offenders who pose the greatest threat to our communities, to include those with serious criminal convictions who have violated our nation's immigration laws,\" an email statement read. \"By focusing on these high-priority cases, we aim to uphold the integrity of our immigration system while promoting the safety and security of Maryland's residents.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Kent ham radio club tests emergency communications skills\n\n January 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 557\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WORTON \u2014 As wildfire recovery begins in southern California and a lengthy reconstruction effort continues after Hurricane Helene devastated the Appalachian area, emergency preparation is getting attention.In Kent, that conversation and training is happening among amateur radio operators prepared for potential disasters on the Eastern Shore.\nStarting at 3 p.m. Saturday, over 24 hours, the Kent Amateur Radio Society club set up satellite and radio equipment in the Kent County High School parking lot. Using emergency power from generators and solar panels, they communicated with 145 stations \u2014 18 were amateur radio satellites.\nWith a refurbished school bus and a camper, they operated from five stations, classified as mobile, including the emergency trailer EMCOMM 1, which contained equipment from the school's ham radio classes taught by WKHS station manager Chris Singleton, a KARS member for 30 years.\nEMCOMM 1 serves as backup when regular emergency dispatch fails.\nThis was part of the American Radio Relay League's Winter Field Day training exercise. Radio operators set up field operations in remote locations \"with the aim to improve their preparedness for disasters, enhancing their operational abilities in adverse conditions.\"\nFor KARS members, ham radio is a lifelong passion, but disaster preparation remains the priority.\nKARS President Chris Cote cited Hurricane Irma in September 2017, when 7.5 million homes lost electricity. Ham radio could become the only communication mode in such situations.\nInside Cote's bus, three stations operate off a 12-volt battery charging from a solar array \u2014 two radio with VHF/UHF capabilities and one satellite communications. They reached operators nationwide without external power all weekend.\nThe event reached young people when Singleton's KCHS broadcasting students operated the ham radio. Junior, Jordana Capp, in her second year of broadcasting, contacted Washington state over a Russian satellite connection.\nJunior, Aidan Maxey, also in his second broadcasting year, made contact with New York. He plans to pursue media studies at Syracuse, impressed with ther program.\nSenior, Alayna Brown, featured on Radio World's Jan. 1 cover, contacted Tennessee. Brown, already certified by the Society of Broadcast Engineers, was recently accepted to Belmont in Nashville, where she plans to work with multitrack recording systems, live stage and master tapes.\nAll three students became interested in ham radio certification after attending the ARRL School Round up on Oct. 21. Brown had communicated with Russia during that event.\nSingleton celebrated his students' interest in this vital skill. He had worked for 15 years to engage youth in ham radio, noting that combining broadcasting skills, live audio, music production and SBE certification opens many career paths.\n\"They are amazed,\" Singleton said. \"They don't get many opportunities to work with this very specialized equipment. It is a rare opportunity.\"\nKARS members continue generating youth interest in ham radio by teaching them radio operating skills and attending the Winter Field Day Contest. They anticipate the ARRL School Club Roundup Contest Feb. 10-14 as well.\nOn Sunday, as Cote's drone photographed their stations, KARS member Bobby Kelley helped newest member Alberto Larotonda dismantle his homemade antenna built from a ski pole, copper pipes and a drywall mud bucket.\n\"My little setup just shows anybody can do this with enough imagination,\" said Larotonda, who joined two months ago.\nCote said while no one wants to think disasters like those in California or North Carolina will strike locally, testing equipment in harsh conditions benefits the county; ensuring first responders that it is battle-tested.\nFor more information about KARS, visit k3ars.org/kars/. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He would then ask the girl \"if the writings were good enough that she could picture them in her mind and if reading them made her feel a certain way,\" court documents allege.\nOne story involved a teacher and a student having sexual relations on a school bus during a field trip, and DiFilippo then told the girl he was planing a field trip and asked if she would like to sit with him on the bus, court records indicate.\nDiFilippo would delete the messages after the girl read them, but she kept screenshots of the messages on her phone.\nDiFilippo's behavior eventually extended into in-person encounters, and he would allow the girl to skip class to hang out with him alone in his classroom during his planning period when he did not have a class to teach. Other times, she would stay in his classroom after class ended and the other students left.\nOn one occasion, DiFilippo told the girl he liked her \"milky white thighs\" and said seeing them made him feel \"like an animal ready to attack his prey,\" court documents allege. Another time, he suggested they go into a closet to kiss, but the girl refused. On a different day, the girl brought DiFilippo an assortment of snack food and asked him which he liked best, to which he replied he liked \"the snack in the dress,\" presumably referring to her.\nCourt records describe one incident in which DiFilippo's behavior turned physical. The girl was sitting on a counter near his desk, and DiFilippo allegedly knelt down and rubbed her legs. The girl told him to stop, which he did.\nIt's not clear why DiFilippo's behavior ended in February 2024. Court records indicate that the girl told her therapist about it in August 2024, sparking a police investigation.\nThe girl provided police with screenshots of DiFilippo's Discord messages, and detectives later subpoenaed Discord for a transcript of the messages sent from his account. Investigators interviewed the girl with help from the Child Advocacy Center in Wilmington.\nDiFilippo turned himself in to police in February after the months-long investigation.\nHe was charged with sexual solicitation of a child, enticement for purposes of sexual conduct, dangerous crime against a minor, promoting sexual solicitation of a child, providing obscenity material to a child, sexual abuse of a child by a person of trust and offensive touching. He was released after posting $65,500 secured bond.\nPolice asked anyone with information or who may be a victim to contact Conway at 302-365-8411.\nAccording to a brief biography posted on Kirk's website, DiFilippo taught in the gifted and talented program and has been a teacher for approximately 15 years. He wrote that his favorite part of the job is \"forming strong bonds and relationships with my students.\"\nA spokesperson for the Christina School District did not respond to a request for comment. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's not all fun and games,\" Tyree said. \" \u2026 When they go into a situation, there's a lot of thinking behind it because they can't violate procedure. If they violate procedure, they can't be a police officer.\"\nJunior Canin Parks said he took the academy to learn more about law enforcement since he is considering entering the field. His favorite week was the virtual reality simulator, during which students were posed with the virtual task of helping people in distress.\nJules Stepp, a Saints Peter & Paul junior, most enjoyed learning about Talbot County's crisis response unit, or SWAT team. Students were shown the inside of a SWAT van and learned about the materials and techniques used in situations that call for crisis response.\n\"It was like we were there with them,\" Stepp said. \"We got to live vicariously through them.\"\nStepp said she recommends the academy to anyone interested. The academy made it clear the extreme level of detail that policing requires, she said.\n\"I was surprised how much detail went into every little thing, and how one little thing can cause a problem so they had to backtrack and think about what the consequences could be,\" she said. \"And how they have to go through so many processes to get grants, peace orders, protective orders and all that type of stuff.\"\nFollowing Tuesday's 10th and final class, Maj. Steve Elliott thanked the students and called them a \"great group\" for the first ever citizens police academy. Lt. J.R Dobson said it was a fun 10 weeks.\n\"I think from day one \u2014 when (Sheriff Joe Gamble) was giving you guys a lesson on when the first sheriff of Talbot County was \u2014 until now, I've seen you all loosen up,\" Dobson said.\nGamble thanked Lori Stepp, the grants administrator for the Sheriff's Office, for procuring a grant to make the police academy possible.\nThe Talbot County Sheriff's Office is now fielding applications for its second citizens police academy. This round is open to county residents 18 and older. Classes are held every Tuesday for 10 weeks beginning April 8. Applications are open until March 31.\nGraduates of the inaugural Talbot County Sheriff's Office citizens police academy:\nYvonne Herrera Hernandez, North Caroline High School.\nIan Knopp, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nEric Loredo, Easton High School.\nSofia Miller, St. Michaels Middle High School.\nCanin Parks, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nJules Stepp, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nCarson Tyree, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nEvelio Urdaneta Delgado, Easton High School. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was transported to Shock Trauma in Baltimore for treatment of life-threatening injuries. He died on Wednesday afternoon, his family said on Facebook Thursday.\nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday, Darren's father, Len Foxwell, wrote that the family is \"eternally grateful for everyone who has sent their love and support, for those who have stepped up with profound gestures of support, and for Darren's friends who drove here from Easton yesterday to say goodbye to their childhood buddy.\"\n\"Each of you have been a lifeline and have honored Darren in your own special way,\" Len Foxwell wrote.\nHis father added that the team at Shock Trauma in Baltimore \"fought like a tiger to keep Darren comfortable, preserve his dignity and provide solace for a family that has been destroyed.\"\nA member of Easton High School's wrestling and lacrosse teams, Foxwell graduated last month. He planned to attend Bethany College in West Virginia this fall and play lacrosse for the Bison.\nFoxwell played the last two years for Easton as a backup defenseman. Easton High boys head lacrosse coach Dennis Keenan said he was popular among his teammates and had a \"bright future.\"\n\"I think he was funnier than he actually thought he was,\" Keenan said. \"The things he would say would just crack me up. He was getting better each day. You could see flashes of brilliance.\"\nFoxwell wrestled for three years at Easton, including under head coach Jason Biringer during his senior year. Biringer said Foxwell had an \"infectious\" personality.\nEarly this past season, Foxwell stepped away from the wrestling team. But after speaking with his coach, he returned and started at the 167-pound weight class for the Warriors.\nAfter returning to the team, Biringer made Foxwell a team captain because of Foxwell's work ethic and focus.\n\"The other wrestlers looked up to him,\" Biringer said. \"He has such a good, gentle demeanor that he was just very well liked.\"\n\"He just had one of those infectious smiles that you're like, 'It's always good to see Darren,'\" Biringer added.\nFamily said on Thursday that arrangements for funeral services and a celebration of life are being made and will be announced soon. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We also love getting to introduce new people to the hobby at such a high-profile event,\" Ruth said.\nWith what is essentially the equivalent of a single lightbulb and no permanent infrastructure, ham radio operators can talk to people around the world.\n\"It's definitely important to have that as a backup and maintain that knowledge of how to use it, \" Ruth said.\nThe public event helps serve as validation to the numerous ham radio volunteers who spend countless hours providing emergency communications, public service work and other benefits throughout the community and region, Ruth said.\nThis year's event was also notable as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted a more active hurricane season than normal and saw the first named storm of the season already, he said.\nWhile incredibly important and useful, smartphone technology is often taken for granted and relies on a multi billion dollar infrastructure that, whether storms or computer glitches, doesn't take a lot to knock down, he said.\nRadios are more than just an old fashioned means of communication, according to Ruth, with new technologies and capabilities always being added that can function on older equipment.\n\"It doesn't always have to be the latest and greatest equipment,\" he said.\nThe club recently introduced a program called WinLink Global Radio Email that, by connecting to pathways, essentially allows emails to be sent through ham radio, he said.\nThe area in Tuckahoe the field day event operated in was essentially a cell phone dead zone and a highlight of the event is showcasing to visiting groups including Scouts how the radios can connect with other operators across the country.\n\"Their eyes light up,\" Ruth said.\nThe Radio Club is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the promotion of amateur radio and service to the community and provides communications support to other local non-profit groups during public events.\nFurther supporting emergency preparedness education, the group also recently donated handheld Family Radio Service radios and tabletop weather radios to Homeland Security classes at Kent Island High School and Queen Anne's County High School, as well as sponsoring an Enrichment, Extension and Intervention class at Stevensville Middle School.\nThese classes are part of a broader initiative offering the Community Emergency Response Team program to students, in partnership with Queen Anne's County Department of Emergency Services.\nThe donated radios will be used to help provide hand-on experience for students to become familiar with radio communications, a vital component of public safety and emergency response training, Ruth said.\nDonations were made possible through a grant by the Amateur Radio Relay League Foundation to promote knowledge and interest in ham radio among youths.\nHappy to welcome anyone curious about ham radios, the Queen Anne's Amateur Radio Club meets monthly and regularly provides demonstrations at community events including all weeklong at the upcoming Queen Anne's County Fair.\nMore information can be found by contacting qso@qaarc.org or visiting qaarc.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Officers entered the school to take down a mock shooter. They joined with paramedics and EMTs to locate mock students in classrooms, assess their injuries and evacuate them from the building in a safe manner.\nResponders often communicated with one another on how to follow the proper incident command tactics, at times acknowledging the improvements they could make to their decisions during the drill. Caroline County Cpl. Kenny Tull said the drills will help improve all aspects of emergency response if a school shooting occurs on the Mid-Shore.\n\"It's a learning experience for everyone,\" Tull said.\nIn previous years, active shooter training took place at schools in Talbot and Caroline counties.\nRecently, the drills have included a team of both law enforcement and EMS personnel called the Rescue Task Force. Once a hallway or area is cleared, officers will protect unarmed EMTs and paramedics in \"warm zones,\" where danger may still exist even if the main threat is eliminated.\nThat practice is life-saving in a real situation, Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said.\n\"Before, (EMS personnel) didn't go in until the building got cleared, which caused more deaths,\" he said. \"The quicker we can get treatment for people, the quicker we can get paramedics in there with us, the more people that hopefully will survive.\"\nStill, the top priority is eliminating the shooter or main threat.\n\"The initial driving force is stop the killing, because the statistics will show you that an assailant can kill more people than you can treat,\" Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey said.\n\"Their driving force is stop the dying,\" Lowrey said of EMTs and paramedics. \"You toggle between those two driving forces.\"\nGamble said first responders have taken FEMA-required incident command training, which serves as a common baseline for members of different agencies.\n\"A lot of this stuff spawned out of 9/11, getting fire, police, paramedics everybody on the same page. Square up communications,\" Gamble said.\nHaving so many agencies on hand Thursday was an opportunity for first responders to acclimate with one another and become more comfortable working together during an emergency response, agency leaders said.\nCaroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker emphasized that local agencies already share a solid rapport.\n\"You'd be surprised how much there is interaction between counties and agencies,\" Baker said.\nPlus, the geography of Mid-Shore counties sometimes means Caroline County police may be first on the scene to a Talbot County emergency, or vice versa.\n\"For something that happens at Preston Elementary, Talbot County will be the first ones there,\" Talbot County Maj. Steve Elliott said. \"If something happens at Chapel Elementary, Caroline County will be the first ones there.\"\nTina Kintop, EMS division chief for the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services, said it's most important for EMTs and paramedics to be disciplined and properly trained to participate in the rescue task force with police.\nOn Thursday, the drills didn't stop when the mock shooter went down. First responders secured students, assessed the severity of their injuries and evacuated them from the building. The job doesn't end there, Kintop said.\nPolice and EMS focus on locating a site for reunification of families. Gamble said different schools already have plans in place for reunification spots, some of which have been used for fire drills or bomb threats in the past.\nBy practicing these processes Thursday, agencies worked to create a streamlined plan they hope they will never have to use.\n\"It's all about organization and accountability,\" Kintop said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Sheriff warns of rising scams targeting local businesses, residents\n\n August 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Headlines \n \n 510\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE \u2014 The Queen Anne's County Chamber of Commerce welcomed Sheriff Gary Hofmann on July 30 as part of its ongoing seminar series, where he provided an in-depth look at the latest scams affecting businesses and individuals \u2014 and the steps they can take to protect themselves.Speaking at the Kent Island Library, Hofmann emphasized the importance of awareness and vigilance in a county he described as \"very trusting and generous,\" where numerous worthwhile charities and nonprofits operate.\n\"Benefactors should always verify the legitimacy of an organization before donating,\" he said.\nHofmann outlined how small businesses, which often lack training and robust IT resources, are frequently targeted. Scammers may use stolen credit cards to place large orders, leaving businesses unaware until it is too late. To reduce risk, Hofmann recommended printing invoices and verifying identification when fulfilling pickup orders.\nHe also warned of phishing emails and fake invoices that can appear legitimate but include malicious links or fraudulent payment requests.\n\"If you find something out of the ordinary or that looks suspicious, take a breath,\" Hofmann said. \"Scammers often use fear or urgency tactics \u2014 like threatening to cut off power \u2014 to compel quick action. It's important to slow down.\"\nOne common scam involves demands for payment via prepaid gift cards. In other cases, scammers impersonate tech support, offering to fix nonexisting issues in exchange for access to personal data.\nHofmann said data harvesting can occur almost anywhere. Fake job postings often request personal information or payment for background checks. \"Check washing\" is also on the rise \u2014 criminals steal checks from mailboxes and alter them to commit fraud. Hofmann advised residents to walk checks directly into the post office to minimize risk.\n\"Using secure payment methods and monitoring accounts regularly is key,\" he said. \"Set up alerts for check clearances and large withdrawals, and implement internal controls like requiring two signatures.\"\nWhen writing checks, Hofmann recommended pressing firmly into the paper to make alterations more difficult. He also urged residents to shred sensitive documents before disposal to avoid \"dumpster identity theft.\"\n\"We don't think about how much information we're putting out there when we throw things away,\" he said.\nWith the rise of contactless payments, Hofmann encouraged people to cover the front of their credit cards at checkout to prevent nearby cameras from capturing card numbers. He also warned about credit card skimmers \u2014 devices that mimic real readers and can steal information from magnetic strips using hidden cameras or overlays.\nOther scams include:\nOverpayment scams, where fraudsters send more than the owed amount and request a refund before the original check bounces.Malicious QR codes that direct users to phishing sites or install malware.Tax scammers impersonating government agencies.Ransomware attacks that encrypt a victim's data until payment is made.\nHofmann stressed that education and prevention are the best tools to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated criminals. Staff training, multi-factor authentication, and careful scrutiny of digital communications are essential.\n\"Taking the extra time to assess and validate links is imperative,\" he said. \"Multi-factor authentication might be inconvenient, but it can save you a lot of headaches down the line.\"\nHe also encouraged reporting suspicious activity. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Woman charged for graffiti acts at Sts. Peter and Paul Elementary\n\n September 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 A woman is being held at the Talbot County Detention Center after being accused of spray-painting graffiti around town, including at Sts. Peter and Paul Elementary School.Sian Radaskiewicz-King, 32, was arrested Friday by Easton police on charges of malicious destruction of property and use of a hate symbol. She was later charged with defacing religious property and disturbing school operations, among other counts.\nAccording to court documents, King allegedly spray-painted the transgender symbol on dumpsters, the sidewalk and a step outside the Catholic school off of Route 50. Other spray-painted symbols were found on a fence at the Hampton Inn next to the school, per court records.\nThe symbols were found elsewhere in town, including outside East End Liquors, The Market at Dover Station and other businesses. The transgender symbol, often used to encourage gender inclusivity, is a combination of the male and female signs.\nAt an unusually crowded bail hearing on Monday afternoon, Talbot County District Court Judge Karen Ketterman ordered King to be held without bond in the Detention Center. A trial is scheduled for Oct. 28.\nMany parents and school officials from Sts. Peter and Paul filled the courtroom. School Board Chair Peggy Wilson asked Ketterman to not approve King's release. Wilson cited the Aug. 27 shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, which killed two children and injured 18 people, as a reason why the school community is concerned for the safety of students.\n\"Our fear is not the symbol itself, but the possibility of a copycat situation,\" Wilson said.\nKing, according to public legal representation, is transgender. She previously attended Sts. Peter and Paul School.\nThe Minneapolis shooter, Robin Westman, was referred to as transgender by federal officials. Westman's gender identity wasn't clear, according to The Associated Press.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook said in a statement this weekend that the graffiti incidents are \"especially painful\" given the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting.\n\"It reminds us of the responsibility we all share to ensure our children's safety and well-being,\" Cook wrote. \"We condemn such acts of intimidation, they have no place in our community.\"\nIn a statement Sunday, the Delmarva Pride Center condemned the graffiti acts as a \"misuse\" of the international transgender symbol.\n\"We are deeply troubled that an LGBTQIA+ symbol was misused in a way that could be construed as hateful,\" the statement read. \"Symbols such as the Transgender Symbol exist to affirm identity, celebrate diversity, and foster belonging \u2014 not to spread fear or division.\n\"This incident occurs at a time when Transgender people continue to face targeted attacks in society. We call on our neighbors, allies, and community members to stand together, to reject hate in all its forms, and to embrace the values of acceptance, compassion, and love.\"\nOn Monday, Easton Police Deputy Chief Greg Wright said the agency will increase patrol this week at Sts. Peter and Paul School and other schools in town. He said police \"have no reason to believe that there was any attempt or desire to harm anyone.\"\nBOND DECISION\nBridgette Lane, an assistant at the Talbot County public defender's office, argued in court on Monday that King should be granted release based on the low severity of charges, an otherwise clean criminal record and the Detention Center's recommendation.\nLane said King has \"expressed remorse\" and understands \"she can't be acting out in these ways.\"\nKing, who is listed as having a Baltimore address, was recently staying in Easton with her mother, Lane said. If released, the expectation was for King to stay with her mother.\nTalbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said the graffiti incident is concerning due to the context of the Minneapolis shooting last month, as well as the fact that King's mother's house is close to the school.\n\"Here we have this clear warning sign,\" Coale said. \" ... We don't know if the defendant is capable of carrying out something worse. But the state doesn't want to find out.\"\nKetterman said both sides made good points, but she hammered home that there are \"no conditions of release\" that would ensure the safety of the community. The judge said she's concerned about the location of the graffiti and King's documented mental health diagnoses, which include bipolar disorder and PTSD.\n\"I don't think the court has another choice,\" Ketterman said after ruling no bond and ordering the defendant complete a mental health evaluation.\nInformation from The Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For example, there are very few high rises in Kent County.That works both ways though.\nCity firefighters do not typically have to go into grain or corn silos for rescues. But Kent County firefighters may have to.\nAnd they have the equipment to do it. They are called grain rescue devices and because of a grant, Kennedyville Volunteer Fire Department now has one in addition to the devices already at fire departments in Millington and Rock Hall.\n\"Kent County, Maryland, is noted for a few things,\" retired firefighter Larry Slagle said, speaking for the Chestertown Volunteer Fire Company.\n\"Among those, is our agricultural interests. We have any number of farmers whose primary interest is growing and processing grain products,\" he said. \"And for efficiency, these farmers maintain grain bins, aka silos, on their farms.\"\nSlagle said that occasionally, especially during grain harvest season, personnel may have to enter the silo, perhaps to clear a blockage or discern what the problem may be.\n\"This is one of the most dangerous things they will ever do,\" he added.\nSlagle's post indicated that that the suction of the grain material as it's being unloaded at the bottom, is as dangerous as the riptide or undertow at the ocean.\n\"Across the United States and even the entire world, many farm workers have entered this environmen \u2026 and lost their lives.\"\nFire official experts concur with Slagle and Chestertown fire company, saying that about 55 grain bin entrapment events happen around the United States, many in Midwest states. Farmers and workers can get caught in equipment, submerged in grain or experience a medical event while working.\nThat is why the training with the equipment was instrumental for local firefighters.\nOn July 21, Slagle reported that fire companies from Chestertown, Galena, Betterton, Chestertown, Millington, Rock Hall and Marydel attended a regional training program, hosted by the Kennedyville Volunteer Fire Company with the topic: \"Grain bin emergencies and how to safely mitigate them.\"\nClasses were conducted by members of the National Education Center for Agricultural Safety.\nSlagle said, \"This training is especially invaluable to us, as sometimes emergency responders are sometimes the victims themselves.\"\nAfter a period of classroom discussion, the activity transitioned outside to the training trailer.\nThrough specialized engineering, a grain bin was fashioned, and the \"suction\" phenomenon duplicated, in a safe manner, he pointed out.\nFormer member of the Kennedyville firefighter, farmer and owner of Philips Trucking, Josh Philips said that the equipment is a series of 6-8 aluminum panels, interconnected tubes with an auger, a spiral tool used to drill.\nDuring the training, the tube was placed around the mock accident victim and the auger extracted the grain that was simulating suffocating them.\nFirst responders practiced methods like ropes; confined space operations; patient care and packaging.\n\"At any time during the exercise, should something with the training go sideways, instructors could terminate the process and drain away the grain product,\" Slagle pointed out.\nEverything was conducted safely and first responders left with a sense of confidence in the training, he added.\nKennedyville Assistant Chief Mark Dixon thanked Philips who had nominated Kennedyville for the grant to make the equipment possible.\nSlagle said, \"In the fire service, we have a mantra. 'It is not acceptable for anyone to be injured, or even die, because of training. It's the purpose of training to prevent that very serious, even tragic outcome \u2026 during a real emergency.'\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Phillips described the scene as a \"melee.\"\nPhillips said three sheriff's deputies were spat on and the school safety monitor was taken to the hospital. Two boys, ages 14 and 15, were arrested following the incident.\nThe 15-year-old boy, Jaheem Mortaz Brown, was released to his step-father's custody. Three days later, the Brown allegedly shot his step-father in the face. The extent of the step-father's injuries has not been disclosed.\nIn addition, Phillips said Cambridge police received a call this weekend that juveniles around 11 years old were shoplifting from the Wawa on Sunburst Highway.\n\"They're shoplifting because they know they (the juvenile system) can't do nothing with them,\" Phillips said.\nPhillips said the problem of juvenile crime will continue until the \"broken juvenile justice system\" is changed.\n\"The juvenile justice system in the state of Maryland is broken; it's not working,\" he said. \"We're not holding anybody accountable.\"\nThe former Secretary of the Department of Juvenile Services, Vincent Schiraldi received intense backlash from Mid-Shore sheriffs, including Phillips. The Maryland Sheriffs Association sent a letter to Gov. Wes Moore calling for Schiraldi's immediate resignation last year. Schiraldi stepped down from the position in June.\n\"Consistently in Maryland, juveniles have been charged with serious violent crimes,\" the letter states, \"only to be turned right back over to a parent or guardian, and back out on the streets to commit more crimes.\"\nAfter an in-person community meeting with the secretary around two years ago, Phillips said \"He had the audacity to tell us, 'The data that I'm receiving doesn't support your claim of increased juvenile crime,'\" Phillips recalled. \"And our reply to that was, 'Well, obviously the numbers are going to go down because you're not allowing us to charge (them) anymore.'\"\nIn 2022, the Maryland General Assembly passed a juvenile justice reform bill stressing rehabilitation rather than punishment in addressing juvenile behavioral issues, according to its proponents. The reform took effect in 2024.\nIn August, the Cambridge Police Department presented its quarterly report, which revealed that overall crime decreased, but there were concerns regarding homicides, robberies and juvenile violence.\nHomicides, assaults, larceny and motor vehicle theft all increased from the second quarter in 2024. The homicide rate rose 200%, with two homicides that both led to arrests. One of those homicides was committed by a juvenile.\nPhillips said this level of violent crime in Cambridge is not normal.\n\"I mean, it's not normal anywhere, but I think the biggest contributing factor we had last week is the failure of our juvenile system,\" he said.\nLast school year, students in Dorchester County saw 1,682 long- and short-term suspensions with 1,232 of those suspensions related to violence, according to Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson.\nIn an attempt to curb suspensions, Dorchester County Public Schools launched a violence prevention initiative course for students, teachers, parents and staff to ensure there is community participation. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The sprinkler system activated, limiting fire damage to the room where it started.\nAccording to the Office of the Maryland State Fire Marshal, the fire originated in a rear first-floor office. The preliminary cause was deemed accidental, the result of \"an unspecified electrical event of a power surge protector.\"\nThe fire marshal estimated about $30,000 in structure and content damages. No injuries were reported.\nA total of 36 firefighters responded, with Goodwill Volunteer Fire Company the primary agency in charge. The fire was brought under control in about 30 minutes, the fire marshal said.\nThe fire alarm company contacted 911, and the school custodian also discovered the fire after the alarm activation.\nWater collected in a back hallway, one special education classroom, an office and a conference room as the sprinkler system ran for about 20 minutes, Kibler said.\nThird-party contractors were brought in to evaluate and assist. Normal operations resumed Sept. 11, after the school was closed to students and non-essential personnel Wednesday to allow cleanup and assessment. Other Queen Anne's County Public Schools were not affected.\nQACPS expressed gratitude to first responders, the Queen Anne's County Fire Marshal's Office, the Maryland State Deputy Fire Marshal, and its custodial and maintenance staff for their work in returning the building to use.\nOn its Facebook page, QACPS wrote: \"We are thankful that there were no injuries, and our fire suppression system worked appropriately.\"\nQuestions should be directed to Principal Lou Sheppard, Kibler said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A visit to a foreign country - the past\n\n September 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George F. Will | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 745\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - This nation is awash with heated and ungenerous judgments about its past and about Americans who lived before we ascended to today's sunny uplands of enlightenment.So, for your final summer read, try something tonally different: Drew Gilpin Faust's memoir \"Necessary Trouble: Growing Up at Midcentury.\" It concerns not her presidency of Harvard from 2007 to 2018 but her coming of age in the 1950s and 1960s.She was a high-octane student activist, involved in dangerous civil rights campaigning in the Deep South before becoming hyper-active in agitating against U.S. involvement in Vietnam.She is, however, an accomplished historian, and her book is most interesting, and needed, as a mellow, humane acceptance of an enduring truth from a forgotten novel (by L.P. Hartley): \"The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.\" Faust has gone back to a foreign country - America when post-1945 conventions and complacencies began to crumble - and has returned with a needed gift for today's nation: an example of mature assessment.Faust was born into a prosperous family in the caste system of segregated Virginia, a society thick with \"rules and roles\" governing - actually, suffocating - young white women and all Black people. They were entrapped, in not altogether dissimilar ways, in the viscosity of a society defined by strict racial and gender expectations that were unarticulated because they were unquestioned.Six decades ago, two braided emancipations began, the emancipation of women, and of Blacks nearly a century after the Emancipation Proclamation.Faust's family rode to hounds and sent children north to tony prep schools and universities. But from an early age, Faust was intelligent, opinionated, inexhaustibly curious, a voracious reader - and disconcerting to her determinedly conventional mother.A high school counselor would write of \"Mrs. Gilpin's bewilderment in connection with Drewdie's intellectual gifts.\" Drew's mother \"is like a hen that has hatched a duckling and cannot understand having a daughter who is not going to be a 'Southern belle.'\" Faust would not be - as that era expressed its aspiration - \"well-adjusted.\" Least of all adjusted to a society in which the chivalric protection of women was, Faust writes, \"inextricably tied to concessions of frailty and incapacity.\" Young Drew was immersed \"in a man's world and a white world.\" She sensed the connection and set about causing what John Lewis, the civil rights leader and congressman, called \"necessary trouble.\" In the decade when Black author Ralph Ellison published his great novel \"Invisible Man\" (1952), Life magazine reflected national perceptions and assumptions.\"With the exception of a butler serving a drink on a silver tray,\" everyone pictured in Life's 1950s advertisements was White, and working women - other than in Hollywood - also were mostly invisible.Faust relished rock music, which was saturated with sexuality - Pat Boone and Frankie Avalon elbowed aside by Elvis and Little Richard - but books were most catalyzing.The 36 volumes published before 1960 about an independent and resourceful 16-year-old, Nancy Drew, were formative also for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Nancy Pelosi, Sandra Day O'Connor and others.Faust \"had never, at least as far as I knew, met a Jewish person\" when she met, through a diary, an adolescent who was \"an avid reader and aspiring writer,\" Anne Frank.Scout, the 8-year-old daughter of Atticus Finch in \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" exemplified for Faust children \"seeing clearly.\" Faust writes, \"These girls who dared - Nancy, Anne, Scout - were daring me.\" So, she went to Mississippi in 1964 for Freedom Summer, to Selma and Birmingham in 1965, this daughter whose father's car once had a hood ornament of Robert E. Lee mounted on Traveller.Faust, an academic who perhaps has not spent enough time around people who disagree with her about important matters, is uncharacteristically intemperate when she denigrates Vice President Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic 1968 presidential nominee, as a \"toady\" because he did not \"speak out\" against the war.Faust was 10 months old when Humphrey, the 37-year-old mayor of Minneapolis, successfully provoked the Democrats' 1948 national convention to put a civil rights plank in the party's platform.By challenging the upholders of Jim Crow - Southern Democratic governors and legislators - Humphrey ignited necessary trouble, which Faust would later join.Faust usually judges the past without rancor, contempt or preening, giving empathetic depictions of social contexts inherited by the people who inhabited them.When, generations hence, historians judge how we inhabited our context, they will be depicting the foreign country to which we then will be confined: the past.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nDrew Faust clasps hands with a graduate as she walks in the procession at Harvard's commencement ceremony in 2013 where she was university president. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Vicki Wilson, secretary of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society, introduced Bernier.\"Celeste is the Professor and Chair of United States and Atlantic Studies at University Edinburgh in Scotland,\" Wilson said. \"She is an author and world-renowned historian.\"Anna Murray was born free in Denton.Early in her relationship with Frederick Douglass, who was enslaved when Anna was free, she gave him all of her savings to run away to his freedom. He refused.When she told him she loved him and that he could return the money later, he finally agreed. He escaped and eventually returned the money. They got married in New York City in 1838.\"She lived her life by the conviction that her home was the council chamber of the free,\" said Bernier. Anna, working as an agent of the Underground Railroad, fed hundreds of people, day or night.She worked with Harriet Tubman on the Eastern Shore, said Bernier.In his writings, Frederick Douglass relates a story about a woman from Easton, who came to them for help.\"This poor woman's back and shoulders had been literally hacked to pieces,\" he said. \"Three months ago, her cheek was branded with burning irons. We sat with her, and all she said was 'I want to get to Canada.'\" Bernier, working from original source documents, delivered a lecture on Murray-Douglass with descriptions like, \"freedom fighter,\" \"revolutionary liberator\" and \"human rights philosopher.\"Anna did not just sit in her kitchen baking biscuits.According to Bernier, Anna was an expert cook and could whip up everything from dishes from the African diaspora to European styles of cuisine. There were a lot of hungry people to feed, and at times she had to ask her own family to sacrifice food and a warm bed for someone else.She was interested in how fashion could reflect a person's wholeness. She designed a silk plum colored wedding dress for herself in 1830 in New York City. Anna worked tirelessly to help newly emancipated slaves by feeding them and giving them dignified clothes.Anna knew the power of printing and publishing her own story. This control of her own representation was crucial. Her descendants knew this too and wrote to make the abolitionist cause manifest.Bernier called Anna an \"egalitarian human rights philosopher.\" And she raised her five children to carry on this fight against white supremacy.\"They took that intergenerational pain, that intergenerational trauma, that inter-generations suffering, and they turned it into intergenerational liberation, intergenerational activism and a blueprint for what a world based on equal human rights would actually look like,\" Bernier said.Bernier said it is hard to estimate how many slaves Anna set free. One estimate is 1,200, but Bernier wonders if it is much higher.The historian painted a picture of Anna as Frederick's equal and protector.She said Frederick had a way with words, and Anna had a way with numbers.Anna was always on the move to avoid persecution and to keep her husband safe, but the cause of liberty echoed loudly in the Douglass' homes. Their final home was on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. They bought it with her money.When Anna dies in 1882, 3,000 people attended her funeral.After Bernier's lecture, there was time for questions and mingling with coffee.The historian signed copies of her book \"If I Survive,\" which was also authored by Andrew Taylor.Bernier opened her laptop to share images of the Douglass family with some of the abolitionists' living relatives, who came to the lecture.One descendent, Thelma Nichols of Denton, is a spry 97. She shared stories that her father had told her.\"It is exciting to know that I am a relative of someone as important as Anna,\" said Deborah Murray-Dates of Cambridge, Anna's greatniece.\"Incredible.\"The Douglasses had five children.

    "content": "King's granddaughter carrying forward his legacy\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JESSICA A. JOHNSON | Section: Columns \n \n 673\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I happened to catch the recent \"CBS Mornings\" news interview of Yolanda Renee King, the only grandchild of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. While promoting her new children's book honoring her grandparents titled \"We Dream a World,\" Yolanda gave a profound answer when asked what she would say to them if they were alive today. \"I think I would first start off with an apology,\" she said, which was surprising to CBS host Nate Burleson, who immediately asked the young activist what she meant by her response. Yolanda continued, \"An apology to where we are right now, as a nation and really as a world.\"Yolanda is only 15 years old, and it is evident that she has a deep understanding of what her grandparents fought for as leaders of the civil rights movement. In August of last year, during the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, Yolanda boldly declared that her generation would \"be defined by action, not apathy.\"\nAs Yolanda is growing up before our eyes, she has the youthful exuberance of her grandfather's resolve and displays the dignified grace of her grandmother. Yolanda saying she would apologize to her grandparents for our nation not yet reaching the potential they believed in should make us thoughtfully reflect on how Dr. King also warned about becoming apathetic.\nApathy is a brutal paralyzer of life. It can cause us to be ensnared in a dangerous mode of stagnation emotionally, spiritually, and sometimes physically. Apathy also triggers entitled disinterest in our society. In 2021, Tom Nichols, an instructor at Harvard Extension School and the U.S. Naval War College, asserted in an interview with The Harvard Gazette that \"narcissism and nihilism\" are the primary threats to our country's democracy and societal relationships. Elaborating on the latter, Nichols said that many people ask why our society is \"so mean and heartless and awful,\" but many of them do not contribute anything to make their communities better, or they will vote against policies that affect their well-being due to \"narcissistic beefs.\"\n\"We have become surly villagers,\" Nichols maintained, \"me, my family, my little plot of land, and everybody else can go to hell.\" This type of sullen attitude is what Yolanda is urging our country to overcome as she is an emerging voice on critical issues such as gun violence and homelessness.\nAs Yolanda continues to attentively study the Godly principles that enabled her grandfather to be that drum major for justice who changed the course of our nation, I am reminded of two of his sermons where he encouraged his followers to live with purpose and passion and to shower others with Christian love.\nThe first sermon is titled \"But If Not,\" a 1967 message that King delivered at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church. King expresses that the \"ultimate test\" of our faith is when we get to a \"but if not\" moment in life, a moment where we have to travel along an arduous journey with no other option but to lean on God's promises.\nThis passage stands out to avoid being gripped by apathy during a spiritual test: \"... somewhere along the way [in life] you should discover something that's so dear, so precious to you, that is so eternally worthful, that you will never give it up.\" The second sermon is \"Levels of Love,\" an Ebenezer address King gave in 1962. He implored the congregation to \"rise to agape, to Christian love\" because \"[t]he greatness of it is that you love every man, not for your sake but for his sake. And you love every man because God loves him.\"\nIt is remarkable that Yolanda exemplifies the love and compassion her grandparents demonstrated as she diligently works to uplift others. She is blazing her own path, and it is truly inspiring to watch it unfold. She probably has not had a \"but if not\" moment yet in her young life thus far, but I have no doubt she is developing the character and strength to face the challenges she knows are coming. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore to be on the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture. His term is from 2023 to 2027.According to MCAAH website, the purpose of the \"the commission is to identify and preserve buildings, communities and sites of historical and cultural importance to the African American experience in Maryland. This competitive program, offered once per year, is supported through an annual appropriation from the Maryland General Assembly and is administered as a joint partnership of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture and The Maryland Historical Trust.\"\nThey give away $5 million a year, and Moaney works with his commission to find suitable candidates who are either architecturally or culturally preserving Black history and identity.\n\"It is the first ever ethnic commission in the United States. It is something that our colleagues across the country look to as an example. I feel humble to join the group as the youngest. The commission, in general, documents, collects African American heritage across the state,\" said Moaney.\nHe covers Delmarva for the commission and currently lives in Cambridge with his wife. Moaney is a product of Talbot County Public Schools, where he played football. He went to Williams College in Massachusetts.\nMoaney said he hopes to energize the commission.\n\"I am trying to expand notions of Blackness that center on joy, that center freedom, agency and maybe push and highlight elements of our culture here on the Shore that often get overlooked. I think we have to reinforce accurate portrayals of Black life as well as ones that normalize our culture,\" he said.\nHe takes a long historical look at how Black people have suffered in America.\n\"Our country is really trying to reconcile with wounds that haven't fully healed or even the past few weeks, some that are opening up scars that are deeper than we could imagine. Like the people of Haiti, who have a large population in Salisbury now, or the people who were elected in Federalsburg for the first time in centuries \u2014 have the space to give it justice,\" he said.\nMoaney will bring the commission to Chestertown for a public meeting in April. That meeting will be in the Bethel AME Church, where the Freedom Riders came and stayed in 1962.\n\"We have regular commission meetings that will happen all over the state. It is a beauty to be at the sites we are trying to preserve. Some are trying to be restored, some have been restored, some are receiving grants,\" Moaney said.\n\"I was assigned two committees. One was African American Heritage Preservation Program. The funding for that just got raised by the assembly from $1 million to $5 million. Close to 50% of the awardees were on the Eastern Shore. It is a collaboration with the Maryland Historical Trust which is in the Department of Planning,\" he said.\nAmong the grants awarded by the commission through the Historical Preservation Program for fiscal year 2024 are:\n$250,000 for the American Legion Mannie Scott Post 193 Building in Denton.\n$138,000 to Alpha Genesis Community Development Corporation in Cambridge.\n$200,000 to Kent County Public Library.\n$250,000 to Bryan's United Methodist Church in Grasonville.\n$250,000 to the Mid-Shore Community Foundation in Royal Oak.\nThe grants will offer assistance to organizations and private citizens in their sponsorship of projects involving the acquisition, construction, or improvement of sites related to African American heritage, according to a press release from the governor's office.\nMoaney's other appointment is to the Inaugural Statewide Book Drive. \"The best part are the oral histories. There are so many discoveries. It's a privilege to be there,\" he said.\nOutside of his work on the commission, Moaney is the founder of literacy group called the Needle's Eye Academy.\n\"If you are familiar with Gil Scott-Heron. He was arguably the soundtrack to the Black power movement as a poet and a musician and an oralist. The song 'Needles Eye' is where the Academy's name emanates from. From the 1972 album 'Pieces of the Man,'\" he said.\n\"They have been asking, 'Are there any college age students who will speak to high schoolers and maybe even start a book club. We donated our old book sales into Berkshire County Public Schools (Massachusetts). In August of 2020 we started online in Talbot County Public Schools with three wonderful students.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Woodson founded what is now the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. The following year, he began publishing what is now The Journal of African American History, a publication of history, research and book reviews.\nIn 1926, Woodson founded \"Negro History Week\" to honor the history, culture and contributions of African Americans. He chose February to coincide with the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln. In 1976, President Gerald Ford extended the observation to a month, now known as Black History Month.\nWoodson believed that history was \"made by the people, not simply or primarily by great men.\"\nLocal writer, Niambi Davis had the opportunity to contribute to the Black History display at Bethel AME. The subjects, Davis said, \"are important and more than just the usual Douglass and Tubman stories; they're the unknown local, national and international folks.\"\nThe display is open to the congregation and anyone wishing to attend services. Service begins at 11 a.m. Sunday mornings.

    "content": "Lawmakers propose task force to probe long-term inequities facing Black women\n\n February 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TORRENCE BANKS Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 817\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON \u2014 The persistence of economic, educational and legal disparities in the lives of Black women and girls would be the target of a federal task force recently proposed by a group of House members.\"Simply acknowledging our country's history of targeted discrimination, harassment and violence against Black women and girls will not correct years of systemic racism and sexism,\" Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Illinois) said in a statement after the legislation creating the task force was introduced earlier this month.\n\"We must leverage the full weight of the federal government to seek justice for Black women and girls who deserve an equal opportunity for a full, happy, healthy life,\" Kelly said.\nKelly is co-chair of the Caucus on Black Women and Girls, along with Reps. Yvette Clarke of New York and Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, who also sponsored the measure. Reps. Jennifer McClellan (D-Virginia), Valerie Foushee (D-North Carolina) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pennsylvania) also have signed on to the bill, called the \"Protect Black Women and Girls Act.\"\nThe bill would establish a task force to examine several aspects of the lives of Black women and girls, including education, healthcare, economic development, housing and civil rights. The task force would look at the effectiveness of programs and policies at the state, federal and local levels and make recommendations for changes.\nKelly said that the bill would help governments be more proactive in ensuring that Black women receive equal opportunities.\nThe task force would be led by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice. Both would then share information with the United States Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR).\nThe civil rights commission also would conduct a study and collect data about the social justice, economic and health effects of discrimination and inequities on Black women and girls. The bill was originally introduced in 2021 with 15 co-sponsors. However, Congress took no action on it.\nMaryland Del. Jheanelle Wilkins, a Democrat, said the legislation would allow the state's government to look at the results from the research and craft more equitable policies.\n\"We know that signs point to black women being disproportionately impacted by many things whether it's maternal health \u2014 and in Maryland, Black women are four times as likely to die as a result of childbirth,\" said Wilkins, who also serves as the chair of the state's Legislative Black Caucus.\nIn 2021, the maternal mortality rate of non-Hispanic Black women was 69.9 births per 100,000 live births, according to the Centers for Disease Control. That was more than two times the rate for non-Hispanic white women.\n\"We are the caregivers for our community, we're the matriarchs of our home, but also of the Black community,\" said Kelli Richardson Lawson, founder of the mental health nonprofit organization The SonRise Project, based in Bethesda, Maryland. \"So we've always had to take care of everybody else before we take care of ourselves.\"\nLawson said that the passage of the legislation is crucial because of the socioeconomic challenges that Black women have faced.\nThirty-nine percent of white women earn a bachelor's or associate degree by the age of 29, compared to 21% of Black women, according to the American Association of University Women.\n\"Based on what I've seen, this bill would help mitigate some of the issues that we see involving Black women and girls in a variety of areas,\" said Lawson, whose non-profit serves as a safe space for Black parents to discuss issues involving teen mental health.\nBlack girls also face disadvantages in education. A 2020-2021 school discipline report from the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights found that \"Black girls were nearly two times more likely to receive one or more in-school suspensions, one or more out-of-school suspensions, and expulsions than White girls.\"\nIn addition, Black school-aged girls are four times more likely to be arrested in school than white girls, according to research discussed on Kelly's web page.\nJohn Berkley, coordinator for the National Pan-Hellenic Council in Maryland, Virginia and several other states, said that Maryland has many organizations working to help Black women. Knowing that Congress is backing them up with legislation would be a huge boost, he said.\n\"Now they could say that It's not only a community effort but also a national policy that we now have some teeth behind,\" Berkley said. \"And maybe with that, that will bring more awareness to what's going on with Black females in our various raised communities.\"\nBerkley said that he plans to travel with his fraternity to Annapolis in a couple of weeks to talk to his legislators to see what they're doing to help Congress move the bill along.\nLawson said the task force could lead to the creation of more programs and organizations like hers, where Black women are free to focus on themselves and have vulnerable conversations.\n\"Changing the narrative, so that we can take off that cape, we can take a deep breath and exhale, and we can start to focus on ourselves,\" Lawson said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The location where James Taylor, a 23-year-old Black man, was lynched in 1892.That soil would find its way more than 800 miles south in a powerful message to remember a bleak chapter in history.\nThat journey was followed in the documentary film \"Get on the Bus.\"\nForty-two Kent County youths and adults made the trek, traveling to Civil Rights era landmarks in Alabama and Georgia, including the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; the King Center in Atlanta, Edmund Pettus Bridge and the National Voting Rights Museum in Selma and the Equal Justice Initiative's Community Remembrance Project in Montgomery.\nDirected by Justinian Dispenza of Andover Media, the film debuted on Valentine's Day at the Decker Theatre in Washington College with almost 200 people in attendance. it was also shown the at Ocean City Film Festival earlier this month.\nAfter its debut, the powerful emotions it invoked resulted in people interested in screening it.\nFor Dispenza, it's uplifting to see his work yielding these results.\n\"That's what we're all aiming to do as filmmakers. To make a change in people's lives. It was an incredible experience,\" he said.\nAs people left the theatre, Dispenza reflected on the process of creating \"Get on the Bus\" in slight awe.\nBecause it did not start out as being a film.\nThe idea initially came from Program Director of Minary's Dream Alliance Paul Tue III and Co-Chair of the James Taylor Justice Coalition Philip Dutton, to take a trip, educating people about the past, to the roots of the Civil Rights Movement, Alabama.\nWhat started as a field trip where Dispenza was brought on to take pictures became something else.\nDispenza, no stranger to films about social issues, was eager.\nExcept there were obstacles.\nBefore they left, he was diagnosed with Lyme's Disease. Forced to take antibiotics on the road, he was told by his doctor to avoid the sun.\n\"That's kinda tough to do, July in the Deep South,\" Dispenza said, laughing.\nIt was five days in that sweltering heat with cameras rolling 24-7, no cloud in sight.\nWhile he and Lead Editor Tanner Presswood filmed, Dispenza used long sleeves like protective gear and a floppy hat to ward off the sun.\nPerhaps if he didn't feel a strong sense of purpose, he would have thought of his discomfort more than three times in the trip. But seeing through the lens of time how racism was a way of life for many, which seemed like a different universe to him, busied him in a beneficial way.\nThey went to sites like the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, where on Sunday, September 15, 1963, at 10:22 a.m., the church became known around the world when a bomb exploded, killing four young girls attending Sunday School.\nEastern Shore girls the age of those victims read that and marveled.\n\"How can someone hate someone so much that they could hurt them and have no consideration in their heart?\" Love Jackson asked.\nAs they ascended the steps to the upper part of the church they witnessed a reenactment of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.\nOvercome by the strong feelings standing where King stood, Pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Chestertown Joel Tolbert opened up.\n\"I sit in the pulpit every Sunday. But I tried to stand in that pulpit...it's a hard space,\" he acknowledged.\nThe emotions would heighten.\nJust down the road there were statues of attack dogs, replicas of what Black people faced in 1963. There was a statue of children against the wall in a firing line and statues of enslaved people in chains, heads down in despair.\nBroadcasted at the The National Memorial for Peace and Justice were some of the reasons they were lynched, horrific in their simplicity and ignorance.\nOne was lynched for not tipping his hat to the police officer.\nAnother to yield a better return in the sharecropping business.\nThere was one, where, since a man could not be found, his 2-year-old daughter was lynched in his place.\nThe group journeyed to Selma. At the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they crossed as others did in 1965, knowing that beatings, dogs and water hoses waited for them on the other side.\nFounder of Minary's Dream Alliance, Doncella Wilson, felt that weight. Crossing the same bridge that 600 Civil Rights marchers crossed, she had to stop in the middle and reflect, before walking on., head high.\nThe camera captured the moment.\nInside the Equal Justice Initiative Museum while delivering the soil as an addition to the Legacy Museum, Dispenza broke down himself.\nHe sat on the floor and cried, having taken some ownership of the atrocities committed. But through that pain and despair, the tears and sorrow, shone hope.\n\"People were not afraid to be vulnerable,\" Dispenza said. \"It led to healing.\"\nThey were receptive to the filming process too, seeing it as a tool to do good. \"It was a tough film but a beautiful film,\" Dispenza said.\nAnd the results of the film did not leave people in despair.\nOne resident leaving Decker Theatre told him the film \"had given him a peace and hope he's never had before.\"\nThroughout the film there were positive messages to the youth. Wilson told a group of children the activists they have read about and heard were no older than they were. Tue told the youths they don't know how powerful they are.\nDispenza's film echoed with its audience as well. After the debut, it has been featured at the Bill Johnson Film Festival in Indiana.\nTue, who was with them through the entire trip, was amazed at how the footage was compiled altogether.\nHe told Dispenza, \"My God, this is going places!\"\nWith eight or nine screenings already having taken place, he was certainly not wrong.\nDispenza sees this as an urgent message to spread. \"This conversation needs to be had as school districts try to suppress Critical Race Theory,\" he said.\nIt is a topic debated among educational groups. Dispenza is more than happy to pursue these challenges and encouraged those who have great story ideas to reach out to him at Andover Media.\nFor more of his projects, visit his Imdb page at imdb.com/name/nm14340956/ as well. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The state's attorney's office released the information Friday afternoon.According to charging documents filed by the Maryland State Police, the students displayed swastikas, made Nazi salutes and directed offensive comments to a classmate because of the classmate's religious beliefs.\nThe state's attorney's office press release stated the behavior began last December and \"continued over several months despite repeated requests to stop.\"\nThe matter was reported to the state police, who investigated and filed the charges against the juveniles. The press release does not report the names or genders of the charged students.\nThe charges will be forwarded to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services for appropriate action. That entity has the discretion to refer the charges to the Calvert County Circuit Court for a hearing. The state's attorney's office then would be required to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\"Calvert County Public Schools is committed to providing students and staff with an environment that is safe, welcoming and free from all forms of discrimination,\" Susan Johnson, chief academic officer and spokesperson for the school system, said in a statement released Monday. \"The civil rights of all individuals will be protected. All complaints are investigated promptly. Upon completion of an investigation, students and school personnel may be subject to disciplinary action or consequences for discriminatory behaviors.\"\nCalvert County State's Attorney Robert Harvey (R) issued a statement last Friday.\n\"Maryland was founded on the principle of religious toleration,\" Harvey said in the statement. \"It is frankly astonishing that nearly 400 years later some people continue to persecute others based upon their religion. I call upon parents, educators and community and faith leaders to make sure that our children know that religious persecution has no place in our society.\"\nOn Tuesday, Commissioner President Earl F. \"Buddy\" Hance (R) stated, \"We will not tolerate hate speech. That's not who we are. I hope they [juveniles] get the counseling that they need.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We had a lot of older generations that had a lot of knowledge of what happened and it was never told to the kids, so the kids never knew what was going on.\"\nThe event also included exhibits featuring historical and cultural institutions, authors, quilts and poetry.\n\"They're amazing. They're just so detailed,\" St. Mary's College North Campus Area Coordinator Meghan Pushee said as she gazed at story quilts. \"I love the collage aspect and the multi-media aspect. I'm in awe of them.\"\nLater, speakers took to the stage at the Nancy R. & Norton T. Dodge Performing Arts Center on campus.\n\"Now, more than ever we must expand this history in your voice, from your memory, from your attics, from your archives,\" Southern Maryland Equity in History Coalition Hugh Davies said. \"Let us commit to doing so to bring this history forward.\"\nThe event was dedicated to longtime Calvert County NAACP officer Malcolm Funn, who died in 2022.\n\"It has been said that before we can travel forward or even truly understand why we're here today, one must understand the past,\" Piscataway Conoy Tribe Tribal Chairman Francis Gray said. \"History is our willingness to connect the past to the present. It provides us with a sense of purpose, of who we are, a sense of being \u2026 and it's here that we all have the opportunity to obtain that knowledge. The Piscataway Conoy people are excited to have this opportunity to unearth the narrative of Maryland's history.\"\nSt. Mary's College Community Affairs Liaison Kelsey R. Bush read the land acknowledgement and pledge, while Southern Maryland Equity in History Coalition Steering Committee member Janice Walthour read her poem, \"Ancestors.\"\n\"My mother used to tell my sister and me, 'Actions speak louder than words.' She would also say, 'Beauty is as beauty does,' and today is beautiful,\" said author, performer, GU272+ descendent and keynote speaker M\u00e9lisande Short-Colomb. \"More information and more stories about Native American history and African American history will be unveiled. The ancestry and history of all \u2026 will be accessible to all. Our ancestors would be proud.\"\n\"Since all stories start at the beginning, we have started by working directly with the Piscataway people to see if this was a story they would trust to be told,\" Southern Maryland National Heritage Area Executive Director Lucille Walker said. \"That's why this particular initiative is so critical. Because why are we telling any stories if we're not telling the whole story? If we're not doing it for the next generation then what are we doing?\"\nThe coalition, which is administered by \"Big Conversation: Partners in Dismantling Racism and Privilege in Southern Maryland,\" which was started at Middleham and St. Peter's Episcopal Parish in Lusby, and is supported by public school systems, libraries, museums, colleges and churches.\nSt. Mary's College President Tuajuanda Jordan said the coalition \"is a testament to the realization that we have work to do to create and sustain an inclusive community free of racism and prejudice.\"\nFor more information or to see the new website, go to www.equityinhistory.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Eighteen volleys of musket fire.\nThe men fought for the Union. They fought for freedom. Their freedom.\nThe 18 were Black Union soldiers who fought in the Civil War. They are buried in the cemetery behind St. Stephens AME Church in Unionville, the town named to honor their fight for freedom.\n\"Hearing the names is the best part,\" Pamela Roberts Price said. She has relatives in the graveyard.\nAround 70 people gathered at St. Stephens on a recent Sunday. There was a contingent of Union-garbed men with rifles, flags and shiny brass buckles.\nThe sounds of \"Amazing Grace\" drifted over gravestones that are worn by thousands of rainy days. A solo violin played \"Taps.\"\nSt. Stephens Pastor Eddie Scott opened the ceremony with a prayer. \"Comfort us in knowing that these soldiers that we stand on their shoulders, that we can have life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"\nHarriette Lowery has more than 10 relatives in the cemetery.\n\"I am related to one of the soldiers, definitely,\" she said. \"Benjamin Demby is my great-great-grandfather. My grandfather's mother was Agnes Demby Green. That was Benjamin's mother.\"\nLike Price, Lowery loves hearing the names.\n\"Every time I hear the names it gives me such pride,\" she said. \"Thinking about the chaos that is happening in our community or somewhere else, thinking about what they did, what they went through really touches me.\"\nShe noted that there were no promises to these soldiers.\n\"They did it hoping they would be free,\" Lowery said. \"They hoped they would get emancipation.\"\nShe noted some of the local Black soldiers traveled as far as Texas, and some of them had to walk from Texas to get home.\n\"I want the history to be told over and over again because not only do our young people, all races of young people, need to know what they went through,\" Lowery said. \"They sacrificed for us to do better. So don't give up on education and things like that. They need to know what people sacrificed.\"\nDan Cowgill of Middletown was master of ceremonies for the event. His ancestors were Quakers who donated the land for Unionville where freed slaves settled after the Civil War.\n\"We are honoring the 18 soldiers from the U.S. colored troops during the Civil War that created the town of Unionville,\" he said. \"It is amazing I still get choked up when I read these words.\"\nThe African American history within 10 miles of St. Stephens Church is remarkable. Not all of it is known or even written about. Sandy Johnson is working to change that.\n\"I am a budding historic preservationist,\" she said. \"It is good to honor those that came before us. It gives us a direction to know where we are going in life. Without the past you really can't move forward.\"\nThere were white participants in the crowd whose roots go way back too. Some of their relatives had owned big estates. Some have tilled this land for generations. A few got together to swap stories and show old black and white photographs. You could hear them saying old names too.\nThe Green Meadows Bluegrass Band finished playing \"Amazing Grace,\" the sounds of the music falling softly on the worn gravestones marked with the names of the Union soldiers \u2014 John Blackwell, Ennels Clayton, Isaac Copper, John Copper, Benjamin Demby, Charles Demby, William Doane, William Doran, Horace Gibson, Zachary Glasgow, Joseph Gooby, Joseph H.

    "content": "Nause-Waiwash aim to preserve, uncover history of Native Americans from Dorchester County\n\n August 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 567\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Since 1989, the Nause-Waiwash Band of Indians have preserved, honored and passed down the stories of their ancestors, many of whom were Nanticoke people living along the Choptank River.Chief Donna Wolf Mother Abbott is the band's leader. The group preserves the tradition of the indigenous people who fled in the 1700s to the marshes after being converged on by foreign settlers.\nAbbott's passion for exploring the county's native history began when she enrolled in the Nause-Waiwash around 20 years ago, though she wasn't always dead set on joining.\n\"There were probably two, three, maybe four generations that were brought up believing that it was disgraceful to claim your heritage, so they didn't teach it to their children,\" Abbott said. \"And my grandmother was one of those.\"\nAbbott's cousins convinced her to enroll around 10 years before she became the band's second chief in 2014, following the death of former Chief Sewell Winterhawk Fitzhugh.\n\"They brought up a very good point, and that was, 'If you don't (join), how are we going to preserve the history?'\" Abbott recalled her cousins telling her. \"'Because it's fading, it's dying quickly. And what are you going to tell your grandchildren?'\"\nThe Nause-Waiwash is made up of around 300 descendants of not just the Nanticoke, but Choptank and Pocomoke people as well. Nause was a Nanticoke village outside of Vienna and Waiwash a Choptank village outside of Cambridge, Abbott said.\nIt's a \"matrilineal society,\" one where the women hold the power to elect a chief and make important decisions. At meetings, the nonprofit organization plans upcoming events and collaborations with other tribes in the state, along with discussing heritage and history.\nTwo churches \u2014 Hughes African Methodist Episcopal Chapel near Cambridge and Wesley Chapel south of Cambridge in Andrews \u2014 are being renovated so the Nause-Waiwash can provide services and have a resource center. The organization is hosting its 32nd annual Native American Festival on Sept. 14 in Vienna.\nSuch outreach events are meant to educate people on the history of who occupied Dorchester land, but also how Native Americans treated the land and surrounding waters.\nUNCOVERING HISTORYDespite living on the Western Shore, Erin Kennedy, a member of the Nause-Waiwash, often combs through records and land deeds in and around Taylor's Island, the community in which she grew up, hoping to piece together her mother's side of the family.\nShe took inspiration from her uncle, who created a family tree for her father's side of the family.\nOnline resources, records from the Maryland State Archives and discussions with fellow indigenous descendants on the Eastern Shore have helped Kennedy and other members of the Nause-Waiwash understand their line of ancestors.\nAbbott emphasized that she's learning every day as well. She's uncertain if permanent state recognition is in the Nause-Waiwash's future given that it's not quite as large as other tribes. However, recent recognitions such as a historical roadside marker next to the Choptank River have raised the prominence of the dedicated nonprofit's work.\nNearly 10 years in, Abbott is developing a love and commitment to the work of the Nause-Waiwash.\n\"I have this passion for it, which I never really knew I had until I became involved,\" Abbott said. \"And I do know that a lot of our history is gone. I want to read all these books and see if I can't find some new information out that I don't know. So I'm reading books that I'd never thought I'd ever read before.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The next day, another window was broken. The day after that, someone broke her back door and her back windows. They stole her son's football trophy.It wasn't just Speed. Two other houses on her street had windows and doors broken. That's unusual for the neighborhood established in the late 1800s, Speed says. Until recently, residents all lived in peace, without fear of crime.\nSo Speed, the unofficial matriarch of Turner Station, decided to get to work.\n\"I did not feel that spirit from God to get the police,\" she said in an interview on July 24. \"So now we are trying to work with the children of new families that have moved to historic Turner station.\"\nOn Saturday, she held an event to educate new residents about the neighborhood's history. It started with a service inside the dimly lit Union Baptist Church.\nJaBrea Rodgers presided over much of the service and told about a dozen attendees about her great-grandmother, Henrietta Lacks, whose \"immortal cells\" helped a Johns Hopkins Hospital researcher study cancer cures.\nLacks moved to Turner Station in 1941 so her husband could work at the nearby Bethlehem Steel plant. She was hospitalized with cervical cancer, and a surgeon removed her cells and sent them to Dr. George Gey, the researcher. He shipped the cells to Philadelphia, Speed said. When the cells returned, they were still living \u2014 in fact, they had multiplied.\nHer cells still live.\nAfter the service finished, Speed led the small crowd to the headquarters of her movement, Save the Nation of Turner Station, at 411 Main St., where tables, chairs and a vendor selling watermelon pieces and chips awaited them.\nBill Barry, a retired labor studies professor at the Community College of Baltimore County, Dundalk, held a lecture about Turner Station and Bethlehem Steel, which employed many residents during its heyday.\nThen Andrew Morton, who worked at Bethlehem Steel in the blast furnace smelting metals, reminisced to the the dozen-strong crowd about his time \u2014 the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\"OSHA didn't come into the plant until 1974,\" he said. \"Every other week, somebody was getting killed or maimed. Three or four of my buddies that went down there with me are not here today. They got killed on the blast furnace.\"\nAlong with educating new residents, Speed worked to raise money for the revitalization of the somewhat blighted Turner Station. She's asking 1 billion people to donate $1 to the cause.\nIn previous years, Barry said, the event had a much larger turnout and included horses, games and kids. Speed said the organizers didn't have time to distribute flyers to the new neighbors, the rainy forecast gave many pause and the horses were unable to come because of the collapsed Key Bridge.\nStill, Speed called the event a success.\n\"Put us down, Lord willing, for next year. If we are gone, the next generation that was here, we have asked them to come on,\" she said. \"So we're going to replicate, repair and repurpose.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is now on display in his office. That rug includes 99 names of God in Arabic. Rabbi Hyman views it as a metaphorical bridge connecting people of different faiths.\nHe once asked the leaders of a mosque if they could help him translate some of the Arabic words on his rug. They did so, amazed that such an inclusive rug was owned and displayed by a rabbi.\nFor Rabbi Hyman, it was simply his belief that \"building relationships not only creates friendships, but they also cement ties.\"\nA partial list of his local efforts to improve the quality of life in our community and beyond, includes serving as a member, program vice president and president of the Talbot Association of Clergy and Laity. He received an Award of Appreciation for Outstanding and Inspiring Interfaith Work in Talbot County for a Temple B'nai Israel February Lecture Series: \"Introduction to Islam.\"\nHe was a recipient of the NAACP Dorothy Webb Black Community Service Legacy Award and a recipient of a Governor William Donald Schaefer Helping People Award. He was a member of The Frederick Douglass Celebration Committee and delivered the sermon at the Community Interfaith Worship Celebration, which was a part of the \"Douglass Returns\" statue dedication.\nAn author and teacher, he served as a presenter and instructor at Chesapeake College's Institute for Adult Learning and collaborated with Bishop Joel Marcus Johnson to launch a \"Downtown Lunch and Learn\" program. He was elected to the board of directors at the YMCA of the Chesapeake and appointed chair of the board at the Easton YMCA.\nSupport for Scouting has been a huge part of Rabbi Hyman's life since he earned his Eagle Scout award, as did his two sons. That is an achievement that has been earned by only 6% of all Scouts since 1912.\nHe has served as a scoutmaster and a chaplain at Scout World Jamborees in Thailand, England, Sweden and Japan and a National Jamboree in the United States. He was the first national chair for the Messengers of Peace Program, BSA, after having served as a national chair of the Jewish Committee on Scouting and as national Jewish chaplain \u2014 Boy Scouts of America. He was the keynote speaker at a national annual meeting of the BSA \"Duty to God Breakfast\" in Washington, D.C.\nHe is a recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award for distinguished service to youth awarded by the National Council of Boy Scouts of America. He is also a recipient of the Bronze Wolf Award, which is the Scouts' highest honor. It is presented by the World Scout Committee to recognize the service, commitment and contributions of volunteers to the Scout movement. Not surprisingly Hyman received the award for his interfaith activities and his lifelong commitment to \"building bridges between people and nations.\"\nRabbi Hyman represented the BSA in Saudi Arabia at Saudi Nation Day when they received an award for the work of the BSA with the Messengers of Peace Program. This program promotes service projects through social media in effort to achieve world peace.\nHyman recalls that trip as the most amazing experience of his life because he was welcome in a Muslim country.\nWhile the news of Rabbi Hyman's impending retirement is bittersweet, there is some good news.\nHe is not planning to leave the Eastern Shore.\nWhether he stays here for the short term or long term, one thing is certain. He has made countless selfless contributions to help make Easton, Talbot County, and our world a better place.\nEach one of them has earned Rabbi Hyman a well-deserved thank you and Godspeed.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant based in Easton. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She had grown up in Talbot County, but she had never known it was the famed abolitionist's birthplace.\n\"The historical society had put a notice in the paper asking for people to respond to a question \u2014 'Is anybody interested in honoring Frederick Douglass in some way since he's our native son.' And I read that and thought, 'I knew a lot about Frederick Douglass, but I did not know he was from Talbot County,'\" she said Saturday, surveying the crowd outside the Talbot County Free Library that had assembled for the annual Frederick Douglass Day celebration.\n\"... I was a little embarrassed by that but more interested in doing something because of that,\" Lowery said.\nLowery and her late husband became founding members of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society, the group that spearheaded the process of having a statue of Douglass erected on the Talbot County Court House lawn. The statue was unveiled to a crowd of thousands in June, 2011, after years of sometimes tense back-and-forth between the honor society, members of the community and local governments.\nFrederick Douglass Day evolved from that unveiling ceremony in an effort to continue the honor society's mission of educating the community about Douglass.\n\"Since 2011, the Frederick Douglass Honor Society decided that it wanted to continue efforts to continue the legacy of Frederick Douglass,\" said Walter Black, another founding member of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society. \"So the main thing that we concentrated on is the Frederick Douglass Day.\"\nOn Saturday, Frederick Douglass Day filled downtown Easton with a parade, a ceremony, a lecture, a children's village and a city block filled with vendors, nonprofits and live entertainment.\n\"The event gets bigger and better every year,\" said Debbi Dodson, the Frederick Douglass Day event coordinator. \"More people get involved and more people attend, so that is a sign that people appreciate it and really support it.\"\nThe keynote speaker for this year's event, Keidrick Roy, said that although this was his first time visiting Talbot County, he has been working with the Frederick Douglass Honor Society for several years.\nKeidrick Roy, a fellow at Harvard University, signed copies of his new book, \"American Dark Age: Racial Feudalism and the Rise of Black Liberalism,\" at the event. Roy said Douglass is heavily featured in the work.\n\"I've always wanted to be in the place where Frederick Douglass walked and talked and had many of his formative experiences, so it's very special for me to be here to do this,\" he said. \"I loved the celebration this morning, seeing so many people from different parts of the city, different parts of the town come out and honor Douglass in a variety of ways.\"\nIn holding the event every year, Lowery said the honor society hopes to ensure that all members of the community are aware of Douglass's ties to Talbot County and of how the principles of equality and freedom that Douglass espoused are still relevant today.\n\"What we wanted was for everybody to look at Douglass as an American hero and not an African American hero,\" Lowery said.\nOn Saturday, Lowery remarked that Talbot County had made progress toward that goal since 2011.\n\"We're always growing and getting better, or we should be anyway,\" she said. \"Every year, I know that there's progress.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Martinez said her story stems from an immigration story.\n\"I'm really proud of that because of (my parents') struggle, and their survival and their grit, I'm able to stand here in front of you today,\" she said.\nHer mother migrated from Mexico and her father from El Salvador. She grew up in Chicago, which she describes as \"a city that really appreciated and celebrated what it means to be Latina,\" though the city was heavily segregated.\nAfter meeting her husband and getting married, she moved to New York and became a teacher in the South Bronx, known as the poorest school district in the country. There, Martinez learned of excellence.\nShe said she was expected to perform at a level of excellence that she had never been asked to before, and in turn she learned to expect it from the people and students around her.\nShe said the South Bronx \"will forever be a part of my story and my legacy.\"\nAfter spending her time in the South Bronx, Martinez moved to Talbot County. It was a culture shock, but to her surprise, she found a growing Latino population. Her new home also forced her to affirm and challenge her own identity as a Latina.\nMartinez worked for Talbot County Public Schools and then founded Mid-Shore Scholars, a college prep program that serves first-generation college students.\nWhen leading the program, she decided it was time to focus on the marginalized student population. The program was meant to target a population of students who had the potential to go to Ivy Leagues, but she pushed for a different perspective. Martinez said it was important to focus on the students who lacked the resources to get to college.\n\"It's these students who don't have any help at home, who don't have any representation, whose parents want to give them the best life but didn't go to college here, who don't know the ropes or don't know how to navigate the system,\" Martinez said.\nDuring the pandemic, she decided to focus on building an institution to better assist marginalized communities and helped create the Polaris Village Academy. Martinez said the academy centers joy, celebrating culture and empowering students and families, making them feel safe and seen.\nMartinez ended her presentation with photos of her family visiting their native countries and the importance that focusing on her roots allowed her the opportunity to help those around her to grow.\n\"My superpower is that I am bicultural, that I have roots in (El Salvador) and in Mexico, and I have roots here, and that I can be both from there and from here, and then it's not 'and/or.' I could bring my whole self,\" Martinez said. \"And I encourage all the students here who are questioning their identity or wondering if they can be authentically themselves when they go to class or when they step into white institutions that yes, you can.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Along with the Delmarva Pride Center, the event was hosted by DoCo Pride and the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus.\nThe four-person panel \u2014 which included Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick), Fair's Chief of Staff Camila Reynolds-Dominguez, FreeState Justice Executive Director Phillip Westry and Maryland Office of the Attorney General Civil Rights Division Chief Jonathan Smith \u2014 answered questions related to schools and workplace, health care and family law.\nCaleb Holland, an attorney and the chair of DoCo Pride, who moderated the town hall, said the goal of the event is \"to prepare, not scare.\"\nOn the topic of education, Smith said he expects the Trump administration will try to push through executive orders around funding schools that are based on sports issues, bathrooms or the ability to deadname or misgender students. But Smith said there are \"very significant responses\" states can make.\n\"There's been a body of law that's developed that says the United States government cannot, through its funding powers, coerce states to take policy decisions that are not for the function of funding,\" he said.\nWestry said organizing and getting active in politics, like school boards, is a good way to get involved.\nAlthough part of Wednesday night's conversation focused on bracing for what could happen in the country, the panelists also talked about what gives them hope.\nFair, who is the chair of the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus, recalled the 2018 midterm elections. He said the country elected more women, more queer people and more people of color than ever before.\n\"In 2018, we figured out that in order to protect our rights, we need to do everything we can to put as many people who look like us into positions of power,\" he said. \"What I am hopeful for is that 2026 looks just like that.\"\nReynolds-Dominguez, who was previously a policy advocate and legal impact coordinator at FreeState Justice, said that in the last couple of years, the state has taken an \"aggressive stance\" on doing everything possible to anticipate rollbacks. She said Maryland is \"situated to weather this storm\" and that should be used as a catalyst for doing long-term work.\n\"The core of all of this is shifting people's hearts and minds,\" she said. \"And if we're not doing that work, we're spending our time in the wrong place.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If the person is approved after these steps, they will need to take the Oath of Allegiance at a naturalization ceremony.\nWaite said she believes the process costs about $800 to complete.\nAt the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, Waite and other volunteers help prepare those with green cards who want to obtain citizenship. She said volunteers help go over the Form N-400 application, review questions that could be on the test and practice reading and writing.\nWaite said the citizenship test includes an English portion and also asks questions about democracy, the constitution, history and geography.\nOffering some of the more difficult questions to the audience at the event, Waite said the people she works with come in for about 10 weeks to review questions and practice English.\n\"They learn a lot more than I think my nephew, who went to high school and college, could probably know,\" she said, causing people in the audience to laugh.\nClaudia White-Cooke and Joyce Dowling, who attended Waite's presentation, said after hearing some of the questions on the test, they weren't sure if they'd be able to pass it. White-Cooke said the process to become a citizen seems complicated and the people who apply are really committed.\nWhen one person at the event asked if the new presidential administration has affected the naturalization process at all, Waite \u2014 who said she is not an expert on what's happening at the national level \u2014 said she did notice a change in priority for legal entry into the U.S. from Venezuela.\n\"To a limit, a certain number of people from Venezuela were being given entry legally and now that's stopped,\" she said.\nWaite said she believes the naturalization process in the U.S. will continue, however. She said people still want to be American citizens.\n\"And I and others will do what we can to help,\" she said.\nThose who are interested in volunteering with the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center or want to learn more can call 877-772-9832 or visit chesmrc.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They were joined by Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller.\nMiller spoke at the unveiling, noting that Douglass' calls for justice still demand answers to date. She pointed out the crucial role he played in advancing education for Black Americans during a time when it was not widely accepted.\n\"Frederick Douglass dared to see beyond the chains that bound him,\" Miller said. \"He knew that true liberation was not just freedom of the body, but freedom of the mind.\"\nThe marker, one of nearly 800 official historical signs created by the Maryland Department of Transportation, will be placed at Tappers Corner Road and Route 303, just northeast of Cordova and near Douglass' birthplace.\nJulie Schablitsky, cultural resources chief for the Maryland Department of Transportation, said after working with Douglass family descendants and community members, an addition was made to the text on the historical marker: Anna Murray.\nMurray, Douglass' first wife, was \"strong\" and \"loyal,\" Schablitsky said. Many speakers Thursday maintained that Murray's fight for equality and justice was just as important as Douglass'.\nSchhablitsky noted Murray was crucial in Douglass' escape from slavery, sewing the sailor suit he used to disguise himself while fleeing north.\nKenneth Morris Jr., Douglass' great-great-great-grandson, called Murray an \"equal partner\" to her husband.\n\"It was Anna who made his escape possible,\" Morris said. \"Her strength, sacrifice and unwavering support ensured that his journey to freedom was not just his alone, but part of a greater fight for justice that continues today. I'm just as proud of her as I am of him.\"\n\"Her story reminded me that during difficult and challenging times, we must rely on each other and sometimes risk our own safety for the ones we love,\" Scablitsky said.\nOther local and state officials spoke during the event, including Department of Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld, Talbot County Council President Chuck Callahan and Easton Mayor Megan Cook.\nEdward \"Boots\" Robinson, president of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society, and Tarence Bailey, Douglass' five-time great nephew, provided words as well.\n\"No place is more important to mark his footsteps than where Frederick Douglass experienced his first taste of freedom while living with his grandparents, enjoying those few spiritful, joyful years,\" Robinson said.\nBailey said that when he was growing up in Easton, many of his elders didn't openly discuss the history of slavery in the area. Descendants of Harriet Tubman weren't allowed to talk about Tubman outside their houses, Bailey said.\nThe roadside marker will give the younger generations a chance to learn about that history and the local legacy of Douglass, Bailey said.\n\"We didn't have this,\" Bailey said. \"So to be able to give it to the next generation is really special.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the Associated Press, changes to the webpage included the removal of a photo of Tubman from the top of the page and text edits that removed references to slavery and changed descriptions.\nThe changes to the site came amid the efforts to remove diversity, equity and inclusion policies in the federal government.\nLast week, it was announced that changes to the webpage had been reversed.\nAccording to the Associated Press, a National Park Service spokesperson said the changes were made without approval. The spokesperson said the agency celebrates Tubman.\nIn her statement, Harris said she is \"saddened\" to know the current administration \"is making a concerted effort to rewrite and erase history.\"\nHarriet Tubman, an abolitionist and social activist who was born into and escaped from slavery in Dorchester County in the 19th century, became well known for her work on the Underground Railroad, a network of routes and safe houses that helped slaves escape to their freedom.

Major employers, federal agencies, universities and progressive communities launched diversity and inclusion initiatives.\nFive years after Floyd's death and ensuing protests and unrest, Joyner, a law professor at North Carolina Central University, is less optimistic.\n\"Now the opposite is occurring,\" Joyner said. \"There is a retrenchment.\"\nHe points to efforts by the Trump administration and other conservatives to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs and affirmative action hiring requirements, the directions of policies related to immigration and refugees and rollbacks of legal oversight sought by the Biden administration with the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments after the killings of Floyd and Breonna Taylor in 2020.\n\"The playbook seems to be pretty clear. There is an effort to undermine all the racial progress,\" Joyner said, contending DEI programs criticized by conservatives aim to be pathways to seeing the benefits of a pluralistic society.\n\"We see the parallels and the perils,\" Joyner said of the current landscape and America's history with race.\n'PROTECTING COMMUNiTIES' Since returning to power in January, President Donald Trump has shut down DEI programs (including in the U.S. military) and affirmative action hiring requirements for federal agencies and contractors.\nTrump argues for a \"merit-based society\" and conservatives say DEI and affirmative action policies disadvantage white people and continue to classify people along racial lines.\nThe U.S. Justice Department on May 21 said that it is dismissing federal lawsuits and proposed consent decrees with police in Minneapolis and Louisville in response to the Floyd and Taylor incidents.\n\"Overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.\nDhillon said the moves aim to end the Biden administration's \"failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments.\"\nA White House spokesperson said Trump is focused on safety and prosperity \"for all Americans\" and empowering law enforcement.\n\"President Trump is tirelessly enacting policies to ensure America's safety, prosperity, and success for all Americans. Through his Make America Safe Again agenda, the Trump Administration is committed to stopping crime, upholding justice, protecting communities, and empowering federal, state, and local law enforcement,\" said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields.\nThe White House said the president is not considering a pardon of Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer convicted of killing Floyd in May 2020.\nTrump has pressed the District of Columbia to remove Black Lives Matter street murals near the White House and wants to restore names of military bases that bore the names of Confederate generals.\nJoyner and Carpenter, an author and communications professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, feel undercurrents to Trump's rhetoric and agendas.\nThey see cultural and racial undertones to Trump's hard lines on immigration (including his efforts to end birthright citizenship), his nostalgia for a \"Golden Age\" of America and his administration's cuts to foreign aid and refugee programs for developing countries while launching a new one for white Afrikaner farmers from South Africa.\n\"Trump is perceived as turning back the clock,\" Carpenter said.\n'HUMAN NATURE'S SCRIPT'Carpenter sees societal swings after Floyd's death went viral on social media, highlighting police misconduct and America's complicated history of racial and social inequities.\n\"I do think there has been some progress,\" Carpenter said, noting some of the efforts related to policing.\nBut Carpenter said plenty of challenges remain citing research showing 75% of white people do not have friends of color and 66% of Black people don't have any white friends.\nCarpenter said African Americans still face obstacles and discrimination with jobs, noting a 2024 study that found job applicants with 'white-sounding' names were 50% more likely to get callbacks from employers than 'Black-sounding' names.\n\"It's an ongoing trauma. It's still a daily experience,\" Carpenter said of America's racial challenges.\nBut he also said the experiences of race in America and the current pushback to diversity and affirmative action programs have global and historical parallels.\n\"It's all throughout history where a majority population tends to favor themselves and dismiss the complaints of minorities,\" Carpenter said.\nHe said when minority rights are focused on, majority populations tend to feel they are being aggrieved.\n\"It's nothing new under the sun,\" Carpenter said. \"They are just following the human nature script.\"\nECHO CHAMBERSOthers on the frontlines of the social landscape see a mixed bag with the current state of race in America.\nErica Williams, executive director of A Red Circle, a St. Louis-based racial equity group, welcomed post-Floyd police changes such as body cameras and civilian review boards, but said the community distrust of law enforcement persists.\nShe said the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic \"deepened every pre-existing divide \u2014 especially in food access, education and health care.\"\nHer group has launched community food programs to help with post-pandemic inflation with U.S. prices up 25% since the pandemic.\n\"We grew more produce, hired youth interns, launched workshops and distributed thousands of pounds of fresh food to families,\" she said.\nAdant\u00e9 Pointer, a California-based civil rights attorney, sees ups and downs with policing since 2020.\n\"We are seeing officers prosecuted more frequently than before,\" he said. \"However, police shootings and killings have gone up.\"\nLast year, police killings of civilians totaled 1,365 persons, the highest on record, according to Mapping Police Violence.\nThere were 1,159 police-involved deaths in 2020.\nWhite people made up 42.7% of the 2024 deaths while accounting for 59% of the total population. Black people accounted for one-quarter of fatal police incidents while making up 13% of the population.\nPointer said the dominance of social media in contemporary discourse offers an opportunity to learn more about others and their paths. But it also mirrors societal biases and beliefs and technology algorithms allow users to stay in their ideological and social lanes.\n\"It becomes an echo chamber,\" he said.\nGOODBYE DEI?Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York, sees racial pendulums throughout American history.\nHe said there has been progress in narrowing racial income, education and employment gaps but worries about Trump \"appealing to white grievance.\"\nNeiman said. \"It also assumes that Black people have used racism as a weapon to win special privileges at the expense of whites .. It is dangerous: It diverts attention from the real racial disparities in our society and from developing policies to address them.\"\nThe U.S. poverty rate stands at 11% with 18% of African-Americans, 17% of Hispanic Americans, 19% of immigrants and 8% of white Americans living in poverty, according to U.S. Census data and FederalSafetyNet.com.\nSome of the companies and organizations that embraced DEI efforts after Floyd's death have jettisoned those efforts amid pushback from Trump and conservatives.\nOthers have faulted DEI programs as patronizing and self-serving.\n\"DEI is embraced by the business community when they think it will enhance their bottom lines,\" Pointer said. \"They are more than willing to walk away when it's not popular.\"\nSeveral large U.S. businesses, brands and technology firms have sought warm relations with Trump since he returned to power, attending and bankrolling his inauguration and attending other White House events.\nMuneer Panjwani, CEO of Engage for Good (which connects businesses and nonprofits) said DEI programs have driven \"meaningful progress.\"\n\"Companies have become significantly more aware of systemic racism and structural barriers faced by marginalized communities, taking actionable steps toward equity,\" he said.\nBut Panjwani acknowledges Trump has leveraged feelings of alienation among some white people. He also said equity conversations have sometimes been framed too narrowly, overlooking class, gender and other factors.\nCarpenter said white working-class Americans, who have seen stagnant wages and high inflation, have felt unheard in contemporary discourses.\nAll that comes amid post-pandemic financial strains and concentrations of wealth.\n\"Economic inequality has reached alarming levels, with the richest 1% holding over 31% of the nation's wealth while nearly half of Americans still struggle with unexpected financial burdens,\" Panjwani said.\nWilliams said her Missouri-based stays focused on its local work, including a community farm that grows its own food and is looking to offer its own grocery store and food production kitchen.\n\"We've seen an escalation of rhetoric and policymaking that undermines inclusive education, equity initiatives and even basic access programs. In that environment, I stay focused on building what my community needs,\" she said\nCarpenter agrees that it takes popular and grassroots changes in mindsets to move the needle.\n\"Politicians never lead,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "DEI is about giving everybody an opportunity\n\n June 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPHEN RIDEOUT | Section: Columns \n \n 600\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I am reading \"How We Learn to Be Brave\" by Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington.In her book, she writes about Thurgood Marshall and the challenges that he faced during his life.\n\"When he was denied admission to the University of Maryland School of Law on the basis of race, he reluctantly applied to Howard University School of Law, which he considered a far less reputable institution,\" she writes.\nThat interested me because I was aware that when he became a lawyer, he and the NAACP successfully sued the University of Maryland Law School in the case of Murray v. Pearson for denying Black students admission because of their race. It also interested me because of conversations I had with two men who had similar experiences.\nOne was a retired judge, who told me that he had gone to Howard and graduated as valedictorian. Thurgood Marshall asked him to apply to the University of Virginia Law School thinking that they would deny him admission, despite his qualifications, so that he could be Marshall's plaintiff in a lawsuit against the university.\nWhen he applied to UVA, he was not denied admission. Rather, he was approached by a wealthy benefactor of the university with the offer to pay for his law education at any other law school that would accept him. The retired judge accepted the offer, went to law school in New York, and had to tell Mr. Marshall that he would not be the plaintiff in that lawsuit.\nGregory Swanson became the successful plaintiff in that lawsuit against the rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia brought by the NAACP with Thurgood Marshall being one of the lawyers where Mr. Swanson was granted admission to the law school.\nSeveral years after my discussion with the retired judge, I had a chance meeting with Rep. Alcee Hastings from Florida. I sat near him on a plane trip and told him the story of the experience the retired judge had as a student. Interestingly, Congressman Hastings told me that it was not an isolated event, as the same thing had happened to him and had also happened to African Americans who had applied to medical schools in the South.\nSchools and alumni offered to pay their way to a graduate school in the north to avoid the litigation that might come from the denial of admission to the school to which they applied. While some may have been denied admittance, others were offered some benefit to go elsewhere such as the payment of their tuition at a law school or medical school elsewhere in the U.S.\nWhen I hear complaints about diversity, equity and inclusion, I never hear the full story of the background or reasoning for these complaints. I see the DEI effort not as promoting unqualified people to a position but rather giving all people the opportunity to be considered for a position who might otherwise be excluded from being considered. Giving everyone the opportunity to compete and learn from the experience, whether hired, admitted or not, seems to me to benefit everyone.\nColleges and universities have done something similar for many years for the children of alumni of their institutions where the child might not be considered the most qualified candidate but is admitted. How is that not favoritism based on connections rather than on skills and past accomplishments? In Cambridge during my time in city government, the search for qualified city employees included anyone interested and always tried to find people who were a good fit for our community who had the potential to become great and long-term workers for the city. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Still matters today': Community to read famous Frederick Douglass speech on Saturday\n\n July 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 499\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 On July 5, 1852, Frederick Douglass asked a burning question in front of hundreds of abolitionists in Rochester, New York: \"What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\"The Talbot County native, often considered the most important abolitionist and civil rights leader of his time, delivered an address that described why enslaved African Americans weren't afforded the same freedoms and liberties that could allow them to celebrate the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence like the rest of the nation.\nDouglass' famous speech is still popular 173 years later. On Saturday, the Easton-based Frederick Douglass Honor Society is hosting an annual community reading. Local officials, community leaders, residents and children are reading aloud portions of the address on the lawn of the Talbot County Courthouse starting at 10 a.m.\nVickie Wilson, the society's treasurer, says this year's calendar couldn't have worked out any better, with the event falling on the same day Douglass spoke to the Rochester Ladies Anti-Slavery Society.\n\"What's really exciting for us this year is that the first time Douglass read this speech was on July 5, 1852,\" Wilson said. \"And now, it falls again on July 5.\"\nThe Frederick Douglass Honor Society has held the reading annually since 2018, though it was put on pause last year for a separate event. Wilson says this year's return is exciting due to the diversity of people \u2014 in age, race, occupation and more \u2014 participating in the reading. Fifty-nine people are expected to step up to the podium.\n\"We live in a diverse community,\" Wilson said. \"It's going to show the love that we have for this community as well.\"\nDouglass in his 1852 speech explained the significantly different perspective enslaved people had on the Fourth of July holiday.\n\"What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim,\" Douglass said.\nHe continued: \"To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy \u2014 a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.\"\nWilson says the Talbot County tradition during the week of Independence Day is a moving one. She encourages people, no matter how they celebrate the holiday the rest of the week, to attend on Saturday.\nShe said the speech is a \"lot to unpack,\" but extremely powerful. It still resonates with her today, and she believes it does for many Talbot County residents.\n\"It still matters today,\" Wilson said. \"And I often think it matters more today in the climate that we're in right now. Everything here about this speech is still relevant.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This, even then, very narrow spit of land was entirely too small for the imprisoned population and must have collided with winter cold and intense summer sun.The recent efforts to alter our country's historical failings is, in my opinion, very dangerous. How many times have you heard parents say to their children, \"Remember, we learn from our mistakes.\"\nShould we not teach children about the Trial of Tears, where Native Americans were driven off their land and forced to relocate hundreds of miles from their homes?\nShould we not talk about the fear that drove the U.S. government to relocate Japanese men, women and children into interment camps? The officials who made the decision to move this population thought at the time that these individuals posed a real threat to the general population, particularly on the West Coast of the U.S.A.\nI grew up in the 1950s and 1960s. During my youth the country was trying to deal with Civil Rights issues. Every night on the news we saw demonstrations regarding this issue and heard Congress debate segregation versus integration. A decade later the Vietnam War was underway, and the country was split in many directions that were reflected in homes and on college campuses.\nLike many people my age I had to earn a living, and so I had to focus on the here and now as an employee. The daily tasks did not leave much time for debating politics with friends.\nI have seen in my lifetime people try to scapegoat the realities that both harmed and glorified our past.\nWe are an imperfect nation. Our forefathers created an engaging experiment. They created the greatest democracy ever witnessed on this planet.\nWe now have the opportunity to learn from our previous mistakes. I despise the fact that the Union Army starved and mistreated Southern soldiers, but that is a fact. I think it was a moral miscalculation to force Japanese families into prison campus, but that is a fact. The American Indian was relocated and forced to walk hundreds of miles from their land, but that's a fact. And old men and women can debate whether we should have ever placed ourselves in Vietnam, but we did, and that's a fact.\nThe role of the historian is to gather facts and tell us what took place and to provide the various options governments and individuals had when they made those decisions.\nHide the past, and it will only repeat itself.\nGILBERT MASTER\nPrince Frederick \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
