She was elected president of the board in December 2020 and held the role through 2022.Moving forward, Delean-Botkin said she hopes the Board of Education continues to maintain the county's high graduation rate and low dropout rate, expand its Career and Technical Education completer courses and implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a statewide plan to increase public education funding, improve student outcomes and improve the quality of public education.\"The other big thing that we're very proud of is having as many students as wish to go ahead and take the Advanced Placement classes and exams,\" Delean-Botkin said.At a July 19 Talbot County Board of Education meeting, President Emily Jackson said the board wishes Delean-Botkin the best of luck.\"We will miss her words of wisdom and her guidance,\" Jackson said.Talbot County Public Schools Executive Assistant Charlene Gould said in an email that the governor's office has been notified of the vacancy and will appoint a new board member to fill Delean-Botkin's seat until elections in November 2024.She said interested candidates can submit an application to the Governor's Appointments Office.In June, Commissioners Tom Costigan and Jimmy Jaramillo appointed Delean-Botkin to fill Commissioner Brian Wells' seat.Wells resigned at the June 27 Commissioners of Oxford meeting. He said he was resigning because he was moving to Easton.Before being appointed, Delean-Botkin ran against and lost to now Commissioner Katrina Greer. Greer took the seat of Jaramillo, who did not seek reelection.Delean-Botkin said her new role as Oxford commissioner is a \"challenging\" one.\"I think what we have to look at is, Oxford a town of about 600 folks,\" she said.\"Three sides are surrounded by water, so we have limits on growth. People tend to want to move to Oxford because of the quality of life.Majority of people that I talk to do not want to see many things change. They want to maintain the integrity of the town.\" \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY MAGGIE TROVATO\n \nSusan Delean-Botkin has resigned from the Talbot County Board of Education. \n \n Memo: \"The other big thing that we're very proud of is having as many students as wish to go ahead and take the Advanced Placement classes and exams.\" - Susan Delean-Botkin \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Kent 4-H alumna Jill Bramble to lead National Council\n\n August 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Trish Mcgee; For The Star Democrat | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1501\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Jill Bramble, who says the lessons she learned in 4-H while growing up in Kent County informed her leadership mode, has ascended to the very top of the organization.She has been named president and CEO of the National 4-H Council, the private sector, nonprofit partner of Cooperative Extension's 4-H program that focuses on fundraising, brand management, communications, and legal and fiduciary services.Her first day in the new role is Aug. 18.Bramble's appointment followed an 18-month, externally led search. According to a news release, the National 4-H Council board of trustees was unanimous in its support of Bramble.She has spent nearly 20 years as a member of the National 4-H Council team, beginning as a grant writer, and is currently the executive vice president and chief growth officer.\"I am humbled and honored to have this opportunity,\" Bramble said in a telephone interview July 23. \"4-H did so much for me as a young person. I feel so fortunate to be a product of this organization and I want to give back.\" Bramble said she stands on the shoulders of many Kent County mentors, family and friends. Among those she listed by name are John Hall, who was the University of Maryland Extension agent during her youth, Laura Bradley, and the Debnam, Crow, Dulin, Lott, Moffett and Hill families.Bramble traces her 4-H lineage to great-grandmother Susan Clarkson Fry who was a volunteer and supported the program in Montgomery County.Maternal grandparents Edwin C. \"Pop\" and Lorraine Fry, and their four young children, moved to Fair Hill Farms, near Chestertown, in 1960.The Fry family continues to own and operate the dairy and grain farm. The youngsters in the family, Matt and Megan Fry's sons Reid and Owen, are Intermediate age 4-H'ers in the Kent Clover Calf Club.In the 1980s, as a member of the Kennedyville Blue Banner 4-H Club, Bramble was involved in dairy, public speaking and photography projects and the ambassador program.\"I was a complete failure in all the sewing projects,\" she said in the phone interview, good-naturedly poking fun at herself.Pat Hill, who was the club leader then, said she was pleased and proud - but not surprised - to learn of Bramble's promotion.As a youth, Bramble embraced the 4-H motto \"To make the best better,\" according to Hill.\"I think she's still striving to that end,\" Hill wrote in an email Sunday. \"'Pop' Fry (Mr. Ed) would have been so proud.\" Hill pointed to Bramble as \"a role model for current 4-H members and all of Kent County youth.\" One of Hill's most treasured keepsakes is a counted cross-stitch 4-H emblem that Bramble made as a 4-H'er.Hill said she hangs that ornament on her Christmas tree every year.Another of Bramble's local supporters is Beth Hill, who has been the 4-H educator with University of Maryland Extension in Kent County for 28 years.\"It's amazing,\" Beth Hill said of Bramble's appointment.In an interview July 22, during the final night of the Kent County Fair, Beth Hill said: \"We're very proud that someone who had a passion for 4-H as a young person took that passion to the national level, helping kids across the country.\" She recalled that Bramble was invaluable in helping Kent County 4-H meet the endowment challenge of raising $10,000 in five years.\"Jill met with me in my office (in 2006) and told me, 'You can do this,'\" Beth Hill said.Through car washes and bake sales and other events, Kent 4-H'ers raised the $10,000 in three years.Bramble's grandparents, the Frys, made the first donation.Today, the endowment is at $86,000, according to Beth Hill.Nonprofit leadership was not the original plan for Bramble, who graduated from the University of Colorado in 1993 with a degree in kinesiology as a step toward a possible career as a physical therapist.Instead, she returned to Kent County about the same time that a family member was diagnosed with breast cancer.She started out as a volunteer with the American Cancer Society and ultimately landed a job as income development director tasked with corporate and special event fundraising for the mid-Atlantic division.Bramble said that's when the proverbial light bulb went off in her head that the more resources and donations you raise, the more you can impact a mission.She credited the six years she spent with the Cancer Society for sparking her interest in nonprofit leadership.Bramble went back to school and earned a master's degree in nonprofit management from the University of Maryland in 2001.From there she joined Just Cause Consultants in Chestertown, where she flourished under the mentorship of Linda Walls in grant writing as well as learning the ins and outs of board development and strategic planning for nonprofits and funders.As Bramble and her husband Scott started their family - son Nick and daughter Jordan are now college graduates - she said she began to give serious thought about \"how kids grow and what is on their minds.\" In a stroke of good fortune, what Bramble described as \"serendipity,\" the National 4-H Council was advertising for a grant writer.She remembered thinking that after having had the opportunity as a youngster to grow through 4-H, she needed to \"pay it forward,\" and her excitement about leading nonprofits made this an ideal opportunity for her.Hired in May 2005, she has spent the past 18 years and three months with the National 4-H Council.As a senior vice president and chief development officer, Bramble led the national resource development team that advances strategic individual, corporate and foundation partnerships in support of the 4-H mission.In March 2022, she was elevated to executive vice president and chief growth officer.Bramble said part of what drives her is the ideal that all youth have access to the opportunities that 4-H offers, which include growing life skills like confidence, independence, resilience and compassion.4-H is America's largest youth development organization, with six million boys and girls ages 5 to 19 and 600,000 volunteers nationwide.The origin of 4-H dates to the turn of the 20th century, and was first called a Corn Club because agriculture was then the leading industry.While ag is still very much a part pf 4-H, the organization is expanding to include robotics, coding, engineering and even artificial intelligence.Bramble said 4-H is a microcosm of America, and what people see locally differs in each community.For example, in the inner city of Dallas, Texas, the program is focused on technology and AI.\"I don't want to take away from how critical agriculture is - it provides food, clothing and housing - but 4-H is more than that,\" Bramble said. \"It is to encourage kids to take on leadership roles and engage them in their communities.\" Bramble said she has witnessed firsthand the transformative power of 4-H programs.\"As the leader of the National 4-H Council, I will spend every single day ensuring all kids have access to the powerful, life-changing outcomes that I experienced in my own childhood,\" she said in a news release.\"I have endless faith in the leadership of the next generation if we give them the tools they need to be successful,\" she said, adding that her role \"will be to empower Cooperative Extension 4-H educators to help America's youth reach their full potential.\" In announcing Bramble's appointment, the National 4-H Council noted her 18 years of successful leadership experience at the organization and a deep commitment to its mission, values and goals.Throughout her time with the National 4-H Council, Bramble \"has consistently demonstrated her dedication to empowering young people, fostering innovation, and strengthening partnerships,\" the organization stated in a news release. \"Her strategic insights, collaborative approach, and passion for positive youth development make her the ideal candidate to lead the National 4-H Council into its next phase of growth and impact.\" Bramble succeeds Jennifer Sirangelo, who is leaving after 10 years as president and CEO to lead Points of Light.\"While it's hard to step away from 4-H,\" Sirangelo said in a news release, \"this transition is easier knowing that Jill will be National 4-H Council's next leader. Jill is the best person for this role. I have the utmost confidence in her and know the future is bright with her at the helm.\" Bramble will be able to continue to work remotely from her home in Bluffton, South Carolina, while spending one week a month at headquarters in Washington.She extended an open invitation to Kent County residents, current 4-H'ers and 4-H alumni to visit whenever she is in D.C.Kent County will always be \"home,\" said Bramble, who has family and friends still living here.She said she hopes that in her new position she can continue to give back to Kent County. \n \n Caption: JILL BRAMBLE\n \nCONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nWhile growing up in Kent County, Jill Bramble was a member of the Kennedyville Blue Banner 4-H Club, where she was involved in dairy, public speaking and photography projects and the ambassador program.\n \nCONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nA teenaged Jill Bramble is pictured with Peppermint Patty, her first 4-H project, given to her by her grandfather Edwin C. \"Pop\" Fry when she was 8 years old and the cow was just a calf. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Library will host a ribbon-cutting and dedication ceremony at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 8, welcoming all community members to come out and experience the expanded facilities.This expansion effort has been a joint effort of the State of Maryland, the Maryland State Library Agency, Queen Anne's County Commissioners, and citizens and Library friends advocating for the needed addition of spaces in the Branch. This expansion culminated in the creation of innovative community meeting rooms, a welcoming lobby area, and a state-of-the-art Makerspace designed to inspire creativity and facilitate learning.\"These additions to our Library mark an important step forward in our commitment to serve our community,\" said Janet Salazar, Queen Anne's County Library director. \"Our expanded spaces aim to foster deeper connections, broaden intellectual horizons, and facilitate the sharing of ideas in an increasingly interconnected world.\" The community meeting rooms are equipped with modern audio-visual technology to enable high-quality presentations, discussions, workshops, and other events. The inviting lobby will act as a hub of social interaction, encouraging community members to connect, collaborate and engage.Perhaps the most exciting feature of this expansion is the Makerspace, an interactive area equipped with a range of tools and equipment, such as 3D printers, laser engravers, vinyl printers and cutters, sewing machines, and crafting materials, designed to inspire innovation and creativity. The Makerspace is set to become a platform for local inventors, entrepreneurs, students and hobbyists to bring their ideas to life.The ribbon-cutting ceremony on Aug. 8 will officially open these spaces to the public. Following the event, library staff will be on hand to give tours of the new facilities and demonstrate the features of the Makerspace.The Kent Island Branch of Queen Anne's County Library is grateful for the community's support and participation in the creation of these spaces and warmly welcomes everyone to join us celebrating this important milestone. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nQueen Anne's County Library invites community to celebrate the dedication of the renovated Kent Island Branch with ribbon-cutting ceremony on Aug. 8. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was later the academic and career adviser guiding students through actionable plans to achieve their goals.A native of Costa Rica, Solano came to the United States as a graduate student.After earning her bachelor's degree in Costa Rica, she worked for an international flower exporter as she continued her studies toward licensure at the University of Costa Rica.Her future plans took a turn when a professor at the university asked if she was adventurous.Thinking that the professor meant bungee jumping or some other daredevil sport, Solano prepared to decline. Instead, the professor asked if she would be interested in taking on a new academic challenge in a different country. He recommended her for a graduate research post at the University of Maryland.While working on \"green\" roof research and earning her master's degree in natural resources science at College Park, Solano's interest grew in building sustainable communities through policy and education.She went on to earn a Ph.D.in public policy and urban affairs at the University of Delaware.\"It's ironic that I studied urban affairs and ended up in a rural area,\" Solano said. \"Rural and urban areas face many of the same challenges, though, and people in both areas want the same things.\" Better lives and a greater sense of community, Solano said, are common desires for most people.The Cambridge Center provides both, she added. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED.\n \nLorelly Solano is the new director of the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The event drew about 2,100 participants.The annual event, organized and run by volunteers, has grown into one of the state's largest ride and has helped to raise more than $2 million with 15,000 participates since the ride's inception in 2001. Now, much more than a ride, Chrome City is a way for the community to learn more about Benedictine's mission to help children and adults with developmental disabilities achieve their greatest potential.The school serves students from the entire Mid-Atlantic region, including Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Virginia.Each year students dance along with Rockin' Elvis and riders and participants vie for the Sister's Choice award. This year an orange HD Turbo Road King was the grand prize winning bike, and Ray Nails with a red and silver 1954 Pontiac Star Chief was the grand prize car winner. New this year was the Kid's Choice awards given to Donald Teat in a national grand champion Huckster and Mike Ledbetter in his Harley Davidson motorcycle.For the first time in the event's history, Benedictine auctioned off a donated-signed Paul Reed Smith electric guitar with all proceeds going to benefit the organization.\"We are honored to have so many car enthusiasts from all over the state come to support the kids each year,\" said Spud Blake, Chrome City Ride volunteer chair. \"This is an event where our kids love seeing the cars and motorcycles. They interact with the various owners.The owners take a lot of great individual time to show the kids what is special about their cars and motorcycles.\" Generous sponsors, community partners, and volunteers continue to make the event a success year after year. Blake thanked CPR Vintage Porsche Restoration in Easton for helping to promote the event and serving as a registration location as well as Outback Steakhouse in Annapolis, Rommel Harley-Davidson Delmarva of Salisbury, Old Glory Harley-Davidson dealership, and Hitchcock Autoworks for serving as registration locations and rally points.Volunteers from Callahan's Gas and Appliance in Centreville helped with parking the hundreds of cars on campus, along with volunteers from Choptank Transport in Preston.Each rider passed under a large American flag at Benedictine's front entrance waving from a ladder truck. Famous Dave's provided a hot barbecue lunch, and each rider took home a collectible T-shirt printed and designed by Benedictine's Graphics department.Notable attendees in years past include Candy Clark, Cindy Williams and Bo Hopkins from the George Lucas 1973 classic American Graffiti, as well as area legislators. The event has attracted celebrity donors as well. For more than five years car enthusiast and talk show host Jay Leno donated to the event, as well as a collector from New Jersey who donated a 1941 Willys Pro Street Coupe in 2016. This year's 2019 event bought the largest crowd of riders and spectators to date.At the beginning of 2018, the Benedictine School earned a two-year accreditation through 2020 from the National Commission for the Accreditation of Special Education Services.The accreditation placed the Benedictine School among 26 institutions in the nation to receive the honor out of about 200 special education schools.As a national commission that verifies and promotes excellence in education service, NCASES evaluates private special education programs through a process that encourages diversity of educational practice and innovation. The process assures students in private special education settings are provided environments that are healthy, safe, comfortable and conducive to learning.NCASES also named Benedictine School teacher Lorraine Slama the 2018 Educator of the Year.For more information about the Benedictine School, visit www.benschool.org.@Kayla StarDem \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO/\n \nMotorcycles thundered down the mile-long lane onto the Benedictine School campus during the 18th annual Chrome City Ride in Ridgely Sunday, July 28.\n \nPHOTO BY KAY LA RIVAS/\n \nMore than 2,100 classic cars, street rods and motorcycles from six rally points across Maryland and Delaware thundered onto the Benedictine campus on Sunday, July 28, for Chrome City Ride.

As she enters her senior year with a typical mix of excitement and nervousness, she is looking after graduation at studying animal science with a minor in equine science.Macrina Zbobysz, 14, of Preston, won the fair princess pageant, and she did archery as her talent for the competition, sending three arrows downrange to a target 20 meters away with impressive accuracy and poise.Macrina, a homeschooler, has participated in 4-H for seven years, and enjoys participating in the archery club, a pursuit she said taught her persistence and focus on a goal.The newly crowned princess's mom, Jill Zbobysz, said her family got involved in 4-H for the community atmosphere and the education it offers kids.\"It cultivates them as an individual,\" Jill said. \"Good kids, good families, it's just wonderful.Macrina said she is preparing for her first participation in the upcoming statewide archery competition, an event that places the targets at 60 meters. Her initial goal for the first year in the senior division is to place in the top ten.Lily Hutchison took home the first place ribbon in the working weather goat show on Aug. 3, with her Oberhasli goat Honey Dude towing the four she made with her dad, Danny.Lily, an 8-year-old rising third grader from Ridgely, just finished her first year in 4-H.\"She's learned responsibility, she's learned how to take care of an animal. She's learned that if she gives love and attention to that animal, she will in turn get love and attention from that animal,\" said Lily's mom, Jana Hutchison.Lily has a horse and two goats in addition to Honey Dude. \"She love her goats,\" Jana said with a laugh.Outgoing fair Queen Rebecca Brault said she enjoyed her yearlong reign, particularly the chance to do interviews and public relations work about 4-H and what it has meant to her.\"4-H for me is such a growth opportunity,\" Brault said, explaining that when she started she hated public speaking and being in front of people. In addition to helping her enjoy those things, she has learned other practical skills like sewing and photography.Brault, who was homeschooled and is preparing to further her education, said the fair embodies and gives a platform to the good things that 4-H offers.Rebecca's mom, Christina Brault, said her daughter always enjoyed promoting 4-H, so the time spent as the fair queen was a role that came naturally.\"It's definitely given her a lot more poise, she's more well-spoken than a lot of kids her age and she's got a wide variety of interests that I thank 4-H for,\" Christina said.In a societal climate of busy lifestyles, Christina encouraged parents to invest the time in getting their kids involved: \"You will get as much out of it as your child does.\" \"I believe that for the youth it's a bonding experience.They're here, they cheer each other on, there's not a cliquey feeling. There's just a lot of education, and it's done in a fun way,\" she said. \n \n Caption: DUSTIN HOLT/FOR TIMES-RECORD\n \nThe Caroline/Dorchester County Fair crowned its royal court on opening night Wednesday, Aug. 2.

    "content": "School district saves thousands in energy costs - Program focuses on use and use reduction\n\n August 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 17 | Section: News \n \n 581\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - Efforts by Caroline County Public Schools to reduce energy costs have resulted in almost $260,000 in savings as a result of a yearlong program managed by Cenergistic, an energy conservation company based in Dallas, Texas.Reporting at the Aug. 1 meeting of the Caroline County Board of Education, Cenergistic Client Manager Scott Muir shared a slide show depicting how the program has saved the school district money since July 1, 2022.School board president Richard Barton called the first annual report \"really exciting stuff.\" \"I've just got to give you guys big kudos,\" Muir said. \"This is one of the fastest and most successful starts to a program that I've seen.\" Muir and Superintendent Dr.Derek Simmons credited Cenergistic Energy specialist Josh Rein for his work in the district.\"Having Josh here from the very beginning\" was beneficial, Muir said. \"Typically we do have a challenge hiring an energy specialist from outside the district, so they have to develop all these relationships and try and do it quickly. And we just got off to a great start with him already knowing everyone here.\" Cenergistic created the energy conservation program that \"assists in minimizing the impact that cost increases has on the budget,\" according to the report. Four energy sources were considered: electricity, solar, heating oil and propane.The lion's share of cost increases was from electricity the school district buys from the grid at a 64% increase and heating oil with a 42% increase.\"There's not a whole lot we can do about the costs, so our company focuses on use and use reduction,\" Muir said.Relying on solar and setting back thermostats on weekends, nights and during the summer made a difference, Muir said.From July 2022 through June 2023, 80% of CCPS's utility spending was on electricity.\"That's a huge area of focus for Josh and our team,\" Muir said.However, even with the increases in energy costs, the public schools decreased energy use intensity (EUI) by 35%. Energy use intensity is a measure of 1,000 BTUs of energy per square foot, \"a benchmark that the EPA uses,\" Muir said. It's also used for Energy Star certification.\"It's a way of measuring elementary schools against other elementary schools, houses against houses, and the regional average here for K12 schools is 54 EUI,\" Muir said. \"When we started the program, you actually were doing pretty well; you were already at 50 EDI. And today, for the last 12 months, we're down to 32 EUI. So at that at that level, our company is going to be looking at getting certified for Energy Star for a lot of facilities.\" An \"energy savings day\" on Monday July 3, \"was a great little initiative and the results show,\" Muir said.Rein performed more than 1,516 building audits, \"and that equates to 1,451 metric tons of CO2 emissions avoided,\" Muir said. \"That's a huge environmental footprint.\" Muir compared the 1,451 metric tons of CO2, equating them to \"over 3.5 million miles driven by an average car,\" he said. \"That amount of energy can power 175 homes for the year.\" Cenergistic has a five-year contract with the Caroline County Public Schools.\"The message to the taxpayer is (our) more efficient use of money, and that's something you don't hear government say very often,\" Barton said.To view the full report, visit https://go.boarddocs.com/mabe/carps/Board.nsf/Public, open the Aug. 1 agenda and click on the \"Cenergistic Update\" link. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/TIMES RECORD\n \nCenergistic Client Manager Scott Muir shared a slide show depicting how the program has saved the school district over $250,000 since July 1, 2022 \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In the coming months, Cambridge residents are likely to meet Solano as she begins her community outreach efforts.The Cambridge Center, Solano said, is a resource for everyone in Dorchester County, playing a critical role in the economic and social health of the downtown area.In addition to credit classes in both transfer and career programs, the center also offers workforce training, personal enrichment opportunities and meeting spaces for community organizations. The center also houses the American Job Center.\"We're an education center for students of all ages, but I hope residents here also see us as a center of community growth,\" Solano said.Solano first joined Chesapeake as an English as a Second Language instructor.She was later the academic and career advisor guiding students through actionable plans to achieve their goals.A native of Costa Rica, Solano came to the United States as a graduate student.After earning her bachelor's degree in Costa Rica, she worked for an international flower exporter as she continued her studies toward licensure at the University of Costa Rica.Her future plans took a turn when a professor at UCR asked if she was adventurous.Thinking that the professor meant bungee jumping or some other daredevil sport, Solano prepared to decline. Instead, the professor asked if she would be interested in taking on a new academic challenge in a different country.He recommended her for a graduate research post at the University of Maryland.While working on \"green\" roof research and earning her master's degree in natural resources science at College Park, Solano's interest grew in building sustainable communities through policy and education.She went on to earn a Ph.D. in public policy and urban affairs at the University of Delaware.\"It's ironic that I studied urban affairs and ended up in rural area,\" Solano said. \"Rural and urban areas face many of the same challenges, though, and people in both areas want the same things.\" Better lives and a greater sense of community, Solano said, are common desires for most people. The Cambridge Center provides both, she added.For more information about the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center, please visit www.chesapeake.edu/cambridge. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nDr. Lorelly Solano is the new director of the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mid-Shore Pro Bono interns gain valuable experience\n\n August 17, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Detmer; mdetmer@chespub.com | Page: A2 | Section: News \n \n 1673\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - As the summer academic break enters its final phase, three Maryland students working as interns at Mid-Shore Pro Bono this summer reflected on their experiences thus far.Clay Benedict of Baltimore, James Parkinson of Oxford, and Gabrielle Shlikas were selected as the nonprofit's summer 2023 interns.Benedict is a legal intern through the University of Baltimore School of Law's EXPLOR program.The program ensures that all law students obtain a legal internship during the summer after their first year, with participating employers accepting one law student or more selected by the program.Parkinson is an intern and Shlikas is a legal intern through MSPB's Sandy Brown Public Interest internship program.The paid internship program was established to honor MSPB's previous executive director Sandy Brown and is supported by individual donors and the Campbell Foundation.The donor-funded program provides undergraduate and law school students with a stipend while learning in the areas of public interest law, nonprofit management, community service and basic work experience.CLAY BENEDICTClay Benedict is a 2025 Juris Doctor candidate at the University of Baltimore School of Law.Born in Baton Rouge, he holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science from Louisiana State University, where he served as Secretary for the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity.Benedict served in the U.S. Army Infantry out of Fort Polk, Louisiana, working as a Battalion Property Manager and directly with the Commander.\"Working as an MSPB legal intern has been a humbling experience that has allowed me to interact with real people facing prevalent yet overlooked legal issues,\" Benedict said. \"Statistics, articles and just basic common knowledge about the disparity in legal aid and legal knowledge between those with resources and those without, is one thing; but here, I get to see those statistics unfold before my eyes, both inside and outside the courtroom.\" \"I decided to intern at MSPB because I was offered the opportunity to observe and learn firsthand the inner working procedures and processes, consequences, and defenses involved in a vast array of legal issues that affect everyday people,\" Benedict said. \"Whether it be representing tenants in rent court, helping draft wills, helping people overcome their debt, or helping people with internal family matters, there was something here for me to learn.\" Over the course of the summer, he has observed meetings between the attorneys and their clients in the realms of rent court hearings, estate planning and other family matters.Benedict also works part time at a personal injury firm, where he drafts complaints, interrogatories and case summaries, and where he conducts legal research for specific questions or trial related issues.Benedict said his work in the elder law clinic really stands out to him.\"Not only was it interesting and nice to get to meet so many people and hear their stories, but it was also very productive in terms of being able to assess someone's problem and then put it on a path of satisfactory resolution in the span of one simple meeting,\" he said.\"So many people, when dealing with planning for their death or with the death or incapacitation of a family member, have no idea what is going on or what they need to do, so it's really fulfilling helping them work through these critical moments of their lives.\" With his sights set on graduating and passing the bar, Benedict has a flexible view of what legal field he might work in. \"I am not too concerned with respect to what kind of law I would like to practice, so long as I am able to conduct research, write, and argue in a stable, longterm setting,\" he said.JAMES PARKINSONJames Parkinson grew up in Easton and graduated from Easton High School in 2020. He is pursuing his Bachelor of Arts in Government and Politics with a minor in History from the University of Maryland, College Park, where his academic honors have earned him membership in the Pi Sigma Alpha National Political Science Honor Society.His academics earned him a Fall 2022 University Honors College Citation and acceptance into the Government and Politics Honors Program.Parkinson currently is serving as a Maryland General Assembly Intern and Legislative Assistant with Delegate Steven J. Arentz, and previously served as a District Office Intern and Legislative Assistant with Delegate Johnny Mautz. He is the captain and goalkeeper of the University of Maryland Club Soccer Team's red squad.\"Interning with Mid-Shore Pro Bono this summer has allowed me to work alongside dedicated legal professionals and attorneys, whose common goal of serving the Eastern Shore community has been a source of constant inspiration,\" Parkinson said. \"Through learning about our client intake process and helping with in-person clinics, I have gained a better understanding of the intricacies of legal work outside the courtroom. I have also been able to attend court proceedings with a dynamic team focused on housing justice on the Lower Shore.\" This summer, Parkinson has learned about three areas of law: elder, family and housing. He has found some of his duties, like doing intakes for new clients, are not specific to one area of law, but a bulk of his work corresponds to one of these three areas.Parkinson has helped in scheduling clients for our elder law clinics, and assisted MSPB volunteer attorneys as they draft wills and other legal documents, like power of attorney forms or advance medical directives. In the area of housing law, he has gone to court with the MSPB staff attorney and paralegal from the Salisbury office, helping tenants in rent court with a variety of legal issues. His experience in family law matters has mostly been doing intakes, connecting people to our network of volunteer attorneys.\"My experience in housing court has been the highlight of my summer experience. Prior to this internship, I had never seen the inside of a courtroom, and I now feel comfortable in the Dorchester and Wicomico District courthouses. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with our housing team as they represent clients in landlord versus tenant cases - they are dedicated to working towards greater housing justice on the Eastern Shore.\" Parkinson plans to attend law school after graduation.GABRIELLE SHLIKASGabrielle Shlikas is a 2025 J.D. candidate and a Christine A. Edwards Dean's Scholar at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. Her time at the Carey School of Law includes serving as a student member of the Administrative Committee, as an event moderator with the Business Association, as a student representative of the Admissions Office, and as a member of the Women's Bar Association.Shlikas graduated cum laude from Wellesley College with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and English, where she was a Tanner Conference speaker and graduated from the She Should Run Program. She is an Alumnae Member of The Wellesley Fund, having served as a Philanthropy Team Supervisor, Candidacy Exploration Researcher, and Residential Assistant.Shlikas received a diploma from the International Baccalaureate Program and additionally has served as a Senate Page with the Maryland General Assembly and as an Executive Board Member of the Maryland Youth Advisory Council.\"Working at MSPB has been an amazing experience - I've learned so much not only about the law itself but how to conduct myself as a legal professional,\" Shlikas said.\"With MSPB, I've had the privilege of helping those in my community through a variety of problems, questions, and situations.I wanted to be an MSPB Intern because I wanted to do work that directly impacted the area I call home, and doing so this summer has been extremely rewarding.\" After graduation, Shlikas anticipates working in business law, with an eventual goal of practicing family and divorce law.Shlikas described her work this summer as \"absolutely fantastic.\" \"There's been a lot of opportunity for me to get practical experience and see lawyers doing work.Some of the most informative experiences have been her weekly work in rent court, the legal venue for disputes between landlords and tenants, primarily regarding potential evictions. \"It's been amazing to see the amount of people who don't know that they have rights in the situation, or don't realize that there are a lot of ways their issue can be resolved without them being evicted.\" Shlikas has also worked with the expungement clinic, a service more in demand due to recent changes in state law about cannabis-related convictions.One impactful experience of the summer for Shlikas was helping a man get expungements on multiple convictions ranging back decades. The man told Shlikas the convictions had kept him from applying from certain types of jobs, and that he was excited about his expanded employment opportunities.Additionally, Shlikas found it rewarding to help tenants expecting to be evicted because they were with oldling their rent because of concerns with the liveability of the property they rented to find a resolution through the legal process that included those necessary improvements being made.\"It's been great to be exposed to all of these areas of law,\" Shlikas said.MID-SHORE PRO BONO INTERN OPPORTUNITIES\"We're honored to have Clay, James, and Gabrielle continuing their educations with us,\" said Mid-Shore Pro Bono Executive Director Meredith Lathbury Girard. \"We're also grateful for the University of Baltimore School of Law's EXPLOR program and especially for the donors to our Sandy Brown Public Interest Internship fund that help underwrite stipends for our interns.\" Girard said the nonprofit is uniquely positioned to expose students who are interested in the practice of law, social work and public interest work through hands-on experiences working with rural populations lacking the same resources as urban areas.\"This program engages students in a wide range of legal-related experiences in a high quality and well-supervised professional setting,\" she said. \"And undergraduate students interested in law, justice, and criminal justice as well as other civic-minded careers will be exposed to hands-on experience in these areas as well.\" Mid-Shore Pro Bono connects Eastern Shore individuals and families in need of legal representation with volunteer attorneys to ensure that all can have access to the assistance needed, with offices in Easton and Salisbury.

There were also 25 vendors in the shade near the pavilion giving out all kinds of free items like sunglasses and bucket hats and, more importantly, information about the services they offer. This diverse community networking event was put on by For All Seasons.It was a family-centric back-to-school crowd. While the rock trio Brookletts played Jimi Hendrix and Santana and Bossa Nova, children played with hulahoops and got free Rita's Italian Ice in three flavors: mango, cherry and blue raspberry.Their tongues revealed their flavor preferences.John Qvarnstrom, marketing and communications associate at For All Seasons, said, \"What is great about today is we have been able to successfully bring together 25 different organizations in our community and give away over 800 backpacks to families - all in the space of one hour.Every year we have been growing and this only shows that our community wants this here. And we are going to keep rising to meet their demand.\" He also had some positive metrics of this event's second year to share.\"We had 400 blue bags, which is one per family so they can put all their supplies in.We ordered enough popcorn for 800 people.Going back to school is something a community does; it is not one family; it is not one business; it is not even one school.It is all of us together. People and families these days are hurting. They need these supplies. We make it so every kid, regardless of socio economic status, can start the school year on their best foot,\" Qvarnstrom said.He added they had about 20 volunteers, all wearing blue shirts. Volunteers were translating, scooping Italian ice, handing out popcorn and even handing out bottles of icy water.Katie Theeke, vice president of marketing and communications at For All Seasons, said that all her volunteers showed up on time and did an amazing job putting everything together.\"Everyone is relaxed and enjoying each other's company. This is really an event about community. We gave over 665 backpacks away. People show up if you find the right way to share the message out in the community.It feels great to see this many people together and getting what they need,\" Theeke said.The event was a melting pot for the community.\"It is great to see people from all different communities across the Shore show up together. It is a very diverse population tonight, and everybody is having a blast,\" Theeke said.The amount of information and services made available was staggering.They had mental health services, groups addressing food insecurity, Boy Scouts, translation help for Hispanics and more. High Point Church was there sharing its community. Easton Mayor Megan Cooke was there with her team from Care Packs, which feeds food insecure students in the public school system. The Talbot County Public Library had a booth, and volunteers guessed they had enlisted 100 new free members.Janine Puma Martinez, translator for For All Seasons, would like to see the event, which already grew by 50% from last year, get even bigger.\"This shouldn't be the only outreach event. More of our outreach agencies should collaborate together.There is always somebody out there that needs that helping hand or that needs a smile to get them out of that way of thinking like those thoughts of ending their precious lives,\" Martinez said.This colorful event was full of smiles and neighbors saying hello to each other - in addition to backpacks, pencils and library cards. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY TOM MCCALL/TMCCALL@CHESPUB.COM\n \nFrom left, Royalti Hall, 2, Taliah Baker, 10, and Ah'mir Dodd, 10, get free backpacks and hats.

    "content": "Birds, the Brain and Plato kick off Chesapeake Forum's fall schedule\n\n August 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A10 | Section: News \n \n 600\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Chesapeake Forum launches its fall term Sept. 6 with Plato's Republic, a trip to Poplar Island and a one-session course on how to lower your risk of Alzheimer's through diet and lifestyle choices.One of Chesapeake Forum's most popular instructors, Forest Hansen, Ph.D., returns with a four-session course on \"Plato's Republic,\" starting Wednesday, Sept. 6. Considered by many to be a cornerstone of Plato's work, the dialogue explores two central questions: First, what is justice, and secondly, is the just person happier than the unjust person? or what is the relation of justice to happiness?Participants will explore these questions through guided discussions and selected readings. After Hansen's class on Meno last term, one student remarked, \"I learned as much from the participants and Forest, as Plato and Socrates!\" Hansen earned a BA in English at Harvard, an MA in English at the University of Wisconsin, and a Ph.D. in Philosophy at Johns Hopkins.For more than 35 years he taught a variety of courses in English and philosophy, as well as courses in Greek Civilization, Classics in Western Thought, and more.Plato's Republic is four-sessions, Wednesdays, Sept. 6, 13, 20 and 27, from 10 to 11:30 a.m. Cost: $40.Zoom only.If philosophy doesn't ring your bell, may birding will. In \"Restoration Earns Its Wings: Birds of Poplar Island,\" Kristina Motley and Tim Carney with the Maryland Environmental Service, along with our favorite CF birder Wayne Bell, lead a hybrid classroom/field trip to the barrier island to check up on its burgeoning bird population. We'll start with a classroom session with Motley and Carney, followed a week later with a birding field trip over to the island where Bell will join us as well.So far, more than 400 acres of wetlands have been restored on Poplar Island.This restoration supports over 250 different species of birds that have been documented on or just offshore and over 40 different bird species that have been confirmed as nesting onsite.Motley, is a Senior Environmental Specialist with the Maryland Environmental Service, where she has worked on the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island for the past five years.\"Restoration Earns Its Wings: Birds of Poplar Island\" is two sessions, Wednesday, Sept. 6, from 10-11:30 a.m. Hybrid (Zoom, in person at the Easton Family YMCA or recording).

    "content": "Governor visits Benedictine\n\n August 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom Mccall; tmccall@chespub.com | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 857\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY - Gov. Wes Moore visited the Benedictine campus on Aug. 17. Although a phalanx of elected officials showed up, he seemed most enthused with the students he met. He even high-fived a couple and returned a \"peace out\" hand gesture in kind.He was joined by Maryland Department of Disabilities Secretary Carol Beatty.The campus was the governor's first stop through the Eastern Shore as he attended the annual Maryland Association of Counties summer conference.\"It was my privilege to visit Benedictine Programs and Services and witness firsthand the amazing work being done by the staff that is crucial to the success of our students,\" Moore said. \"The caring leadership of Director Scott Evans and Educational Director Julie Hickey aligns with our administration's mission to leave no one behind. I thank them for their admirable work toward this vital goal.\" Beatty believes strongly in the Benedictine mission.\"This is a critical organization for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in our state,\" Beatty said. \"A lot of the school systems look to a school like this for assistance and support for their students.They also have a very vibrant adult service program.So they are training people to work.\" Benedictine Programs and Services offers a year-round educational residential program for students throughout Maryland, ages 5-21, as well as adjoining states, and an expansion is set for the facility with the support of a $1.5 million capital grant in fiscal year 2023 budget.The funding will be used for the construction and engineering costs associated with building a new student residential building. The fiscal year 2024 capital budget included an additional $2.5 million for the campus project.\"It was an honor to host Gov. Moore at our campus in Ridgely. We had the opportunity to tour our facility, where the governor met students, teachers and our supported adults,\" Evans said.\"We thank the governor and his staff for taking the time to learn about what we do here at Benedictine in fulfilling our mission to help the individuals we support achieve their greatest potential and highest level of independence,\" he added.They took Moore into a classroom where two students were learning about pirates. The super-engaged teacher of functional academics was Leslie Nelson.The governor jumped right into the lesson and gave high fives for correct answers.One unscripted moment happened in a hallway when Moore approached two parents who had just left their son Jake off at Benedictine for his first time. Peggy was in tears, partly out of leaving her son and partly of gratitude to Benedictine for the \"golden ticket\" their family had received to enroll him.Moore consoled and celebrated with her and gave her a hug.Benedictine has students from 16 different counties and several states including Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia. Evans said most of the students from Maryland are publicly funded. Benedictine currently has room for 36 residential students on campus and is looking with the expansion to get to 48.\"A lot of what we get is what public schools can't handle. So we set up an environment so they can be safe as they are learning and we are helping them to manage those behaviors and learn new ways,\" Hickey said.\"That is really what our goal is. Last year we had 148 referrals, and we have taken 12.\" A tough issue is attracting the best teachers. One classroom had two students, one teacher and two assistants.It is intense and rewarding work that pays about as much as Applebee's. It is about as hard to get a placement as getting into an Ivy League college. One state-level fix is the service year option that could get younger workers involved with this meaningful work. Evans called this work life changing.Benedictine is a non-sectarian, non-religious nonprofit organization supporting close to 200 children and adults with developmental disabilities and autism to achieve their greatest potential and highest level of independence. Benedictine's year-round educational program is one of only 22 nationwide to earn a two-year accreditation from the National Commission for Accreditation of Special Education Services.Benedictine's Adult Services program offers employment and vocational services for transitional youth and adults, ages 22 to 70 and beyond, in the community and those who live in Benedictine's group homes in Caroline, Talbot and Anne Arundel counties. Benedictine is one of only four residential facilities for the developmentally disabled and autistic that can accept students with moderate to severe challenges.Benedictine is one of the Eastern Shore's largest employers with 350 employees. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY TOM MCCALL/TMCCALL@CHESPUB.COM\n \nGov.

Everyone is \"starving\" by lunchtime especially the ones who had no breakfast.My mom had that big pot of oatmeal ready, and she made sure we had a bowl of it! I am exploring the 1940s when my older brothers and sister went to school. Mom always had at least three or more children in school and would pack their lunches.Lunches were packed in round tin pails with handles or the ever-popular generational brown bag. Their lunch would consist of a biscuit with a piece of meat or maybe a piece of cornbread with leftover meat from supper the night before.Water from school to drink, an apple or whatever was available and in season. When they got home from school there would be a snack consisting of fruit or leftovers from the night before.The 1940s-style cafeteria in the little Bishopville school was part of a six-room school consisting of four classrooms (two grades per room), two bathrooms (one male and one female), one multipurpose room - cafeteria-gym-auditorium-meeting room - and a storage room for everything from toilet tissue to chalk to cleaning supplies to canned goods! Then came the 1950s with changes to the school that included a large room converted to a cafeteria complete with a big cook stove, an actual cook, tables and chairs, but the room still converted to a gym, auditorium and meeting room.If you bought lunch, the food was placed on the ugliest dark brown, heavy plastic tray ever. No matter what food you were served that day there was a small dish of applesauce on the corner of the tray. The dessert was usually a small square of brownie, gingerbread, square of yellow sheet cake with frosting or a small bowl of Jello. The late Mrs. Lynch was our cook who lived locally and whose car was parked there every morning about 6 a.m. Mrs. Lynch and Mr. Hudson, the custodian, were employed there for many years. The only other part-timer was \"Albert,\" a local boy who helped peel vegetables, carry heavy pots, scrub down tables, whatever Mrs.Lynch needed help with, AND he ate lunch with us and pushed us on the swings! We all dearly loved the \"workers\" at our little country school!Attending this school from first grade through sixth, we packed lunches and occasionally bought lunch. Foods packed were usually leftovers from supper the night before.One popular sandwich was a meatloaf sandwich. It seemed no matter what the main sandwich was, the sides were always a fat dill pickle, a few chips, and a cookie with water. In the 1940s and '50s other popular packed lunches were potted meat, tuna fish, peanut butter and jelly, bologna and cheese sandwiches, any kind of leftover supper meat from the night before, and I cannot forget the popular Spam sandwich.On a cold wintry morning Mrs. Lynch would have several large pots of vegetable or bean soup cooking and the delicious aroma would travel all over the school. The only aroma that was better was the one of tomato soup and grilled cheese!Then came the late 1950s and the early 1960s! We left our little country school to go to the \"big school\" - high school - which for us was Stephen Decatur. Here we met up with many more \"city kids\" than ever. The country kids, the city kids all blended in together and compared our lifestyles. One thing we all had in common, we were starving at lunchtime! I must share this lunch story with you. Several girls and I became close friends and remained so for many years. \"Nellie\" was from Berlin, \"Sue\" was from Ocean City, \"Sandy\" was from St. Martins and then me from Bishopville.We sat at the same table every day and we usually packed lunch every day - usually consisting of leftovers from the night before. I had a meatloaf sandwich, Sandy had tuna fish, and Sue had lunch meat with cheese. We were busy chatting and eating when I looked over at Nellie, whose brown bag was stained on the outside. I asked Nellie \"what did you bring?\" Nellie said \"leftover fried beef tongue\" from last night - the three of us screamed, jumped up and ran gagging to the bathroom!Then came my children going to school in the 1970s and 1980s. School cafeterias had changed greatly by this time. In middle school there was a jukebox, round tables as well as the long style and a \"huge\" change in school food.Some lunches were spaghetti with meatballs, garlic bread and a salad. There were submarines with small bags of chips, and the ever popular \"a la carte\" foods. You could purchase candy bars, ice cream, individual sandwiches and add a bowl of soup. Lunch boxes turned into lunch bags or insulated bags.Packed lunches in the '80s and '90s included foods like beef jerky, cheese sticks, hot chips and pop-top cans of soups. Lunch had very few sandwiches as students would buy lunch on \"pizza days\" and \"taco days.\" Potato bars, taco bars, Lunchables, Chef Boyardee pop top cans, juice box drinks - all changed the landscape of lunch time.Schools started serving breakfast, lunch and afternoon snacks.Since my parents operated a store in town for a few years, we usually saw the families that would come in and \"buy on credit,\" which usually wasn't much. Flour, corn meal, bacon and maybe sugar when the crops were good. I was taught to help. I saw my mother for years on Sundays feed many hungry neighbors who maybe hadn't eaten for a few days. She'd pick tomatoes or corn from her garden and leave them on doorsteps. If we had it, our less fortunate neighbors also had it and vice versa. I miss those days.Now we are exploring school lunches from 2000 to 2023. Most schools are now offering two or three different lunch choices and that ever so popular a la carte menu.As I close this column today, I realize going back in time brings back so many memories of my school years! From the bus drivers - mostly men who lived locally, had local jobs, were farmers, members of our local fire department and who attended our small church. So, hiding mischief was a \"no go\" as one glance of their eyes meant \"momma and poppa\" run the local store and I will be stopping by there after the morning run! Our cafeteria \"ladies\" were mostly locals from our small town, and they cooked like \"mom.\" Our two teachers and one principal-teacher were from Ocean City and owned a hotel where several students' families worked. A community park is now in the spot where Bishopville Elementary School once stood. As I look at where the school once stood, I am flooded with memories.No matter what type of lunch bag or box you carried, no matter what kind of biscuit or bread you used, and no matter what kind of filling was on that sandwich, we were all the same children from a small town!Those sandwiches were all the same - peanut butter with jelly or jam or honey. Eskay bologna and cheese or Spam and mustard. Leftover meatloaf or a piece of leftover fried chicken. Tuna fish or a piece of bread wrapped around a cold piece of leftover fried tongue - that was for you Nellie!Have a wonderful 2023-2024 school year y'all! \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Maari's mother participated in the 4-H Development Program for Youth 35 years ago, visiting Illinois at age 15 - the same age as Maari.Tina Squibb, faculty member of the University of Maryland Extension program and host mom to Maari, has two daughters close to Maari's age and said it has been a wonderful experience for the whole family to get to know her.\"Maari was asked by the mayor of her city to present to local leadership (in Queen Anne's County) and she would like to read a letter from the mayor to the Commission,\" Squibb said.The letter from Ishi Toshiro, mayor of Nishinomiya, said the town \"is known as the cultural, educational and residential city.\" Residents of Nishinomiya (population 484,000) are flanked by the Rokko mountain range and the Osaka Bay. Toshiro closed his letter by saying, \"Young people dream big dreams and are filled with enthusiasm to make them happen,\" and thanked the commission for the opportunity for Maari to share a bit of her culture.Maari then presented the commissioners with several gifts from Japan and read a story called \"The Sky Blue Seed.\" Dr. Jinhee Kim, associate dean/associate director of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, attended as well.\"Students in the 4-H program from Maryland are visiting other countries and there are currently 10 Japanese students visiting Maryland,\" Kim said.Maryland 4-H partners provide students with the opportunity to travel to foreign countries for a cultural immersion experience. Delegates live with volunteer host families and engage in experiential learning about a new way of life. The intention of the program is for students' experiences to deepen their understanding of their host culture as well as their own. \n \n Caption: Maari Murakawa, 15, and her host \"sibling\" Jamie Squibb, 16, enjoy a night of music and dinner at Doc's Riverside Grill in Centreville.\n \nCOURTESY OF TINA SQUIBB \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It sure feels like it.I just read that as a nation, we will spend $41.5 billion getting our kids outfitted to go back to school this fall. And by outfitted I mean with all the \"proper\" electronic gear, shoes with all the bells and whistles (I would like a pair of those sneakers with little wheels embedded in the soles), backpacks, instruments and of course the ever-popular school supplies.Yikes! That's a whole lotta money.Granted, I don't have school-aged children anymore, but come on! The average elementary schooler's must-haves in school supplies, extracurricular fees and technology this year comes in at $1,017; for middle school students, it's $1,277; and for high school kids, $1,668 each, according to the 13th annual Backpack Index survey from Huntington Bank in Columbus, Ohio.Spreading the cost over the school year seems more reasonable to me, unless it's notebook paper, pens and paper. Those are so cheap right now at office supply stores, you really should stock up for the entire year.And while we're on the subject, let's throw fundraisers into the discussion.Every year about this time I get a flood of messages that are some variation of, \"I am so sick of my kids bringing home catalogs full of cheap, overpriced stuff that the school expects us to sell. How can we deal with this? I'd love some advice and insight on how other parents do it.\" So, how do you deal with school supplies, outfits and fundraisers?

    "content": "Uncommon classes: How pop culture imagines Jesus, from cartoons to musicals - Images of Jesus have always been complex and contradictory\n\n August 28, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jeannie Sellick; Bowdoin College The Conversation | Page: A4 | Section: News \n \n 735\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Uncommon Courses is an occasional series from The Conversation U.S. highlighting unconventional approaches to teaching.TITLE OF COURSE:\"Jesus in the Modern Imagination\"WHAT PROMPTED THE IDEA FOR THE COURSE?My only real exposure to religion while growing up was \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" - the 1973 film version of the much-debated Broadway musical. Every Easter, my parents would throw it on, and I listened to the soundtrack on repeat until I knew every word.My journey to studying religion was really a happy accident. I had always been enamored by ancient history and planned to research gender and sexuality in the ancient Mediterranean. An adviser suggested I look to early Christianity - and from the moment I first read about Mary of Egypt, a prostitute who became a saint in the desert, I was hooked.When I finally started graduate work in religious studies, I knew next to nothing about the Bible.\"Superstar\" and other biblically inspired musicals like \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" were my primary reference points. Drawing comparisons in class, I realized how much of my understanding of religious narratives had been shaped by pop culture.I knew I probably wasn't alone in this, so I designed a course that explores the relationship between religion and media.WHAT DOES THE COURSE EXPLOreftAlthough the course has \"modern\" in the title, a lot of what students and I do is to look at ancient depictions of Jesus and compare it to more modern films, comics and music.For example, I teach a unit on the \"lost years\" of Jesus' life. The four canonical gospels in the Bible either completely ignore Jesus' youth or basically jump from his birth to his adult life. This gap naturally leads to questions: What was Jesus like as a kid? Was he very pious? A troublemaker?This is where apocryphal sources - early Christian literature that wasn't included in official versions of the Bible - can start to fill in the gaps. Students discuss the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, a second-century narrative about Jesus' childhood.This text depicts Jesus disobeying his parents, talking back and even killing people with his divine powers, though he resurrects them all in the end. We read this alongside portions of novelist Christopher Moore's book \"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal.\" Moore's 2002 comedy depicts a teenage Jesus traveling around the world in order to learn how to become the messiah.But every time you try to fill one gap, even more questions pop up.For example, it may sound silly, but did Jesus, whom the canonical gospels portray as a bachelor, ever have a crush? If he did, would that change conversations about celibacy and sexuality? Once we start peeling back these layers of what we can and cannot know, and how different depictions of Jesus have imagined him, it always leads to really fascinating classroom conversations.WHY IS THIS COURSE RELEVANT NOW?Jesus is a perpetually contested figure. Is Jesus a teacher of peace or a warrior? A socialist or a capitalist sympathizer? Is he the manliest man to ever exist or a transgressively feminine figureft Depending who you ask, American Christians see Christ as all these things and more.These are hot-button questions, ones that influence individuals and whole societies. But they cannot be easily answered - or sometimes answered at all - by the Bible.Understandings of Jesus are also deeply shaped by people's cultures, norms and desires, which we see reflected in everything from second-century texts to modern comics and Monty Python's \"Life of Brian.\" This course does not attempt to answer the question, \"Who was Jesus?\" However, it examines how humanity has grappled with it, both historically and today.WHAT WILL THE COURSE PREPARE STUDENTS TO DO?Above all, this course gives students the tools to better analyze how interpretations of religious and historical figures are shaped by the communities that imagine and re-imagine them. It allows the class to see just how complicated religious figures like Jesus are and to analyze the motivations behind specific interpretations.Oh, and students also get to make their own Jesus movies at the end of the semester - which is pretty awesome.The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

    "content": "Students paying less for college than 15 years ago\n\n August 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George F. Will | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 757\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - From sea to shining sea, the shining faces of young people are turning expectantly toward another year in the groves of academe. Heading for college, they leave behind parents who might understandably be bewildered about the price of higher education.(Higher than what?It's complicated, and a question for another day.)There is ample evidence that colleges mangle the truth about so many subjects (e.g., history, contemporary life, how literature should be studied, freedom of expression on campuses, etc.) that it should not surprise anyone that the counterintuitive reality about tuition is deliberately obscured - and cunningly complicated.Fortunately, Dan Currell has entertainingly dispelled the manufactured mists that engulf \"The Truth about College Costs,\" which is the title of his astringent essay in the summer issue of National Affairs. Formerly a senior adviser at the Education Department, Currell has glad tidings: \"Students are paying less for college than they did 15 years ago.\" This is, as Currell knows, \"deeply contrary to conventional wisdom,\" but the reason for it is hiding in plain sight: \"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, colleges discovered that the appearance of high tuition was good for marketing.\" Since then, they have toiled to keep \"nearly invisible\" the fact that 96 percent of students pay about $15,000 a year for tuition.Add $10,000 for room and board, and the $25,000 total is a far cry from the eye-watering numbers that colleges are actually pleased to have bandied about.A few highly selective colleges educate a \"small and highly unrepresentative\" fraction of students. \"The top 100 private schools enroll around 500,000 students,\" while the other 2,600 four-year schools enroll about 10.5 million.Most of the elite schools could fill their annual enrollments several times over with the children of the affluent who would gladly pay the advertised tuition - even much more. Most of these elite institutions have, however, large endowments that enable generous tuition assistance for the less affluent. For the other 2,500 institutions, a sleight of hand is the basic business practice.The Economist largely validates Currell's thesis. It reports that the average tuition paid by students at their home-state public colleges is about $10,000, and that private colleges discount tuition by more than 50 percent on average. \"The College Board, a non-profit, shows that whereas published tuition and fees for private nonprofit colleges increased from $29,000 in 2006-07 to $38,000 in 2021-22 (in 2021 dollars), the net price actually decreased from $17,000 to $15,000. The story is similar for public colleges. Published tuition and fees were nearly $8,000 in 2006-07 and rose to nearly $11,000 in 2021-22, but the net cost fell by $730.\" But, the Economist says, schools have \"an incentive to seem extortionate:\" \"Consumers tend to associate higher prices with higher quality.\" (Currell: \"Bowdoin's published tuition today is $4,000 higher than Harvard's.\") The Economist adds, \"students (and their boastful parents) are flattered by tuition markdowns pitched as merit scholarships rather than discounts.\" The discounts often are, Currell says, \"institutional scholarships\" with no money behind them. \"By 1999,\" he says, \"the fundamental dishonesty of college pricing had become clear\": \"That year, American private colleges purported to award scholarships worth more than all the tuition they collected - which is to say, their average discount had exceeded 50%.\" That explains this faux mystery: Colleges ostensibly cost $50,000 a year, \"but,\" Currell says drolly, \"they are somehow also running out of money.\" The not at all mysterious reality is, Currell says, that \"the apparent rise in tuition after the mid-1990s\" is \"almost entirely illusory.\" \"In fact,\" Currell says, \"if a typical college collected its sticker price in full, its leaders would hardly know what to do with all the money.\" For example, Beloit College, a Wisconsin liberal arts school with a $43 million budget, would have an extra $26 million.Colleges can minimize their discounts by instead steering parents toward having government provide the discount with subsidized student loans.Among the social costs of what Currell calls the \"fundamental dishonesty\" about college pricing is today's mountain of college debt: \"Many families simply believe there is a $200,000 tollbooth on the road to the American dream, so they sign the loan forms.\" Academia has appointed itself the nation's moral tutor whose duty is to make Americans remorseful about almost everything, including deceptive practices that the tutor insists characterize unsavory capitalism. So, it is fun to have Currell's demonstration that our supposed moral betters have practices that are, to use one of their favorite words, problematic.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nNew graduates line up before the start of a community college commencement in 2018 \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No application is needed.\"This is a wonderful program for our county with having over 3,000 of our students on free meals already and a significant amount of our students missed the free threshold by being over the income level by $50,\" said Beth Brewster, supervisor of food services for the school district.Caroline County school cafeterias will still charge for extra items like snacks. Families should continue to register with MySchoolBucks to pay for extra items in the cafeteria or school activities as directed.According to the USDA website, the Community Eligibility Provision is a non-pricing meal service option for schools and school districts in low-income areas.CEP allows the nation's highest poverty schools and districts to serve breakfast and lunch at no cost to all enrolled students without collecting household applications.Instead, schools that adopt the program are reimbursed using a formula based on the percentage of students eligible for free meals based on their participation in other means-tested programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.\"To qualify for CEP a district has to have 40% of their free (meal) students directly certified by the state that they are free,\" Brewster wrote in an Aug. 28 email.\"When qualifying for free meals through the application process the gross salary is the income that is taken, not the net.\" \"Last year, CCPS had close to a 66% free and reduced rate for school meals. Dorchester and Somerset have been CEP for a few years,\" she wrote.\"Some districts have a few schools that qualify so they may have a few schools within the district that are CEP not the whole district. We will have districtwide CEP,\" Brewster wrote.\"We have had very sad stories of families having medical issues or trouble paying rent or their mortgage that did not qualify,\" Brewster said. \"This makes it an even playing field for our children to have access to nutritious meals that allows them to develop their gray brain matter and come to school ready to learn.\" \"No child should be hungry or wonder where their next meal is coming from,\" she said.CCPS Food Services supports local farmers and businesses in its quest to provide local products.According to the Caroline County Public Schools website, each summer Food Services personnel \"process locally sourced produce to utilize throughout the school year. Not only is it good for local businesses, it is great for the environment and more nutritious for our students.\" For more information about the USDA's Community Eligibility Provision program, visit fns-prod. azureedge.us/sites/default/files/cn/CEPfactsheet.pdf.For more information about CCPS Food Services, call 410-479-3261 or visit www.carolineschools.org/o/ccps/page/food-services. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Holt Scholarship Fund at Mid-Shore Community Foundation celebrated its 10th anniversary this year by awarding $560,000 in scholarships to deserving Caroline County students.Over the last 10 years, the fund has awarded $2.8 million.The story behind the fund is about a successful woman from Caroline County who wanted her assets to be used toward bettering her fellow man - specifically supporting the educational endeavors of students in need of financial support to achieve their goals.Roberta \"Bobbie\" Baxter Holt was a native of Federalsburg. She graduated from Federalsburg High School and then received her bachelor's degree in sociology at the University of Delaware, a master's degree in social work at the University of Minnesota, and a doctorate in social work from the Catholic University of America.She was a research associate in the laboratory of Brain Evolution and Behavior at the National Institutes of Mental Health and had a long successful career as a psychotherapist with a family-oriented practice in Chevy Chase, Maryland.She also served on the faculty of Georgetown University in what is now the Bowen Center for the Study of the Family. She lived in Chevy Chase, Maryland, and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.\"She remained connected to her Federalsburg roots. She exemplified her personal philosophy of doing something productive every day to further yourself or humankind.She was determined to use her success and the assets of her estate to encourage others to do the same. Her brother, Haines Holt, established this extraordinary scholarship program to fulfill her commitment to education,\" said Buck Duncan, president of MSCF.Education was something Bobbie valued.Haines said, \"As the executor of her estate, I knew she wanted the funds to help people in Caroline County further their education.\" Although Bobbie never had children of her own, she influenced many children, including the life of one of her closest friends who shared her memories of Bobbie, stating, \"She came from a small provincial town, went far, and yet remained humble She was a supportive friend to young people. My daughter asked, 'Did she have a glimmer of the impact she had on peopleft'\" Bobbie was exposed to the needs of the Caroline County community while working as a volunteer toward the end of her life with the Caroline County Department of Social Services.Mid-Shore Community Foundation awards scholarships to high school seniors in Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's, and Talbot Counties. In FY23, MSCF awarded 221 scholarships, totaling $1.7 Million.The majority of the Foundation's scholarships, including the Roberta B.

    "content": "University of Maryland Eastern Shore increases enrollment once again\n\n September 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A12 | Section: News \n \n 712\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n PRINCESS ANNE - The University of Maryland Eastern Shore will have a third consecutive year of increased new student enrollment and is on pace to surpass the largest influx of freshmen and transfer students in eight years.In the fall of 2022, 733 new undergraduate students were enrolled at UMES, which was shy of the 1,011 students who came to Princess Anne at the start of the 2015 school year.\"Currently, we have 825 new students enrolled, and we continue to push the needle to welcome in as many students as we're capable of serving,\" said Latoya Jenkins, UMES's vice president of enrollment management and student experience.\"I think that ultimately we'll surpass the largest class we had in 2015, but we still have work to do to ultimately see where we will end up,\" she said.The increased enrollment numbers at UMES are following a national trend which has seen continual new student growth at Historically Black Colleges and Universities since 2020.The drive to increase enrollment has been one of the initiatives driven by President Heidi M. Anderson since the return to campus following the pandemic. Jenkins said President Anderson challenged them to not only to continue to increase enrollment, but also enhance retention efforts, which has seen a 10 percent uptick.As part of the mission to raise student enrollment, the admissions and recruitment department has worked on strategies to not only raise awareness of the UMES brand to students and parents, but strengthen connections with stakeholders according to Darryl Isom, director of admissions and recruitment.\"I've been here about two years, and when I initially came on board, the determination was that the UMES brand really needed to be defined,\" Isom said. \"We needed to get a unified message into the community, into our feeder schools, and into the nation of what we really are about, our unique programs, our family atmosphere, and how we have all the resources of a research institution but the feel of a very small liberal arts school and that has really resonated.\" Isom also attributes the gains to the outstanding work of his admissions and recruitment staff, which continues to expand.\"We're seeing the benefits of that where our name, our brand, our name recognition is really growing locally as we had to re-penetrate and reinforce our mission locally with our local market, nationally, and even internationally to a certain extent,\" he said. \"My team has gotten out there and really told the story of UMES and what a really wonderful institution this is. So that has been very instrumental in the pivot that we did initially in terms of our recruiting strategy.\" That recruiting strategy includes the use of a regional ad campaign through Baltimore-based tbc Inc., targeting the New York City, Philadelphia, Norfolk and Atlanta, Salisbury and the Baltimore/Washington D.C. markets. In addition to the campaign, UMES partnered with consulting firms such as Ruffalo Noel Levitz geared to helping UMES create best practices for enrollment management.Recruiting isn't the only focus. There is also an emphasis on registering transfer students, which include junior and community college graduates. So far, an estimated 200 transfer students are expected to make their way to Princess Anne.Jenkins said as a result of partnerships with institutions including Wor-Wic Community College, UMES has been able to share its stories and information about the rate of success students with two-year degrees have at the university.\"When students transfer from Wor-Wic to UMES, they do better and graduate in less time to complete their four-year degree,\" she said. \"That's not something UMES or Wor-Wic made up, that's baked in our data from the national clearinghouse.\" As the student population and campus community continues to grow and new academic courses are unveiled such as the new online and continuing education programs, Jenkins said one of the long-term goals is to return enrollment numbers back to pre-pandemic levels, something which is not out of the realm of possibility, but will involve continual progress.\"We have talked about charting the heights of our enrollment that was, in 2017, upwards of the times which we had around 4,000 students,\" she said. \"I think that coming out of a pandemic and where our institution is, we are poised to grow, but it will take us some time to get back to those numbers.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bullying lawsuit in Dorchester County Court\n\n September 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: A3 | Section: News \n \n 620\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - A jury trial is underway in an extensive lawsuit alleging negligence from Dorchester County Public Schools administrators and teachers in handling bullying and harassment of a former Mace's Lane Middle School student.Filed in Dorchester County Circuit Court in May 2018, the lawsuit alleges negligence from faculty and staff at the middle school while a former student was experiencing numerous instances of bullying, harassment and assault.Defendants named in the complaint include the Dorchester County Board of Education; James Bell, DCPS supervisor of student services; Cynitha Woolford, assistant principal at Mace's Lane Middle School; Michael Collins, former principal of Mace's Lane Middle School; and two unnamed substitute teachers.Court filings allege that the six defendants encouraged and covered up the behavior, and directly participated in the harassment and bullying by punishing plaintiff Sierra Gambrill \"without cause or due process.\" The conduct in question occurred when Gambrill was in sixth grade during the 2016-2017 school year.The plaintiffs in the case - Gambrill and her parents - said that Gambrill experienced bullying and assault from multiple students at the middle school, including hair pulling, name calling, hitting and other physical attacks, over the course of the year.Some attacks against Gambrill increased in severity as the year progressed, plaintiffs said.In October 2016, Gambrill was in a science class with a substitute teacher when two male classmates physically beat her head and body. Gambrill rushed to Woolford's office to report the attack, but the assistant principal sent Gambrill home without ensuring that she received medical treatment. Gambrill sustained a concussion from that incident, the plaintiffs asserted.The Gambrill family reported the attack to Collins, but said that Collins told them that substitute teachers are not trained well, cannot control the classroom and that \"boys will be boys,\" according to a statement of facts filed by the plaintiffs.A second violent incident occurred in a science class on Dec. 14, 2016, while students were under the supervision of another substitute teacher.Plaintiffs said Gambrill was attacked by another male student, who grabbed her neck and flipped her backward, causing her to strike her head. Gambrill suffered another concussion from the attack.The plaintiffs said the second substitute teacher witnessed the attack and allowed it to happen \"without any intervention.\" The same student who assaulted Gambrill on Dec. 14 struck her in the face on Dec. 19, 2016, while both were at the nurse's office, plaintiffs said.Gambrill attempted to defend herself by pushing the student away, but was never given an opportunity to tell her side of the story.Plaintiffs said that Woolford failed to investigate the incident and \"immediately\" handed Gambrill a two-day out-of-school suspension as punishment.Attorneys for the family said that the defendants \"exacted unjustified discipline\" on Gambrill that year through suspensions, denying her attendance on school trips and requiring her to sit alone at lunch. Woolford reportedly harassed Gambrill by sending her home to change clothes, according to the court filing.Plaintiffs assert that the defendants failed to properly address the family's concerns for Gambrill's safety and failed to properly supervise and train substitute teachers.In June 2019, a judge in Dorchester County Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts that remained, including the negligence claim.The Gambrill family appealed the circuit court's ruling on the negligence claim in July 2019. About two years later, the Appellate Court of Maryland affirmed the lower court's ruling.The Gambrill family filed a second appeal to the Supreme Court of Maryland shortly after. But last August, the state's highest court reversed both lower rulings and remanded the case back to Dorchester County for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.The trial is expected to conclude Friday, according to court records. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY CHRISTINA AU FDERHEIDE \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Board members asked questions about how the schools plan to track progress, address staffing vacancies and what things the board and community can do to help the schools reach their goals.Throughout the rest of the meeting, board members asked questions, initiated conversations and probed deeper about many of the meeting's agenda items.At the end of the meeting, board member Theresa Stafford gave her hopes for the school year.\"I hope that as we move forward as a board, the community does not have to guess where we are and where we're going,\" she said.\"This year we will be transparent in everything we do.\" Stafford said conversations are healthy and that hard conversations need to happen.\"One of the first things in moving forward,\" she said, \"(is) we have to be realistic.And we may not paint a rosy picture that everybody this year is going to sit here and smile and agree.\" Stafford said that, as board members, listening to the community and supporting teachers is vital.\"We are the voice of the people who elected us to make sure that we are doing the best we can for the kids we have and for the community that we serve,\" she said.Board member Chris Wheedleton said he's excited about making data-driven decisions this school year. He said there a plans for a new dashboard that will show whether progress on student outcomes is being made in the district.\"We're putting ourselves to account and making sure that we can really report where we're seeing progress,\" he said.Wheedleton also talked about the importance of having civil and constructive conversations as a board. He said that this can go handin-hand with data-driven decision making.\"I think that's an important message for our kids to hear as we go back into school as well - that civility and data can actually go together,\" he said. \"It's all about us looking at the data and then making really smart decisions about what we do.\" School Board President Susan Morgan said it's going to take collaboration to effect change.\"There's no reason that Dorchester County can't be the best county on the Eastern Shore for education,\" she said. \"To do that though, we need a little bit more help.We need help from parents, guardians, grandparents, anyone who has a child in our system.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nDorchester County Board of Education Member Theresa Stafford speaks during a Board of Education meeting Aug. 17 in Cambridge.\n \nMAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nDorchester County Board of Education Member Chris Wheedleton speaks during a Board of Education meeting Aug. 17 in Cambridge. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "author": "Local News Network University Of Maryland's Philip Merrill College Of Journalism",
    "content": "'Contracted Out' - An unprecedented look at Maryland public school spending\n\n September 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Local News Network University Of Maryland's Philip Merrill College Of Journalism | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1156\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Billions of local, state and federal tax dollars go to funding Maryland's public schools every year - and now, it will be easier for you to find out how your local school district spent that money.That's because the Local News Network at the University of Maryland has published an easily searchable database where you can look up your school district's vendor payments over the past four years.That database and an accompanying series of stories comprise \"Contracted Out,\" a project compiled over the past seven months by students and faculty at the UMD Philip Merrill College of Journalism. The \"Contracted Out\" database provides a comprehensive and unprecedented itemization of school contract spending statewide.\"If there is any corruption out there, it's through these contracts,\" said Marguerite Roza, director of Georgetown University's Edunomics Lab, a research institute that studies education funding data.\"Contracted Out\" gives local journalists and the general public something they've never had before: an easy way to review school district vendor payments.The \"Contracted Out\" database contains information from all 24 public school districts in Maryland, with the ability to break out individual districts. The database includes every vendor that was paid over $25,000 by each district between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years.The Local News Network turned more than 26,000 rows of raw data into news the public can use. School district payments for health insurance, buses, computers and meals - it's all there.Still, there are limits to the data.Vendor payments account for only a small portion of school funding in Maryland or any other state. Roza said the vast majority of school spending - 80% to 90% of it - goes to teacher and staff salaries, not vendors.The data used to construct the \"Contracted Out\" database - most of it obtained through the state's Open Data Portal - lacks detail. Most districts only have to report payments of more than $25,000, the name of the vendor and the ZIP code where the vendor is based. A quirk in state law requires only Baltimore County Public Schools to say why they spent what they spent.School districts have differing policies regarding which services they contract out and which they handle in-house. For example, some districts have their own bus fleets while others hire contractors to transport students.Districts also disagree on what constitutes a vendor payment. Most notably, some list state and federal taxes as vendor payments, but others exclude them from the data. For that reason, any district-by-district comparison of overall vendor payments would not be statistically valid.Even so, the data that's online serves a useful purpose, said Matthew Streett, assistant director in the state's Office of Legislative Audits.\"I look at it from a transparency and accountability standpoint,\" Streett said. \"The public wants to know where their taxpayer dollars are going when it comes to educating students.\" Streett's office routinely audits school district spending, as do district officials and inspector general offices in individual counties.Meanwhile, the Office of the State Inspector General for Education performs audits based on tips about possible wrongdoing.You can find details about some of the recent audits here.Those audits can spot big trouble. For example, an internal review of contracting in Montgomery County Public Schools last year found evidence of irregularities in the district's transportation department. A criminal investigation then led to a guilty plea to a felony theft charge by the department's former assistant director, as well as a guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge by the department's former director.But the checks and balances on school spending don't depend primarily on auditors and investigators.School boards review and authorize vendor payments, said Milton E. Nagel, executive director of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education.\"Maryland procurement laws apply to school districts,\" he said. \"School districts can't go out and stroke a million-dollar check to a vendor without going through a bid process.\" But Roza said school boards rarely go over vendor contracts line by line.\"They end up going into a consent agenda, and the whole board goes, 'Everybody want to approve the 91 contracts that we have coming before the board this month? All in favor? Aye,'\" she said.In most states, those contracts are published only in a school board's minutes, not online like in Maryland, Roza said.But the Local News Network found big problems with the school contracting data on the state's Open Data Portal.When work on the project began in January, huge chunks of data from four of the five largest school districts in the state were missing.Data was missing from several smaller districts, too - even though a 2019 act of the General Assembly requires districts to report vendor payments of over $25,000 with the Department of Budget and Management.Student journalists and Local News Network Director Jerry Zremski spent months prodding districts to comply with the law and provide the missing data.The last to do so, Baltimore City and Baltimore County, didn't do that until early June.Derek Willis, lecturer in computational and data journalism at Merrill College, then completed the work his students had begun: cleaning up the data so that every vendor was listed by the same name.A team of 38 student journalists reviewed the incomplete data before the spring semester ended and Zremski studied the late-arriving data.Their key findings will be included in the accompanying stories, but local journalists around the state and citizens may also want to take a close look at the data. As Roza noted, the people closest to the local school districts - reporters and citizens who live in those districts - will be the ones most likely to spot questionable vendor payments.In doing so, Roza said, people should remember one thing about school district vendor data: scandal can be rooted in them. She cited a case from Chicago, where the former CEO of the public school district ended up spending nearly three years in federal prison because she steered tens of millions in no-bid contracts to her friends.And Richard Henry, the state's inspector general for education, encouraged the public to contact his office if they see anything in the contracting data that seems suspicious.\"I always encourage individuals to give us a call, and if they want to remain anonymous, they can remain anonymous,\" Henry said.\"We continue to encourage outreach to all members of the education profession throughout the state and throughout the county governments to report any type of waste, fraud and abuse.\" Local News Network Director Jerry Zremski compiled this story based in part on the work of 38 Philip Merrill College of Journalism students who were enrolled in a mid-level reporting class in the spring semester.Kara Thompson of the Capital News Service Annapolis Bureau and Joel Lev-Tov, an independent study student with the Local News Network, contributed to this report. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nThe Talbot County Public Schools Education Foundation aims to close the \"digital divide\" that impacts hundreds of Talbot County students.\n \nAPG STAFF\n \nThis graph reflects the amount spent by the five Mid-Shore county school districts by vendor. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Audits show trouble lurking in school contracts\n\n September 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Kayla Nazaire; Capital News Service | Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 929\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Auditors keep a close eye on school district contracting in Maryland - and if you're wondering why, just look at what happened in May in Montgomery County.After auditors raised suspicions, the district's former assistant director of transportation pleaded guilty to stealing over $320,000 from the county's school system over a span of at least five years by misusing district purchasing cards and mismanaging a contract for the purchase of school buses.What's more, several state audits in recent years raised serious questions about contract spending in other Maryland public school districts.Richard P. Henry, Maryland's inspector general for education, acknowledged the possibility that officials in other school districts could be misusing the school contracting system.\"You know, we don't find out all the time, but there will always be some individuals who will take advantage of flaws in the system, and you know, possibly profit from it or use it to their advantage,\" Henry said.County or district officials frequently audit local school districts in Maryland.On top of that, the state Office of Legislative Audits reviews the books of each school district once every six years, whereas the Maryland Office of the Inspector General for Education takes complaints from the public and investigates them.But audits, while helpful, can only identify problems. It is up to the districts to implement solutions - and often they don't. The Office of Legislative Audits released an audit of the Maryland State Department of Education in January. Auditors found 171 repeated findings that local school systems had yet to address from previous audits.Matthew Streett, assistant director of the Compliance and Performance Audit Division in the Office of Legislative Audits, said school districts should take audit findings seriously.\"I think it's important to safeguard the assets because ultimately, when you're talking about money that flows through the school system, it's all intended to help educate the students, and if money is being diverted, it's less money that's intended for the classroom and students,\" Streett said.Public school districts in Montgomery County, Baltimore City, Howard County, Charles County and Calvert County have all been audited in recent years. Concerns raised in those audits range from unauthorized transactions to insufficient documentation to justify major purchases.In addition, the audits found that nearly every school district failed to complete proper documentation for approval of intergovernmental purchasing agreements. In many cases, employees made purchases without documenting why they were necessary and beneficial to the district.Here's a detailed look at what auditors and investigators found in recent years in those individual school districts: MONTGOMERY COUNTYAuditors have found a number of issues with school district contracting in Montgomery County, but none more serious than the one that led to guilty pleas from two district transportation department officials this year.In May, Charles Ewald, the district's former assistant transportation director, pleaded guilty to one count of felony theft and one misdemeanor count of misconduct in office.Court records said Ewald used his position to request checks from an \"off-the-books\" account held by one of the district's longtime bus vendors, American Truck & Bus Inc. The money came from late fee and change fee reimbursements owed to the district - and, according to court documents, $352,568.68 of it went directly to Ewald's bank account. In addition, Ewald had the bus vendor issue about $16,000 in checks to other school district staff members.Todd Watkins, the former director of the transportation department, pleaded guilty in June to one count of misconduct in office, and not just because he failed to fulfill his role of overseeing the department's expenses. Watkins was the one who coordinated with American Truck & Bus to establish the \"offthe-books\" account, court records said.Watkins received more than $13,000 using the account and intentionally violated the district's reimbursement policy, but he provided documentation for those payments and was not charged with theft.A judge will sentence Ewald and Watkins in September, closing a criminal case that began with an internal review in 2021.Then last December, the Montgomery County Office of the Inspector General found that school district transportation department officials used school funds to pay for a NASCAR headset, drag racing tires, a sport loop band for an Apple Watch, a car roof rack for kayaks, Home Depot and Amazon gift cards, along with other personal items. The purchases totaled nearly $5,000.In response to the audit, Montgomery County Public Schools officials confirmed all the findings were factually accurate and outlined procedures they planned to implement to correct the problems.CALVERT COUNTYThe state Office of Legislative Audits reported in January 2022 that Calvert County Public Schools took shortcuts in the spending approval process and failed to monitor whether their vendors were billing them correctly.The lack of oversight on the district's financial systems allowed individual departments and schools to make purchases while skipping necessary procurement processes, auditors said.Auditors raised questions about the district's transportation costs. Compared to other comparable-sized districts, Calvert County schools paid 22 cents per mile more for transportation.In addition, the district paid over a half-million dollars in bus operations fees without providing any reasonable justification for these transportation costs.On other contracts, the district didn't check to see if the price written on the invoice from vendors matched the pricing agreed to in the contract. The audit found five payments in intergovernmental contract agreements that added up to $642,000 that were vaguely detailed or had different product descriptions.Calvert County Public Schools accepted the audit results and said it would address the issues. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nBuses prepare for departure from Easton Elementary after the first day of school in 2022. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That's because money is about values, relationships, choices and self-worth.And while teaching your kids important values to guide their lives is of the utmost importance, when all is said and done those values are more likely to be caught than taught.You have to live what you teach.If there is one thing that will ruin your kids' lives, it's greed. Teach them while they're young how to pull the drain plug on greed, and you will have prepared them in a very important way to not only survive, but to also thrive in the real world.The antidote for greed is giving away part of the three T's - your time, your talent and your treasure. Everyone, no matter how young or poor, possesses all three.Time: You get 24 hours every day, 10,080 minutes or 604,800 seconds every week.Talent: This is what you can do. Everyone has special talents, things they are good at doing.Treasure: This is what you have, your possessions. It's your money, and also your toys, clothes, collections - everything that you own.Are you bewildered? If you have never been a \"giver\" it may seem quite odd for me to suggest you should just give away any of your time or your stuff. But that is exactly what I mean.If you want to make sure you are never defeated by greed, learn to be a giver.When you give to others it helps you to be grateful for what you have. Giving is the way to stop feeling sorry for yourself. Instead of misery, you feel joy. In place of dissatisfaction you find contentment.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Representative from both organizations and the Town of Goldsboro set up by the old railroad station. In less than 2 hours, 110 backpacks filled with supplies like notebooks, rulers, pens and pencils, and other items necessary for successful academic learning, were distributed to children and families.This year the Town of Goldsboro got involved by donating money toward the supplies and providing crafts and activities for kids to do to get them in the back-to-school mindset.\"We wanted to get involved this year because we could see the real need in our community and are always looking for more ways to reach out to our residents and help them with resources,\" said Jeannette DeLude, town manager of Goldsboro.\"The town is so happy that CASA of Caroline and Caroline Pride have brought this event to our town. The North County area is often overlooked, and we, the town and its council, are thrilled that we can help families in need in this part of Caroline County and encourage everyone to also come out for our Fall Fest on Oct. 7 in the same location,\" she said.This is the third year these two agencies have brought school supplies to the northern part of the county.Amy Horne, executive director at CASA of Caroline, said, \"We know that the kids our program serves are involved with multiple systems - the court system, the child welfare system, the health care system, and the school system. As a result, returning to school can be difficult and unpredictable.Our goal is not only to advocate for kids in the courtroom but also in the classroom. By ensuring the children in our community have all the supplies they need to learn and perform in the classroom, we are setting them up for success.\" Having a backpack and school supplies on the first day of school is important for young scholars to feel like they fit in with their peers. Students who feel they fit in at school are more likely to participate in school activities, have friends, perform better academically and have good mental health.\"As a member of a vulnerable population that is targeted by bullies, I know what it's like to feel left out.I don't want any kid in Caroline County to start their school year feeling left out because they didn't have a backpack or any supplies on their first day of school,\" said Angel Perez, CEO of Caroline Pride.Ashley Powell from Greensboro Elementary helped pack the backpacks.Numerous businesses and individuals donated items and money to make the program a success.\"I'm so proud to be a part of this community that gives back to those in need,\" Perez said.\"Yes, it's a community effort, and we're all responsible for keeping our eyes on kids and making sure they have what they need to feel safe, set up for success, and to thrive,\" Horne said. \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nCASA of Caroline and Caroline Pride gave away more than a hundred backpack for a back to school effort in the northern part of Caroline County. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Counties ponder money for college building - Financial commitment worries many of the county officials\n\n September 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: A13 | Section: News \n \n 676\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Talbot and Queen Anne's counties came together virtually Monday to discuss a $79 million project to build a new Technical Center at Chesapeake College.Each county must decide whether or not it wants to submit a letter of intent to the Maryland Higher Education Commission to provide local funds for the facility before a Sept. 28 meeting at the Department of Budget and Management. The meeting, according to Chesapeake College President Cliff Coppersmith, is an opportunity to get the project \"to the next level\" by getting it put on a state list of capital projects.The state has agreed to pay for 75% of the capital project.With these letters of intent, each county would agree to providing local funds for the other 25%. In an email, Coppersmith said that once state funding has been allocated and approved, each supporting county would need to pass appropriations to fund the local share of the capital project.The facility would be more than 90,000 square feet. Of that total, 52,000 square feet would be assignable space. Currently, construction is set for 2026. The center will be located next to the Eastern Shore Higher Education Center.\"Our problem right now is we've got so much equipment crammed in these spaces, there's not a lot of room for students,\" Coppersmith said of the current Queen Anne's Technical Building during the meeting.According to meeting documents from a Queen Anne's County Commissioners meeting Sept. 12, the new facility \"will house programs such as electrical, welding, HVAC, culinary, skilled office/administrative support and marine and construction trades training.\" Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian chaired the meeting between counties Monday evening. Fithian said that while the new facility would be great to have on the Eastern Shore, Kent County does have concerns about the financial aspect of the project.Caroline County Commission Vice President Larry Porter said the cost of building the new facility is what strikes him most.\"I would really like to have a little bit more information about where that number is coming from,\" he said.Coppersmith said the estimated cost includes furnishing the building. He added that the equipment is not a part of that estimate.\"Existing equipment that's useable and still in date, we would just move into the new facility and obviously we would raise money - private funding, public grants, etc.- to upgrade our equipment once we get the building built and we're ready to move in,\" Coppersmith said.Queen Anne's County Commissioner Jack Wilson Jr. acknowledged that the price of the project is a concern, but said he feels confident they will be able to receive more money from the state for the project.Later in the meeting, Wilson said that the Queen Anne's County Commissioners had already voted last week in favor of providing letter of intent.Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said Dorchester County would have to vote against sending a letter of intent at this time. Pfeffer acknowledged that it is a \"great project\" but said that fiscal responsibilities in the county are keeping them from being able to send a letter of intent. Pfeffer said Dorchester County commissioners would be willing to send a letter of support for the project without a binding fiscal commitment.Fithian said each county is going to have to make its decision individually.\"We're all going to have to sit down with our finance office and really see what we can do,\" he said.During the meeting there were talks of possibly submitting a letter, signed by all five counties, detailing the benefits of having this new facility in order to obtain addition funding from the state.Toward the end of the meeting, Talbot County Council member Keasha Haythe said she will be voting in favor of Talbot County submitting a letter of intent.\"As a Chesapeake College alum, I believe it's very necessary and needed,\" she said. \"And considering how the labor force is doing a dive right now, this labor force is needed. We definitely have to be forward thinking to be able to accommodate the future needs of our children and those that are in high school currently.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Commission president: 'I'm on the fence with this' - Breeding balks at Caroline's share of $94M building replacement\n\n September 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: A2 | Section: News \n \n 917\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - With Caroline County's other spending priorities on the front burner, Chesapeake College's $79 million funding request to the five Mid-Shore counties to construct a new technology center was met with hesitation by the Caroline County Commissioners at their Sept. 19 meeting.But the deadline is quickly approaching to make a decision about an over $3.8 million request the county is being asked to fund as its share for a new - and the commissioners agree is necessary - technology building.A virtual meeting was held Sept. 18 between leaders of the college and of the five counties that support the community college in Wye Mills.Earlier in the month, Chesapeake College President Clifford Coppersmith made his case to the Caroline County Commission in Denton.The \"renovation project for the Queen Anne's Technical Center is well past its due date for either a heavy renovation or absolute replacement,\" Coppersmith said on Sept. 5.He asked for \"statements of support or letters of intent from each of (the) support counties.\" Those letters are due before Sept. 28. The project has been submitted to the Maryland State Department of Budget and Management, which will consider it, along with a list of other state projects, on Sept. 28.At their Sept. 19 meeting, the Caroline County Commissioners agreed to draft a letter of intent to support the project, as long as the intention is specifically worded as non-binding.The programs housed in the 2-story, 90,000 square-foot building will include electrical, welding, HVAC, culinary and marine and construction trades training.The state will pay for 75% of the project, with the remaining 25% to be funded by the five counties, and the percentages determined by each county's population. The state's contribution would be just over $59 million.At both the Sept. 5 and Sept. 19 meetings, Commission Vice President Larry Porter supported funding the project, but expressed concern about future unknown costs associated with the 2021 Blueprint for Maryland's Future.Also at the Sept. 5 meeting, Commissioner Frank Bartz supported the project. \"I support this, but Kirwan's going to be the big challenge down the road, but I think our community needs this. I think our young adults need this to offer them more opportunity.\" Kirwan is a nickname for the Blueprint.\"I really do, very seriously, understand the financial impact that this project will have on the region we serve,\" Coppersmith said on Sept. 5.As of Sept. 18, Talbot and Queen Anne's counties agreed to help finance the project. However, Dorchester County declined, and Kent and Caroline had not announced their decisions. A simple majority of counties is needed to approve funding the project.Caroline could join the Queen Anne's County's bond, but the county's interest on the bond over 20 years would increase the final cost to over $6 million.\"And that is on top of the HPAC (Health Professions and Athletics Center) building that we currently pay approximately $110,000 on, so that will put our payment for facilities at $420,000, roughly, until 2034 when the HPAC drops off,\" said Caroline County Finance Director Daniel Fox.Commission President Travis Breeding was not fully convinced at yesterday's meeting. \"This just kind of popped up two weeks ago,\" he said.\"I agree with the consensus of everyone on the call that the building is needed,\" Breeding said. \"But I'm not sure yet how it falls into my priority list. One of my major concerns is and I want to get a few more answers from the college before I vote on it.\" Breeding said he wanted to know \"is how much our local Career and Technology Education Program will be able to utilize the facility during the day.\" \"I am concerned that we have Federalsburg Elementary School, and part of that school was constructed in the 1930s,\" he said. \"We have Lockerman Middle School, Denton Elementary School (and) Ridgely Elementary, all constructed in the 70s as well, and we have a CCTC building at North Caroline High that was constructed in the 1960s. Not to mention, we have a detention center build looming on the horizon, whether we see this regional agreement through.\" \"So, I'm concerned with our ability to take on this much debt,\" Breeding said. \"I don't want to hamstring future boards with a $312,000 payment for the next 20 years, because that will be a line item that they will have no control over, and they will be forced to fund. And I'm concerned about Blueprint. I'm on the fence with this, and I'm going to do a lot more research into next week.\" Porter said he didn't support the HPAC building project, but he supports the new technology center build. \"I think while this opportunity is available, we should utilize it,\" he said. \"If these students are successful in receiving this training and these certifications, they would be able to stay in this county and not have to go somewhere else.\" Porter said he believed, based on Fox's figures, the county \"would be in a position where we would not have to borrow the entire amount.\" \"I'm also cautiously optimistic about the ability of Del. Ghrist to get some Blueprint credit for this,\" Porter said. \"I'm not counting on it, not because I don't think he can't do it - I just don't count on things that are not concrete.\" The commission will make a final decision at its 9 a.m. meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 26, in Room 106, 109 Market St., Denton. \n \n Caption: SCREENSHOT\n \nThe Caroline County Commissioners hosted a presentation by Chesapeake College President Clifford Coppersmith Sept. 5.

    "content": "Tyranny Of The Loud At Washington College\n\n September 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: David Reel | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 709\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With great shock and even greater sadness, I read media accounts of protestors disrupting a recent presentation at Washington College in Chestertown.The presentation featured Dr.Robert George, the McCormick professor of jurisprudence and director of the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions at Princeton University.While Professor George has deeply held conservative beliefs which he does not shy away from expressing, he is also a frequent conversation partner with Cornel West, a progressive professor and political activist. They have appeared together at colleges and universities around the country, arguing for civil dialogue and a broad conception of campus freedom of speech as essential to the truth-seeking mission of academic institutions.Of his longtime friend West has said: \"Robby and I struggle over many issues, but at the deepest human level, it's hard to find anyone with his kind of integrity and genuine concern for others.\"Progressive Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan has said this about Professor George: \"He is one of the nation's most respected legal theorists and the respect he has gained is due to his sheer brilliance, the analytic power of his arguments, the range of his knowledge, a deeply principled conviction and a profound and enduring integrity.\"No stranger to threats of bodily harm, Professor George was once targeted with death threats for views on abortion.So how was Professor George treated during his presentation at Washington College? Extremely poorly is an understatement.The protesters at his presentation did not quietly carry signs and engage in civil dialogue with Professor George following his remarks. Instead, media at the event reported the following: \"The protesters marched in, with campus security allowing them passage.Shouting from the protesters started right away, breaking up the professor's talk.\"The media reported the protesters waved flags, waved signs, blew whistles, played music and danced. They did not stand down until Professor George's presentation ended prematurely, and he [George] was escorted from the room.After this shameful treatment Professor George observed that in all his years visiting numerous colleges and universities including Berkeley, Yale and Harvard (hardly bastions of conservatism), he never had this happen before.After this event, he observed that \"when intimidation works, they'll continue to do it.\"Indeed, they will. Intimidation at this event did work, and there is no reason to believe the protestors will not do it again with anyone who does not embrace their views or asks them to consider other views.That being the case the following questions need to be addressed by the leadership of Washington College.What has been or will be the college's response to the protestors willful disregard for the following Washington College core values?\"We share these values of our founding patron, George Washington: integrity, determination, curiosity, civility, leadership, and moral courage. We develop in our students' habits of analytic thought and clear communication, aesthetic insight, ethical sensitivity and civic responsibility.What has been or will be the college's response to the following comment by one protestor at the event after an email was sent to all students reminding them that it would be a violation of the Student Honor Code to disrupt a speaker?\"Are you going to tell me that WAC (Washington College) can expel every single one of us?Absolutely (expletive) not!\" Why did campus security decide not to intervene with timely and appropriate steps to deal with the protesters well before their disruptive behavior resulted in a premature end of the event?Post event a college spokesperson said, \"The protesters took issue with homophobic and transphobic statements that Professor George has made in the past.\"Is the spokesperson implying that Washington College agrees with the protester's interpretations of and opinions on statements made by Professor George in the past? How committed is Washington College to free speech, civil discourse and ensuring students are exposed to a wide range of views that may challenge how they think and what they think?One can hope that going forward Washington College will walk their talk on their core principles and student honor code to help ensure this recent tyranny of the loud will never happen again. \n \n Caption: WILL BONTRA GER\n \nRobert P.

Altogether, 916 students participated.Elementary students numbered 747 and attended sessions at four elementary schools (Federalsburg was closed for renovations). The average attendance was 14 days of the 19-day program.Participating in the elementary programming were 70 multilingual learners, 49 of whom attend Greensboro Elementary School.In the morning, students participated in both Reading Eggs and Moving with Math or Agile Mind; the Agile Mind math program was introduced for fifth grade students. When the teachers left, students had lunch, and in the afternoon, Recreation and Parks staff led enrichment activities.Secondary students attended only morning sessions. McCormick said one of the goals was to \"boost our middle school program.\"\"We raised our numbers to 40 students, and I was thrilled with that,\" she said. She praised after-school coordinator Deja Thompson for implementing what McCormick envisioned.\"Our middle school students had 45 minutes a day where they could rotate through, by choice, some CTE (Career and Technology Education) mini-sessions,\" McCormick said, adding that \"one of the large pushes\" in the Blueprint For Maryland's Future is more career exploration starting in middle school through high school.McCormick added comments from both teachers and parents to her PowerPoint presentation. One parent noted, \"My seventh grade son didn't want to 'give up' his summer but over the course of five weeks, he only missed three days. He was extremely excited about the CCTC programs he was able to see.\"\"I thought it was just great that our students had the opportunity to be exposed to some of our different CTE programs,\" she said. \"The CTE teachers themselves came to the middle schools to do that.\"Middle school students attended a tri-county, career enrichment day in Dorchester County that McCormick called \"amazing.\"Simmons explained the that Dorchester program is funded by the Mid-Shore Regional Council and is led by People for Change, \"an organization out of Prince George's County of largely minority business owners and professionals who run STEM sessions.\"High school students were offered summer \"credit recovery\" courses, and 131 participated and passed the courses, 92 from North Caroline and 39 from Colonel Richardson.\"It was less students this year, which you could say is a good thing because if you are doing credit recovery, you want less students,\" McCormick said. Students can take credit recovery courses during the school year, as well as repeat courses to earn credits needed for graduation.The program for students with disabilities from elementary through high school increased by 30, with 127 students participating, 102 at the elementary level, and 25 secondary students.CCPS Food Service provided breakfast and lunch for all students, as well as lunch for elementary students, or nearly 15,000 meals. Health rooms were staffed with nurses and health assistants, and School Based Wellness Centers were open.McCormick expects next year's program to be the same duration.\"Nineteen days is amazing.It's not too short, and it's not too long,\" she said.Because some classrooms had waitlists, McCormick said her \"goal is to increase summer programming by 400 students, so I have to have about 1,200 to 1,300 students next summer.\"A 21st Century Grant is pending to help fund the program.This year's program was funded by the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) Fund, food services and in-kind in use of buildings, according to CCPS Communications Officer Sandi Barry.\"We have this funding for one more year, and we want to make sure we maximize it.,\" Simmons said. \"We will continue to look for grant opportunities working with our partners, with Recreation Parks, with the YMCA, if possible.\"\"We will continue working with our partners, but we're going to maximize everything we can to make it make it work, make it sustainable, and then have the great data to then go to the grant sources to keep the funding coming in,\" Simmons said. \n \n Caption: A big bounce house and slippery slide cool off Preston Elementary School students who attend the 19-day summer program.\n \nA little game of checkers is a great way to connect during summer camp at Greensboro Elementary School.\n \nLindsey McCormick, CCPS director of College and Career Readiness, presents results of the Summer School program.\n \nThese two friendly Greensboro Elementary School Hornets are not in a stinging mood during summer camp. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Raskin leads recognition of Banned Books Week\n\n September 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josie Jack; Capital News Service | Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 466\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Mary-land, and Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, introduced a bill Wednesday calling for the national recognition of Banned Books Week, which is Oct. 1-7, and the condemnation of banning books in school libraries.The bill recommends that local governments and schools \"protect the rights of students to learn and the ability of educators and librarians to teach\" and calls for upholding the First Amendment but does not include a unified national protocol for dealing with book bans.\"You know, the proper response to hating a book in a free society is you don't read the book,\" Raskin said at a Capitol Hill press conference Wednesday.The bill, which has 40 co-sponsors in the House and 15 in the Senate, echoes bills the lawmakers introduced in the last session of Congress but neither measure passed.Instances of book banning increased by 33% from the 2021-2022 school year to the 2022-2023 school year, according to the nonprofit PEN America. Books such as \"The Bluest Eye\" by Toni Morrison and \"Gender Queer: A Memoir\" by Maia Kobabe repeatedly have been targeted by critics. Many titles that receive so-called requests for review involve themes of race, sexuality and sexual abuse.Between July 1, 2022, and June 30, there were 3,362 instances of book banning in public libraries and in schools, according to PEN America.Florida accounted for 40% of the book bans. Top states where book bans were instituted were Texas, Utah, Missouri and Pennsylvania.The Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month held a hearing on book bans, where senators and five witnesses discussed balancing the freedom of speech of parents and taxpayers with those of students, teachers and librarians. The hearing examined book ban policies at the state and local level.The debate did not include the introduction of federal policies on book bans nor a tangible, federal solution. Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, asked witnesses Cameron Samuels, a student at Brandeis University and co-founder of Students Engaged in Advancing Texas, and Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias to provide a clear solution; neither did.\"The discussion we've been having for me, it's a little too conceptual, or I don't know, metaphysical,\" Kennedy said.The federal government has not passed legislation to create a unified procedure on book bans. Book ban and review policies and decisions are currently made at the local government level.On June 12, Illinois passed a law that makes libraries that ban books ineligible for state-funded grants. It is the first state in the country to take such action and could pave the way for future federal legislation.\"It's my hope that other states, that others may look toward Illinois and see the value in adopting our legislation as a model to stop banning books in its tracks and to protect the right to read freely without fear of retribution,\" Giannou-lias said at the legislation's signing. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Counties ponder money for college building - Financial commitment worries many of the county officials\n\n October 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 16 | Section: News \n \n 675\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Talbot and Queen Anne's counties came together virtually recently to discuss a $79 million project to build a new Technical Center at Chesapeake College?Each county must decide whether or not it wants to submit a letter of intent to the Maryland Higher Education Commission to provide local funds for the facility before a Sept. 28 meeting at the Department of Budget and Management. The meeting, according to Chesapeake College President Cliff Coppersmith, is an opportunity to get the project \"to the next level\" by getting it put on a state list of capital projects.The state has agreed to pay for 75% of the capital project. With these letters of intent, each county would agree to providing local funds for the other 25%. In an email, Coppersmith said that once state funding has been allocated and approved, each supporting county would need to pass appropriations to fund the local share of the capital project.The facility would be more than 90,000 square feet. Of that total, 52,000 square feet would be assignable space. Currently, construction is set for 2026. The center will be located next to the Eastern Shore Higher Education Center.\"Our problem right now is we've got so much equipment crammed in these spaces, there's not a lot of room for students,\" Coppersmith said of the current Queen Anne's Technical Building during the meeting.According to meeting documents from a Queen Anne's County Commissioners meeting Sept. 12, the new facility \"will house programs such as electrical, welding, HVAC, culinary, skilled office/administrative support and marine and construction trades training.\"Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian chaired the meeting between counties Monday evening. Fithian said that while the new facility would be great to have on the Eastern Shore, Kent County does have concerns about the financial aspect of the project.Caroline County Commission Vice President Larry Porter said the cost of building the new facility is what strikes him most.\"I would really like to have a little bit more information about where that number is coming from,\" he said.Coppersmith said the estimated cost includes furnishing the building. He added that the equipment is not a part of that estimate.\"Existing equipment that's useable and still in date, we would just move into the new facility and obviously we would raise money - private funding, public grants, etc. - to upgrade our equipment once we get the building built and we're ready to move in,\" Coppersmith said.Queen Anne's County Commissioner Jack Wilson Jr. acknowledged that the price of the project is a concern, but said he feels confident they will be able to receive more money from the state for the project.Later in the meeting, Wilson said that the Queen Anne's County Commissioners had already voted last week in favor of providing letter of intent.Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said Dorchester County would have to vote against sending a letter of intent at this time. Pfeffer acknowledged that it is a \"great project\" but said that fiscal responsibilities in the county are keeping them from being able to send a letter of intent. Pfeffer said Dorchester County commissioners would be willing to send a letter of support for the project without a binding fiscal commitment.Fithian said each county is going to have to make its decision individually.\"We're all going to have to sit down with our finance office and really see what we can do,\" he said.During the meeting there were talks of possibly submitting a letter, signed by all five counties, detailing the benefits of having this new facility in order to obtain addition funding from the state.Toward the end of the meeting, Talbot County Council member Keasha Haythe said she will be voting in favor ofTalbot County submitting a letter of intent.\"As a Chesapeake College alum, I believe it's very necessary and needed,\" she said. \"And considering how the labor force is doing a dive right now, this labor force is needed. We definitely have to be forward thinking to be able to accommodate the future needs of our children and those that are in high school currently.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Counties sue social media over mental health in schools - Talbot among 10 counties claiming classroom distraction\n\n October 5, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Christina Walker; Capital News Service | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1088\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A \"boring and pointless\" education.That's what students at Henry E. Lackey High School in Indian Head, in Charles County, tell their English teacher Nicholas Gray they're receiving while they distract themselves with TikTok videos, \"snaps\" on Snapchat and endless scrolls through Instagram during class.\"It is difficult to convince [students] that learning is more impactful and important than the brand new video that will entertain them,\" Gray said.With that thought in mind, Charles County this month joined nine other Maryland school districts in a lawsuit against the world's social media giants: Google, Meta, ByteDance and Snap Inc. Other school districts in the state that have joined the court action are Anne Arundel, Baltimore City, Carroll, Cecil, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George's and Talbot.\"Hopefully this lawsuit provides pressure for some action in terms of how to better create products that are geared to children,\" said Maria Navarro, superintendent of Charles County Public Schools.CLASSROOM DISTRACTIONThe lawsuit accused several social media platforms of targeting and manipulating youth so they stay engaged for excessive amounts of time - and that's exactly what educators see in Charles County classrooms.\"(Social media is) a huge distraction in our schools and in our classrooms,\" said Cheryl Davis, principal of Henry E. Lackey High School.The teachers do their part to plan effective, instructional uses for technology in the classroom, Davis said, but personal devices get in the way.Gray said he prohibits the use of cell phones during instructional times and tries to create engaging lessons so that students will not be tempted to use their devices or go on social media.However, he said, the biggest problem plaguing his students is self control and their failure to regulate personal behavior.\"Students are lacking the ability to express their emotions in a positive way,\" Davis said. \"We see a lot more negative expressions.\"Students have gotten more angry and aggressive, Davis said. In a developmental part of their lives, they often fail to pause for a moment and look for resources or constructive ways to express their emotions.\"There is no respite,\" Gray said. \"Students leave for the day and the talking/anger continues onto Instagram or Snapchat, and then the students come to school upset over what is on social media.\"Several Charles County educators said more physical altercations have occurred because of social media conflicts.\"Snapchat scares me,\" said Brian Street, a father of two Piccowaxen middle schoolers.\"I've seen several fights at school on Snapchat.\"On top of that, two staff members at St. Charles High School were injured Thursday after they intervened in a physical altercation between students that started over a social media post, according to a letter that Principal Tammika Little sent out to parents.\"Please monitor your child's electronic devices and social media accounts,\" Little said.MENTAL HEALTHNot surprisingly, school officials in Charles County and elsewhere are alarmed at how social media affects child development and mental health. That concern is also reflected in the lawsuit, which alleges that companies are aware of the negative impacts the platforms have on children's mental health, but they choose to prioritize profit.Students go through developmental changes from elementary school to middle school, where their focus shifts from their parents to their peer group. Navarro said this is when children start pushing their own boundaries and understanding how to become an adult.As students become more self-sufficient, they begin building confidence - but social media usage during this stage can interrupt a child's growth, Navarro said.\"A fake reality, at those pivotal developmental ages, has more of an impact on behavioral health,\" Navarro said. \"It also isolates you.\"Navarro said social media augments the insecurities children face at pivotal ages, and research seems to prove that point. Researchers at Facebook found that Instagram, in 2021, made one in three girls feel worse about their bodies, according to the Wall Street Journal.Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic further isolated children and left many in a more fragile mental state.According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2021, suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 14.Charles County educators said social media contributes to the mental health crises that some young people endure. Inappropriate social media interactions continue to create disruptions in the buildings all over the county because children these ages are not developmentally ready for the responsibility, Davis said.\"Students lack the maturity to be able to handle social media,\" Davis said.That being the case, Davis said schools must make mental health a priority or else their true purpose will not be achieved.\"We are here to educate students,\" Davis said. \"If students are not in the right mindset, then it's much more difficult for them to access education.\"Searching for solutions While voicing support for the lawsuit, Charles County educators are looking elsewhere for more prompt solutions to the problems social media causes in the classroom.Davis pushed for parents to be a part of the solution.\"You pay for the phone, you own the phone, put some apps on there that allow you to control access,\" Davis said.Parents should be monitoring their kids' devices to make sure they're safe, Davis said, and it is not just her who feels this way.\"It's not a school thing, it's a parent thing,\" Street said.He said that while he does monitor his kids' social media usage, it is a parents' decision on how active they want to be in controlling it.Navarro said Charles County Public Schools has many resources for parents to learn how to be tech savvy so they know how to keep their children safe. In addition to limiting screen time, she said parents should be encouraging kids to physically play, talk and participate in sports and extracurricular activities with other kids.Navarro said when to allow children to have devices is a parent's choice.\"My job is to inform and educate them about the implications of those decisions,\" Navarro said. She said she wants students to reach their full potential, but right now social media makes it harder for them to do that.That's where the lawsuit could help.Navarro said that if the district gets any compensation from this lawsuit, the school system intends to expand resources for the growing needs of behavioral health.And even in these early stages, Navarro said, the lawsuit serves an important purpose.\"It sends a message,\" she said.The message: that everyone - from social media companies to educators to parents to students - must be alert to the harm that social media can do to young people. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Level one is a \"beginning learner,\" level two is a \"developing learner,\" and level four is a \"distinguished learner.\"Students who fall into levels 3 and 4 are considered proficient in the subject. In Dorchester County, the percent of students that fall into level 4 for the English language arts and math categories are between 0 and 5%.For the level three proficient learner category in English language arts, compared to Spring 2022 data:\u25aa Third graders increased to 31% from 26.4%.\u25aa Fourth graders increased to 32% from 27.6%.\u25aa Fifth graders increased to 33% from 26.8%\u25aa Sixth graders increased to 33% from 22.2% - a 10.8% increase.\u25aa Seventh graders decreased to 20% from 24.1%.\u25aa Eighth graders decreased to 27% from 29.2%.Along with seventh and eighth graders, there was a drop in the percent of proficient learners for the English 10 assessment compared to the previous year. The percentage dropped from 36.4% to 35%.Colman said the state average growth for English language arts was 2.9 percentage points.Dorchester County's average growth was 4.1 percentage points, she said.\"So we grew significantly, or doubled, the amount that the rest of the state did,\" she said. \"It put us at the eleventh spot [in the state] as far as growth is concerned.\"Laura Aberg, DCPS supervisor of reading and English language arts for K through 12, spoke after Colman presented on the English language arts data.\"I'm excited to see all the growth for our younger students,\" she said.\"Our secondary students, we need to do some work to get back to the levels of growth that we like to see.\"Aberg said the district has implemented more diagnostics at the beginning of the year to identify those \"reading gaps\" so they can be addressed sooner for secondary students. She also talked about getting ready to enroll students in grades six through eight, as well as tenth graders, in MCAP tutorials.Aberg said she hopes to see even greater growth for younger students in the future since the district has implemented a foundational reading program that aligns with the science of reading, or the research behind how students learn to read.Board Member Theresa Stafford asked Aberg what the district did differently last year that might be attributed to the growth in proficiency for elementary students.Aberg mentioned multiple changes including the use of DIBELS test data to \"help drive instruction\" and getting teachers trained in the science of reading.MATHWhen it came to MCAP math assessments, grade seven and Algebra I saw significant increases in proficiency. The percentage of seventh graders that were considered proficient learners increased to 11% from less than 5% the year before. The percentage of Algebra I students that were considered proficient learners increased to 10% from less than 5% the year before.For grade six, there was a decrease in proficient learners, compared the year before, from 10% to less than 5%.For the other math assessments in the county, there was a mix of slight increases, slight decreases and constants in the percentage of proficient learners compared to the previous year. These include:\u25aa Third graders decreased to 20% from 20.3%\u25aa Fourth graders increased to 15% from 14.6%\u25aa Fifth graders increased to 14% from 12.2%\u25aa Eighth graders stayed at less than 5%\u25aa Geometry students stayed at 0%\u25aa Algebra II students decreased to 0% from less than 5%Colman said that while the state average growth for math was 2.5 percentage points, Dorchester County grew 2.0 percentage points.DCPS is focusing on improving math scores for third graders, sixth graders and Algebra I students this year, she said.\"Those were kind of the focus areas as far as the data,\" Colman said.She said there is a focus on third grade because it is the first group of students to take the MCAP assessments and there is a need for those students to gain a better understanding of the assessment.At the middle school level, Colman said the math coach is working with teachers and modeling lessons. The math coach is also working and planning with Algebra I teachers.\"So she's kind of targeted certain grade levels to try to impact some of this data,\" Colman said.After Colman's presentation on the math data, Board Member Chris Wheedleton talked about the importance of recognizing the data, good and bad, and talking about how the data can be improved for next year.\"I'm really pleased to see what you all are doing with this, how you've organized it,\" he said. \"But then, it's really about the action.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Carey Wright appointed interim state superintendent\n\n October 6, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 540\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Maryland State Board of Education voted unanimously on Wednesday evening to appoint Carey Wright as the interim State Superintendent of Schools for the remainder of the current term through June 30, 2024. Wright will begin her service as state superintendent by Oct. 23, 2023, pending the completion of onboarding logistics.Most recently, Wright served for nine years as the state superintendent of schools in Mississippi.\"I am honored to be appointed to this position and am excited to work on behalf of the teachers, leaders and students of Maryland. Maryland is well-positioned to provide a world-class education system for all its students and to ensure each student's success,\" Wright said. \"I am confident that by establishing strong relationships and partnerships across the state we will witness strong, equitable educational outcomes for our students. I welcome the opportunity to be an active participant in this endeavor.\"Under Wright's leadership, Mississippi's Quality Counts grade for education improved from an F to a C, improving its ranking from 50th to 35th. Her work reform efforts to improve literacy instruction for children Pre-K through third grade produced significant improvements in literacy rates in Mississippi, with the largest gains in fourth grade literacy on the National Assessment for Educational Progress.\"I am thrilled to welcome Dr. Carey Wright as Maryland's Interim State Superintendent. She is an exceptional leader who will guide Maryland's education system into its new chapter,\" Gov. Wes Moore said. \"Dr. Wright brings exemplary expertise to this role and I am confident that she will be a dedicated leader committed to transparency, accountability, and partnership to improve education outcomes in every corner of Maryland, just as this state deserves.\"Wright has long been an enthusiastic advocate for early childhood education and in Mississippi implemented the first publicly funded Early Learning Collaborative program, which earned the state recognition from the National Institute for Early Education Research as one of only seven states in the nation that meet all or most quality standards for early childhood education.Wright brings to the position decades of service as a Maryland educator with stints in Prince George's, Howard, and Montgomery County Public Schools as a teacher, principal, director of special education, and associate superintendent. Prior to serving as superintendent in Mississippi, Wright served as the chief academic officer in DC Public Schools. Wright obtained her bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park.\"Dr. Wright is a Maryland educator and a national leader of education reform. She has the experience and expertise to lead Maryland through implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and through our state's commitment to educational equity and improving outcomes for all students,\" State Board President Clarence Crawford said. \"We are confident in her ability to lead our school system through this transition period, to be focused on transparency and accountability, and to continue building towards the improvements in results in our schools that we all know are necessary.\"Wright will receive a salary at an annual rate of $350,000, which will be prorated to the amount of time she serves from now through June 30, 2024. The joint State Board and MSDE Transition Team will support Wright as she is onboarded, and the national search for a permanent state superintendent of schools will continue in the coming months. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'My purpose was fulfilled' - Caregiver awarded scholarship\n\n October 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 511\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WORTON - When Casey Hart walked into a Wilmington hospital three years ago, she told medical staff that she was going to die. All of a sudden, this professional caregiver was on the other side of needing care.Hart, a resident of Worton, had developed sepsis after a surgery in 2020, and needed around the clock care in her recovery. \"If it wasn't for my two aunts,\" Hart stated, \"I wouldn't be here right now.\" Hart's aunts went to work, re-arranging the home to make it more accommodating for Hart's care. \"They bathed me, brushed my teeth and hair,\" said Hart. \"I owe them the world.\" This traumatizing experience gave Hart a better insight into what her clients go through, how vulnerable they are.Hart, a Worton resident, works for Griswold Home Care, a business founded over 40 years ago by Dr. Jean Griswold in suburban Philadelphia. Some of Hart's clients are simply looking for companionship while others require more involved personal care services.Hart was recently awarded $3,000 in scholarship funds after winning the company's 2023 National Caregiver Scholarship Program, in partnership with its nonprofit organization, the Jean Griswold Foundation. She plans on using it as she pursues a RN nursing degree.The Griswold National Caregiver Scholarship Program is intended to offer financial support to family caregivers, professional caregivers, and those interested in pursuing a career in the care industry. Hart was nominated for the scholarship for being an exceptional caregiver in the Worton area of Kent County. Hart feels lucky to be a part of the Griswold Home Care family.\"Their support has pushed me toward success. I wouldn't trade what I was doing for anything in this world.\" Hart began caregiving at an early age, taking care of her niece who had special needs. Though she tried working in retail, her heart just wasn't in it. When she began delivering professional care to clients, she knew this would become her life's work.\"My purpose was fulfilled,\" said Hart.Part of the joy she finds from her work is getting to know the stories of her grateful clients.\"The veterans share details of coming home from war,\" she said. Another memorable client was a woman who was paralyzed when a drunk driver hit her on the night of her senior prom.\"She had every right to be angry, but she was just happy that she was saved,\" Hart said. \"I believe that there is always something to learn from everyone I serve.\" \"Our founder Jean Griswold believed in lifelong education and the importance of providing growth opportunities for our care professionals. Post-pandemic, the crucial role played by caregivers became obvious, and the Jean Griswold Foundation Board of Directors felt strongly about refocusing its mission to support them financially through scholarships,\" said Michael Slupecki, CEO of Griswold, and Jean Griswold Foundation Board member.\"Money is often the only thing standing between a motivated caregiver and a degree or certification.If we can help elevate the care profession through education, it benefits not only Griswold, but everyone across the country. Because if you haven't yet needed the support of a caregiver, you absolutely will someday.\" \n \n Caption: CASEY HART \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Kent County News had the opportunity to ask her questions as well.Dowell was hired in early 2021, when the Kent County Library, like everything else across the country, was trying to adapt to the new norm of living with Covid.Q: What has been your biggest challenge as Executive Director?A: \"I got acclimated to everything very quickly,\" said Dowell. \"I oversaw the return of the senior team, putting library staff in place, and finally opening the branches back up.\" Dowell thanks the community for their support and was pleased that the library has since increased its growth.\"We've definitely seen an increase in library patrons, with over half the residents now owning a library card,\" she said.As the world began to get back to the new normal, Dowell and her team shifted focus to upgrading technology and making more of it available to county residents. Today, she and the library's board of directors are now working on improving their current program offerings; developing solutions to the issues raised by patrons in a recent survey; and focusing on how the library is identified in the community today.Q: What are you focusing on currently?A: \"I want residents to feel we are inclusive,\" said Dowell, \"like our libraries are really for everyone.\" New programming, a new website, and more technology for increased access to information for residents are planned for 2024. There are also ongoing discussions about future plans for the Rock Hall branch location.Q: Why did you become a librarian and why did you come to Kent County?A: Dowell says she was born in Mississippi, but grew up in Germany with her military family.Most of Dowell's extended family lived in Maryland, and she moved back and started working at Goucher's and then Towson's libraries. When her mother became ill, it was her librarian friends that got her through it. \"They were wonderful and really made me want to work in that profession,\" said Dowell.Her commitment to increasing the opportunities for residents of a rural area is why she took the Executive Director position in Kent County. She cited examples that have been put in place to support that goal, like the Kent County free laptop program and expanding the e-library offerings.Q: What has been your greatest success so far at Kent County Library?A: Dowell was very excited about the results of this year's summer reading program. Over the course of nine weeks, registered summer readers embraced the \"All Together Now\" theme at 75 summer library events.\"Last summer, readers logged over 700,000 minutes, so this summer we set our sights even higher at 850,000 minutes,\" said Dowell. \"The final count for this summer was over 900,000 minutes read!\" Q: What is coming up in the fall for Kent County Library?A: Dowell said all county libraries of Maryland have partnered with Maryland Humanities in the \"One Maryland One Book\" program that aims to bring communities together through the shared experience of reading, discussing, and exploring the themes in a single book. This fall's chosen features author Tommy Orange's work \"There There.\" Released in 2018, the book tells the stories of twelve Native Americans as they converge toward the Big Oakland Powwow. Critics have called it \"a riveting portrait of the urban Indian experience.\" I'm excited to share that the Kent County Library will hold a special presentation with Chief Donna Wolf Mother Abbott, the first Female Chief of the Nause-Waiwash Band of Indians,\" said Dowell, \"She will be speaking about the past, present, and future of the Nause-Waiwash on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\" Q: What is your feeling about the movement to ban books in other areas of the country?A: \"I am just shocked,\" said Dowell. In fact, Kent County Library will be participating in the American Libraries Association's Banned Books Week this fall. \"We will celebrate some of the books that have been challenged that are still on our shelves. Books help people learn and open a door to creativity,\" Dowell said. \"I believe that everybody deserves a voice, and I feel like representation matters.\" Q: What is your favorite book?A: Dowell said the answer was a simple one-\"Oh, the Places You'll Go\" by Dr. Seuss. \"It's really the theme of a library's purpose,\" said Dowell. \"A really good book or technology at your fingertips can take you anywhere in the world.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nArnessa Dowell, executive director of Kent County Library, visited all branches last week to provide information for and to get input from library patrons. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Open to students across the Shore, including Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot, working individually or in groups, Junior Division (grades six-eight) and Senior Division (grades nine-12) students select a topic related to an annual theme. Information on the competitive event is distributed to students by their history teachers.The 2024 NHD theme is \"Turning Points in History.\" There are five different types of projects that students complete: documentaries, exhibits, performances, and websites that can be done as a group or individually or papers that may only be done individually.Research is key, so the two teachers partnered with the public libraries in the participating Upper Shore counties of Queen Anne's, Kent, Talbot, and Cecil.\"Schools have limited research options,\" said Hayman, \"so we turned to the county libraries who have more resources.\" During the fall season, as students begin picking a theme and looking for information, the teachers make themselves available at libraries across the region on specific dates so that librarians and History Day staff can provide assistance with finding research options, accessing online databases, or browsing materials.Hayman said the students learn valuable skills \"like how to analyze information, to make sure sources are reliable, and to form their own opinion.\" Last weekend, Hayman and Anders visited Queen Anne's Library on Kent Island. Next up is the Talbot County Free Library in Easton on Oct. 21 from 9 a.m. 1 p.m.; Queen Anne's County Library in Centreville from 9 a.m. 1 p.m. on Nov. 4; and the Learning Resource Center at Chesapeake College on Nov. 12 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.The actual contest is March 23, 2024, at Chesapeake College. Judges from the Upper-Shore community include teachers, professors, and museum staff. Students who place are then able to participate in the state finals on May 4 at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.The hard work of Hayman and Anders has paid off. \"We saw that at the beginning the winners were always from the western shore,\" said Anders.\"Now we send more students to the state event than everyone but Baltimore County.\" Hayman said the program helps make history more real and interesting to students.\"You don't usually have students thrilled to be in history class,\" said Hayman. \"Students who participate sometimes find their true passion.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nThomas Hayman and Andy Anders, both history teachers at Centreville Middle School, visit Queen Anne's County Library Kent Island branch on their first stop helping students from the Upper Shore with their History Day project research. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Washington College receives $54.7 Million from Hodson Trust - Guarantees $30k+ scholarships for students with a 3.3+ GPA\n\n October 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 10 | Section: News \n \n 492\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN - Washington College announced the largest gift in the College's 240-year history: a $54.7 million gift from The Hodson Trust to provide financial support for students. The Hodson gift will grow the College's scholarship endowment to approximately $170 million and its overall endowment to $325 million, strengthening the College's ability to make a college education more affordable to students from all backgrounds.\"This generous gift from The Hodson Trust is truly transformative for Washington College,\" said President Mike Sosulski. \"Access to an outstanding educational experience is a pressing issue for many families today. The Trust's support of our students' financial needs expands our ability to ensure access to a wide range of potential students, particularly those who are first-generation or come from underserved communities.\" As a result of the Hodson gift, Washington College will guarantee a minimum scholarship of $30,000 per year ($120,000 over four years) to any incoming student with at least a 3.3 grade point average who applies by Dec. 1. Students may qualify for more aid based on their academic performance. The Hodson Trust Washington Scholars endowment, which provides full tuition, fees and the cost of room and board for students with significant financial need, will also benefit from this gift.\"We are excited to be able to offer this scholarship opportunity to deserving students,\" said Vice President for Enrollment Johnnie Johnson. \"It will allow us to continue to grow the diversity of our campus community and enhance the intellectual environment of the College. These scholarship funds will help us recruit more of the best and brightest students to Washington College from Maryland, the mid-Atlantic region, and beyond.\" Support for financial aid opens new opportunities for students and their families who think an education at a private college is out of reach.Because private colleges like Washington provide significant student financial aid when compared to public universities, the cost of a private education becomes more affordable. For the current academic year, Washington College provided $40.6 million in total financial aid with the average student aid totaling $45,745, compared to the University of Maryland, whose published average student aid is $9,074.The gift is part of the dissolution of The Hodson Trust. Established in 1920 by Colonel Clarence Hodson, the Trust has been a longtime supporter of Washington College and its largest benefactor, having now donated more than $150 million to the College since 1935.For almost 90 years, The Hodson Trust has contributed to Washington College in a number of ways, including establishing or contributing to endowments that support student scholarships; undergraduate research and internship stipends; faculty chairs, salary enhancement, and professional development funds; and the College's signature academic centers. In addition, The Hodson Trust contributed to the construction of Hodson Hall, Hodson Boathouse, the John Toll Science Center, and the Lelia Hynson Boating Park.The Hodson family has a long and illustrious legacy at Washington College.Colonel Hodson, his daughter, Lelia Hodson Hynson, and granddaughter, Sally Hynson Hopkins, served on the Washington College Board of Visitors and Governors. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chapel District Elementary renovation design plans move to state for review\n\n October 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 568\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - The Talbot County Board of Education approved the design development submission for the Chapel District Elementary School renovation and addition at a Board of Education meeting Wednesday evening.The design development plan needs to be submitted to the state for review by Nov. 1. TCPS Director of Operations Kevin Shafer said this submission is the next milestone in the design process.Before the board voted unanimously to submit the design development plan, Shafer and Adam McDonald, project manager and architect from design firm Hord Coplan Macht, gave a presentation to update the board on plans for the project, including the schedule and estimated project costs.McDonald explained that the project includes a full renovation of the existing building and 16,600 square feet of additions.Three total additions at different corners of the building will add additional learning space.\"The additions are also going to help us enhance the overall design of the building,\" McDonald said.Since the board's last update on project plans, McDonald said they have made changes to the addition on the north corner of the building to \"work better with the existing utilities\" during construction.A traffic pattern has been formalized, and a first submission has been made to the State Highway Administration to create an additional curb cut to separate the parent entry loop from the bus drop.\"To help alleviate some of the traffic concerns that come with a shared entrance,\" McDonald said.The design plans for outside also include an extension to the parking lot to provide more space for parents dropping off students.Inside the building, McDonald said that most spaces will remain in the same areas as they are pre-renovation.The main change, he said, is that the media center will move to the front of the building and the art classroom will take over where the current media center is.Currently, bidding for the project is expected to take place in April and May of 2024. Construction would begin in June of 2024 and is estimated to take about two years.The estimated cost of construction and site work is $25.18 million. State and county funding for this will come out of FY2025 and FY2026 budgets. With additional expenditures, for things like design costs, the project is expected to cost $29.97 million.Shafer said this estimated cost is $1 million less than the state projection for the project.\"So I feel like we're within where we want to be,\" he said, adding that this is still just a projection and the real numbers will come when they bid the project out.After the presentation, board members asked questions.Board Member Deborah Bridges asked about the plan for the school's roof.\"The slanted roofs really have me worried,\" she said, expressing concern about drainage.Shafer said the pitched roof is not near the courtyard.\"The architect will make sure that any kind of drainage that's coming off the roof, whether it's roof drain or exterior drain, is properly sized to accommodate that water shed,\" he said. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nAdam McDonald, project manager and architect from design firm Hord Coplan Macht, updates the Talbot County Board of Education on design plans for the Chapel District Elementary School renovation and addition project at a Board of Education meeting Oct. 18.\n \nCOURTESY OF TALBOT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS\n \nA rendering of what the front of Chapel District Elementary School would look like based on renovation and addition project plans. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "It's in the family - Anna Howie speaks on joining Board of Education\n\n October 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 551\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Education is in Anna Howie's blood.Specifically, Talbot County education is in Anna Howie's blood.Her grandfather and mother taught in the district.Her mother was even her sixth grade language arts teacher at Easton Middle School.When Howie, the newest member of the Talbot County Board of Education, went to college, she wanted to be an engineer.However, a career in education just kept chasing her.In college, she became involved with something called 'The Algebra Project,' where she taught students algebra concepts.For a college internship, she worked with students at a middle school.At a college ministry meeting, Howie remembers the speaker saying, \"someone in here, you're an engineering student.And you know God told you you're supposed to be a teacher.'\" Although she graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in engineering, she unsurprisingly found teaching eventually. Her first job in education was teaching at a middle school.Now, Howie is the curriculum supervisor of career and technical education for Dorchester County Public Schools as well as the interim principal at Mace's Lane Middle School.Monday, she was sworn in to the Board of Education after being appointed to the District 5 seat by Gov. Wes Moore. The appointment comes after the resignation of Susan Delean-Botkin, the previous District 5 board member.W hen she learned of the appointment, Howie told her husband first. He was so excited he switched a flight he had for a conference so he could watch her get sworn in on Monday.Howie herself was excited and honored.\"A little scared at the same time, because this is a huge undertaking and it's extremely important,\" she said.Howie talked about the importance of being able to support students' social and emotional and mental health, especially after COVID-19.\"Schools are safe places for a lot of our students,\" she said. \"If I'm hungry, if I'm angry, if I don't know where I'm going to go to sleep tonight, I can't learn.\" Social and emotional learning is one of the Board's priorities this school year. Its other priorities are increasing academic achievement and teacher retention.\"There are teacher shortages everywhere right now, and it's so important that we retain the teachers,\" she said.\"Because when you have to continually hire new teachers, there is that onboarding process and there is that learning curve.\" Joining the board, Howie is continuing her mother and grandfather's legacy in Talbot County Public Schools.When Howie was 18, her mother died from breast cancer. She remembers the funeral being \"packed\" with former students and teachers from the district.\"There are teachers in this school district that knew my mom when she was here and they come up to me all the time and they're like, 'Your mother would be so proud,'\" Howie said, tearing up.With two meetings under her belt so far - a work session on Monday and a regular meeting on Wednesday - Howie is feeling welcomed by her fellow board members.She appreciates the organization of the meetings.\"Everything went very smooth,\" she said.Although she's been on the board for less than a week, Howie has already been thinking about whether she will run for the position when her seat is up next year. She doesn't have an answer yet, though.\"I have definitely, definitely put a lot of thought into that,\" she said. \"This is such a wonderful opportunity.\" \n \n Caption: ANNA HOWIE \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There are still spots open for William Messner's lecture on the \"Rise and Fall of the Talbot Boys Memorial\" and for \"Integrity and Effective Leadership\" at the USNA.Join Messner on Tuesday, Nov. 14, from 1 to 2:20 p.m. as he lays out the factors that prompted the Talbot Boy's statue's removal last year.As he explains, the pre-WW I period marked the zenith of racism in the nation. Especially in the South, this period saw the institutionalization of segregation and the utilization of extra-legal means, such as lynching, to insure the maintenance of the racial order.Not coincidentally, throughout the South, memorials to the Confederate lost cause appeared, often in the form of statues of Rebel soldiers. Talbot County was not immune to this pattern of activity, as a memorial to those county residents who fought for the Confederacy - the Talbot Boys - was constructed on the Courthouse lawn in Easton.A century later the statue, one of the last in the South still standing on public grounds, was dismantled, the result of a decade of agitation on the part of Black residents and their allies who demanded the erasure of all vestiges of the old racial order.The event will be hybrid, in person at Easton Family YMCA or via ZOOM.It is $20 to reserve a spot. To register, visit https://chesapeakeforum.org.On Wednesday, Nov. 15, travel to the US Naval Academy for a lecture on how ethics and moral reasoning guide behavior, while integrity defines how individuals conduct their daily lives.Taking from both classical and contemporary thought in moral philosophy, Jeff Macris, Ph.D., the deputy director of the Stockdale Institute, will show how the USNA seeks to provide its future Naval officers with the ability to understand the moral complexities of leadership.\"Integrity and Effective Leadership\" is a field trip to the USNA by carpool or private vehicle from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. It costs $20 to participate.To register, visit https://chesapeakeforum.org. \n \n Caption: JEFF MACRIS\n \nBILL MESSNER \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She started working in 2021 at McDonald's in Denton, \"where she strived to build relationships with people from different backgrounds and experiences,\" according to an Oct. 11 press release.She is studying veterinary medicine with the goal of becoming a veterinarian.Recipients were selected based on their demonstrated leadership, participation in local community activities, work experience, experience in overcoming challenges, and who and what has inspired them.\"Often, we are the first job for many of our high school employees, said Michael A. Meoli, owner and operator of The Meoli Family McDonald's Restaurants.\"Nothing pleases us more than to see them go on to future success and to support that journey.\" With its scholarship program, Meoli Companies supports \"hardworking employees who are headed to college,\" according to the press release.Headquartered in Rehoboth Beach, Meoli Companies owns and operates 25 McDonald's restaurants across the Delmarva Peninsula.The other scholarship recipients included Jonathan Brittingham of Selbyville, Delaware, who is attending the University of Delaware in Newark, Delaware; Henry Grote of Selbyville, Delaware, who attending Liberty University in Lynchburg Virginia; Monique Payne of Dover, Delaware, who is attending Delaware State University in Dover; and McKenzie Tubbs of Millsboro, Delaware, who is attending the University of Delaware.The scholarship application asked students questions which focused on the employee's overall story, their presence in the community, challenges they have overcome and plans for their education.\"While we respect the importance of a student's GPA as a demonstration of their commitment to learning, we consider many more attributes to ensure we have a well-rounded picture of the individuals we consider for a scholarship,\" Meoli said.\"The response was overwhelming and speaks to the incredible stories these graduates have to share,\" he said. \"For nearly 30 years, we've been committed to delivering a gold standard experience for our McDonald's customers each and every time they visit our restaurants, and that starts by hiring outstanding people.\" \"It's not just about the food we serve or the restaurants we serve it in. It's about the communities in which our restaurants operate. Each of our communities is unique and we strive to find ways we can make the greatest impact in every one of them,\" Meoli said. \n \n Caption: FAITH JOHNSON \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Black and Hispanic faculty underrepresented in universities\n\n November 2, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Nira Dayanim; Capital News Service | Page: 11 | Section: News \n \n 816\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Black and Hispanic communities are underrepresented among university faculty at Maryland's six largest public universities, according to the 2021 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).This analysis does not include Maryland's online universities or historically black colleges and universities.IPEDS is an annual data collection system run through the U.S. Department of Education.These findings align with trends across the country, data shows.The U.S. Census projects that 32% of Maryland's population are Black and 12% are Hispanic.At Maryland's six largest in-person public universities, not including HBCUs - University of Maryland, Baltimore County; University of Maryland, College Park; Towson University; Frostburg State University; Salisbury University and St. Mary's College of Maryland-less than 6% of the total faculty are Black and less than 5% are Hispanic, as of 2021.According to Laura Perna, Vice Provost for Faculty at University of Pennsylvania and a researcher on college access, faculty underrepresentation is a widespread issue, though the specifics differ by university.Across Maryland, faculty demographics vary widely. At Towson University, 7% of faculty were Black in fall 2021 and 3% were Hispanic. At Frostburg State University, those numbers were about halved, with 4% Black faculty and almost 1% Hispanic faculty.Prior to 2022, Maryland's education code allowed individual public universities to implement their own plans for \"cultural diversity,\" which ranged in length and breadth. In 2022, a new code was instituted, requiring public universities to ensure that faculty, staff, and administration demographics reflect the state's diverse population.Between 2016 and 2021, the percentages of Black and Hispanic faculty at the universities included in the analysis both increased by just under a percentage point.\"It really is amazing how little progress there has been in some ways on this,\" said Perna.According to Dr. Kimberly Griffin, Dean of University of Maryland's College of Education, many people assume that faculty will diversify alongside the student body. This \"trickle up\" system is unrealistic, she says.The problem is multifaceted, says Griffin. Academia is tasked with generating a pool, hiring inclusively, yielding candidates, onboarding hirees, retaining them, and ultimately, promoting them. \"We have to do more in all of those spaces,\" says Griffin, whose research has focused on issues of diversity, equity and inclusion in post-secondary education.According to Perna, one roadblock is \"invisible labor\" faculty of color often take on work that requires time and energy, but does not fit academia's standard promotion metrics.\"We should be looking at to what extent our definition of merit is very narrow,\" said Perna.Underrepresented minorities often spend more time serving on committees and mentoring students of color, labor that often goes unrecognized, says Perna. Come time for promotions, publications and course evaluations are weighted more heavily.As the student body has diversified, the gap between representation among students and faculty has widened, straining faculty of color.As of fall 2021, Black students made up 17% and Hispanic students made up 8% of the student body at the universities included in the CNS analysis. That was an increase of 10% and 19% since 2016, respectively.Faculty demographics remained stable.In 2021, the resulting ratio of Black students to Black faculty members was 60:1. The ratio of white students to white faculty members was 15:1.According to Griffin, while it's crucial for students of color to have role models and mentors of color, there isn't enough faculty of color to shoulder that responsibility alone.\"That's a load everyone should share,\" she said.A lack of diversity also impacts faculty of color pursuing tenure. At Maryland's six largest in-person public universities, not including HBCUs, in 2021, 71% of tenured professors were white, 5% Black, and 4% were Hispanic, according to IPEDS.A lack of diversity among tenured faculty can make it harder for some faculty of color to find mentors as they pursue tenure, though many members of academia, like Griffin, are trying to combat this by developing intentional mentoring policy.\"Mentorship that helps you build a sense of connection and community in your unit and in your college is also really important for helping folks get to tenure,\" said Griffin.Katharina Maisel, a bioengineering professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, co-authored a list of best practices for increasing diversity alongside several other faculty members in the STEM field.According to Maisel, diversifying the faculty, especially tenure and tenure track, takes intention at every stage of the process, from inviting people to apply, inviting people for internships, and checking your shortlist to make sure you're not just inviting people from Ivy League schools.But it's possible.In science, technology, engineering and math, says Maisel, a tendency to be overspecific in job listings can discourage faculty from underrepresented backgrounds.Using rubrics to evaluate a candidate for hiring or promotion can help ensure an objective set of criteria, helping reel in internal biases, Maisel said.\"If you as a department are really actively interested in increasing the diversity of your faculty, there are things you can do,\" Maisel said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Sessions were offered for a myriad of STEM related topics, including 3D printing and the makerverse, Python coding, and lego robotics GeoCaching, a CDL simulator, a tour of the Health Professions laboratory and an Art and Sciences tour were also offered. The event has seen steady growth since its inception in 2017.Part of the Maryland STEM Festival 2023, sponsored by University of Maryland Extension, 4-H, and Family & Consumer Sciences, Navonne Owen, UME/4-H educator for Caroline County, heads up the event, along with a crew of dedicated educators from the Mid-Shore and the college.Owen estimates this year's attendance topped approximately 250 students and adults. She was happy to say, \"Many of the attendees come year after year, especially the younger folks who have an interest in STEM related topics.\" \"We hope to offer topics here to augment what students are exposed to in school, or topics which might ignite an interest - maybe prompting students to go out and discover more about a topic on their own,\" she said.When asked about the role Chesapeake College was playing in the event, Owen was quick to say \"Chesapeake College has really grown a lot in recent years. It's a hidden diamond here on the Shore - a resource which is sometimes overlooked. There are so many options here now for local students, with cost effective options for completing various fields of study.\" Maryland 4-H has long been a champion of STEM education, offering comprehensive support to engage young people in these critical fields.The program's commitment to fostering STEM skills and interests is evident in a variety of initiatives and activities designed to inspire curiosity, innovation and lifelong learning.To this extent, 4-H offers a wealth of STEM-focused clubs and projects, providing youth with opportunities to explore their interests in subjects like robotics, computer programming, environmental science and more.These clubs allow for hands-on, experiential learning that goes beyond the classroom.4-H hosts STEM camps and workshops that immerse young participants in the world of STEM through engaging and interactive activities.These programs not only educate but also excite and encouraging youth to pursue further studies and careers in STEM.With the help of educators like Owen, 4-H organizes and supports various STEM competitions and events, such as science fairs, robotics challenges, and engineering contests. These competitions promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork.For more information on similar events or for the 2024 STEM Festival, contact the University of Maryland Extension for Caroline County 4-H Office at 410-479-4030 or by emailing Navonne Owen at nowen@umd.edu. \n \n Caption: ERIC SYLVIA\n \nEmory Woods examines a slide through a microscope while mom Stephanie and Vicki Burchfield of the Caroline County Public Library look on. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Detecting problems with old plumbing and pipes\n\n November 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mid Shore Board Of Realtors | Page: 11 | Section: News \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - From providing a hot shower at the end of a long day to taking the wastewater out of our home without a smell, the indoor plumbing system is an unsung hero of our everyday lives.We rarely stop to think about the complexities involved in providing a clean glass full of water from our sinks until we step in a puddle on the floor.The indoor plumbing systems in our homes have been constructed throughout the past 150 years of many different materials, and some of those materials have lasted better than others.Daniel Morris, a certified master inspector with Blackwater Home Inspectors, is a preferred partner with Mid-Shore Board of Realtors and will relay some of the materials that throughout the years have shown to be deficient and how to identify them.When referencing residential plumbing, we generally are talking about our supply piping and drain piping. Let's talk about two materials found in the Mid-Shore area that have common issues, polybutylene piping and galvanized steel.Polybutylene piping was introduced in the late 1970s and used through the mid-1990s. Gray in appearance when installed in a home, the lettering \"PB-2110\" is often printed on the pipe.It was a flexible, cheap and easy to install material. The piping was installed in millions of homes throughout the U.S. because of those qualities.However, polybutylene piping has shown that it is more prone to leaks and deterioration of the pipe material itself. Several class action lawsuits against the manufacturers have taken place, and at this point, the pipe is considered obsolete and in need of replacement.Mobile homes and manufactured homes were often plumbed with this piping material, and it is still common to find these materials today. If you live in a home built in the 80s or 90s, take a second to look under your sink to see if you see any exposed gray piping.Galvanized steel was a product introduced in the 1940s. It consisted of a steel pipe that was dipped in a zinc coating to prevent corrosion.However, over time, with water running through the pipe, the zinc coating on the interior of the piping can wash away. This leads to the piping corroding on the inside and slowly closing the pipe in.Oftentimes, rust particles are introduced into the water running through the pipe, contaminating the water. It often will restrict the flow of water and result in a loss of water pressure.This piping can be identified by a dull, grayish/silver appearance.When the pipe is scratched it will be shiny, as opposed to lead, which will be dull in color.To best test the performance of this pipe, it is recommended you run multiple water fixtures for two minutes and watch for noticeable dips in water pressure. This piping material is past its lifespan at this point, and replacement of the material is recommended.All water pipes can leak, not just the two that are described above.Plumbing leaks are not just a minor inconvenience but can often lead to structural damage to a home if the leak is not caught quickly.There are several pieces of technology now that can help detect these leaks before they become an issue.There are small water alarms that can be placed in areas to detect any leaks and whole house leak detection meters that are installed on your water main and can shut off the water to the home if a leak is detected.Even some water heaters are coming installed with leak detectors.If you have questions about your plumbing system, a plumbing contractor or even a local home inspector can often be of assistance.Morris can be reached at 443-528-1633.

The date is significant because fighting between the Allied countries and Germany ended on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, marking the end of World War I.\"Stop and think about this day, Veterans Day, celebrating all the service and all the sacrifice of the U.S. Military Veterans,\" Feehley said to the students. \"Veterans sacrificed so that you and I have the freedoms we enjoy today.\" Each of the seven fifth-grade classes at the school provided one question for the veterans to answer.Brian S. asked \"what advice would you give an individual who was considering entering the military?\" Jasiah P. asked \"what is the most positive thing that happened to you because you served in the armed forces?\" \"The military gave us the chance to do something we had never done or would never do, like go to the Philippines, or for me, to learn about C-4 and other demolitions, fly in planes and helicopters, or be on a ship.\" said Mike Detmer, a former Marine and member the Dorchester County Council.\"It also gives you a chance to grow close to people. When you go through training and hardship or danger with other people, just like when you're on a football or soccer team, you feel a closeness with them. I have brothers who I love a lot, but I feel extremely close to my Marine brothers.\" \"When you have served in the military, you know that you've accomplished something,\" Detmer said, \"and you are serving something much bigger than yourself.You can see how proud all of these gentlemen are about what they've done. But it's not as much pride in what they personally have done, as it is pride in what they have been a part of. That is why I would encourage you to think about it.\" At the end of the assembly, the students presented cards to the veterans, which will be delivered to patients in a Maryland VA hospital during the holidays.\"Students in fifth grade across Talbot County write letters to veterans as part of their fifth grade service learning project,\" said Jeff Bell, Easton Elementary fifth grade teacher. \"It is only appropriate that we get those letters to veterans at this time of the year.\" \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF TALBOT COUNTY SCHOOLS\n \nStudents in fifth grade across Talbot County write letters to veterans as part of their fifth grade service learning project.

    "content": "Girl Scouts care for furry friends\n\n November 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tamara Forte; Special To The Kent County News Star Democrat | Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 536\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN - Excitement filled the Animal Care Shelter for Kent County in Chestertown on Nov. 11, as Claire Anderson-Schultz, Amelia Beach, Clara Gerber and Ayesha Tapia brought in lots of handmade supplies and needed items to the shelter. These four sixth graders earned their Bronze Award for Girl Scouts by setting their sights on helping the cats and dogs at the shelter.To earn their Bronze Awards, the girls from Troop 899 in Centreville had to complete 20 hours of service in a service project. Sharing a love for animals, it was easy to decide that the project would help animals in need. Claire's mom shared that Claire has been visiting animal shelters for years with her grandfather to spend time cuddling the animals after school.This past summer, the girls toured the facility to learn about what the shelter did and what it needed. From June to September, the girls worked independently and as a team to meet these needs. After reaching out and doing research, the girls learned the ACSKC had recently moved into a new building and had many needs.These needs included: a new cat tree, cat and dog toys, pet food and treats, new storage benches, and cleaning items. The girls explained the shelter had to throw out a beautiful, carpeted cat tree due to a sickness that had hit the shelter. The girls quickly began their mission to make a cat tree that was easy to clean and maintain.During these 20 hours or more of time, the girls strategized in meetings (in person and on Zoom) on how to meet these needs and then worked together to create and build the items needed. The cat tree was thoughtfully made, and with a little help from their parents, the girls found a plan that would use easy-to-clean PVC pipes. After making sure the pipes fit, they glued them together and painted them gold. The girls also made Velcro patches of fabric from reused clothing. \"These fabric patches were made from my grandpa's old jackets and now they can be velcroed off and on for easy washing\" explained Amelia.Shelter worker, Paige Tucker, said they currently have 109 dogs and cats at the animal shelter. Right now, there are 32 animals in need of homes. Allison Otadan, Shelter Media Coordinator, shared the shelter is \"so grateful for the efforts of the girls\" for the new cat trees and other pet items. She is excited for the new benches, as the current benches are all scratched up. At this shelter, there are special rooms for the animals to freely roam, but that also causes some of the items to get worn down and scratched. In addition to the cat tree and wooden benches, the girls sewed catnip toys, hand tied snuffle mats (where pet treats can be hidden and found), and collected lots of donations from their whole troop, grades kindergarten through fifth grade.If you would also like to help the shelter, they are currently in need of kitten food, cat food, dog food, and cat/dog treats. There is a complete Wish List on their website that includes the specific brands needed at https://acskc.org/ \n \n Caption: TAMARA FORTE\n \nThe girls get to play with the cats that need homes at the shelter. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He reached out to Leslie Sherman, the W. Alton Jones Professor of Chemistry and Environmental Science for Washington College.\"Advanced Placement courses are college-level work for high school students,\" said Geoffroy. \"I wanted my students to have the experience of using up-to-date technology and learn the processes of lab procedures, like independent work and safety.\" After donning goggles and lab coats, students began working with a freshman Chemistry class (led by the college's Chemistry lecturer Betsy Moyer-Taylor, the mother of one of the participating students, and assistant professor Jeremy Bard). Students were grouped with college students to complete the lab assignment of changing copper into various forms.A special visitor dropped by in the morning, Frank Keegan, Professor of Chemistry, Emeritus at Washington College who taught chemistry for over 40 years. Ceegan had a special visit with high school student Lucy Taylor, daughter of Moyer-Taylor, one of his former students, noting there were three generations of chemists there that day.\"I thought everything was pretty cool,\" said high school student Katie Harvey. \"The equipment here is way more advanced.\" Students were working with multiple modern \"hoods\" or ventilated enclosures throughout the room used to trap and exhaust vapors and gases, something that most high school classrooms today cannot afford to provide.High schooler Raven Fairbanks said that she felt comfortable with the process. \"We are following the same procedures we do in class.\" College student Terrance Vincent said he liked working with the younger students. \"It's keeping me honest,\" he said. \"I have to make sure everything is being done correctly.\" A brief Q & A with three upper level Chemistry majors followed with a tour of some of the fancier equipment in their facilities.\"My students loved hearing from the college students, and especially seeing that they were all double-majors. After our previous 'careers in chemistry' activity, I think it helped them to see the 'bridge' between themselves and those possible careers,\" Geoffroy said.Much of the discussion focused on the college students' workload (one was a student-athlete), as well as internships, jobs after college, and how their personal connections with their professors and advisors have helped them get those opportunities.Students were then treated to some liquid nitrogen demos from Sherman, applying some of the topics they had learned already.\"The big hits though were making (and eating) liquid nitrogen ice cream, and experimenting with different slime recipes,\" Geoffroy said.The group ended the trip with free t-shirts and lunch in the college's dining hall.Geoffroy said, \"We had many discussions during and after the trip about college in general, and it sounds like Washington College did a great job selling itself to some of our students.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nQueen Anne's County High School students Lucy Taylor and Hailey Gill and Washington College chemistry student Tarance Vincent watch for chemical reactions in a joint lab last week. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We want every kid to experience these things that will help them to make prudent economic career decisions.\" Orr said the group of four is currently working on bylaws. The purpose of the foundation \"shall be to enhance, inspire and support educational opportunities in the area of financial literacy for all students attending Caroline County public schools,\" he said.On Nov. 16, Rowe said, \"The four of us decided that, at least at this point, it would be more impactful to focus our efforts on a specific area like financial literacy, as opposed to everything, because we just don't have a lot of money.If we get more money, then we can expand the mission, but for right now we're going to hold pat with financial literacy.\" Rowe said the founders \"will be setting up a meeting soon get our bylaws adopted and make decisions as to who could serve with us.If anyone knows of anyone in the community that would be good for this organization, we would love to have a conversation.\" \"Times are changing, and this financial literacy piece is going to become so important and we're going to grow this fund,\" said Cole, chief financial officer of WIN Transport, Inc. in Federalsburg.\"Financial literacy obviously is very powerful,\" Simmons said.\"Caroline County is still one of the only systems in the state that requires all of our high schoolers to complete a full credit of a finance course before graduation, and I'm glad we have that, but at the same time, one only has to look at the current economic situation we're in to realize that one credit during your high school experience in one county on Maryland's Eastern Shore is not solving a fiscal issue that's in front of us everywhere.But financial literacy is a massive undertaking and needed.\" Simmons explained that CCPS was the first to sign a memorandum of understanding with Junior Achievement of the Eastern Shore regarding providing students opportunities at the organization's 25,000 square-foot regional facility under construction in Salisbury.\"It's a great center, but it's also a great program that they put together, working with businesses and communities across the Eastern Shore (and it's) great, strong curriculum coming in,\" Simmons said. The curriculum aligns with the Maryland State Department of Education's requirements.He said the foundation would be in a good position to help with costs associated with students getting to the facility.\"We are the furthest distance from the center and we have the highest degree of poverty,\" Simmons said. \"We're the (school) system that has the most need with the least amount of funds to spend to get our kids there, and we have the greatest distance to drive to get there.\" He added that the Blueprint, which requires career exploration as well as dual enrollment, also requires counties to fund compliance with the legislation.\"We're required to pay for everybody's dual enrollment who are enrolled in our high schools,\" Simmons said. \"The math in Blueprint doesn't add up. They did not take financial literacy.\" \"That's where Blueprint stands right now, and we'll do our part,\" he said. He added that the foundation could \"help support other things that we're trying to do.\" \n \n Caption: SCREENSHOT\n \nDenton businessmen Bob Willey, at the lectern, and Tolbert Rowe on Nov. 7 explain how the Caroline County Education Foundation will fund financial literacy efforts for students. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hale and the class were excited to make this idea a reality.Since then, AMP cabinets with dartboard with darts included have been one of AMP's most popular products, selling out even before they were presented.Each time AMP students manufacture a product, they follow the same template.It begins with research, mood-boarding and a product pitch. With dartboards, students research the history, rules and professional leagues in the game of darts. Then each student must come up with a design for the project, followed by drafting their design and placing it on a Mood Board.This Mood Board becomes a visual they can refer to as they present their product pitch.Business partners, school officials, parents and former students are then invited to watch the students' product pitches Oct. 26.One by one, students manage the difficult task of individually pitching the details and merits of their designs to the class and guests in attendance.At the end of the presentations, everyone votes and a design is chosen.The next step in the process is called \"napkin sketching,\" which is a sketch of the product views and dimensions.These sketches are then taken to the computer aided drafting lab, where more accurate prints are made. From those prints, numeric commands are created that will drive a computer numeric control machine, which is a robot programmed to cut pieces out of stock material.Once complete, an audience is once again assembled for student presentations of the finished products, which are also offered for sale. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF CCPS\n \nAdvanced Manufacturing Program students at Caroline Career and Technology Center presented design ideas for their current project, a dartboard cabinet, on Oct. 26.

Com | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 718\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN - This past September, Ashley Singer was holding a tutoring session with a student when they both began to sense a mechanical burning smell.After exiting the building and calling 911, they waited as local responders arrived.Crews quickly gained control of the smoke situation, but the damage had been done.Singer, Executive Director of Open Doors Partners in Education, said it was a saddening setback. \"Though we had insurance, there was an estimated $40,000 loss of materials due to exposure to toxic smoke.\"Enter Associate Director Julie Blyman who had served as a crisis manager at a school.\"It was really catastrophic,\" said Blyman, \"but then we got so much support from the community.\"Singer and Blyman met when they were at the Radcliffe Creek School. The school provided them literacy training and both found early on that tutoring was what they were meant to do. Their Open Doors Partners in Education is a literacy focused organization, founded in 2020 as a direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting learning loss in local schools.As graduates of Kent County Public Schools and residents of the county, they were alarmed to watch students who were already struggling fall even further behind.\"We felt the need to do something to help and the decision was made to create a literacy focused nonprofit organization\" said Singer. \"We initially wanted to help students in first and second grade, a time when intervention can be most efficient and successful,\" said Singer, \"but as word spread through the county, students of all ages, pre-k through 9th grade, were found on our roster.\"To date, the organization has assisted over 100 students in the Orton-Gillingham literacy method, a direct, multi-sensory, structured, sequential, diagnostic and prescriptive way to teach literacy when reading, writing, and spelling that does not come easily to individuals, such as those with dyslexia.When the fire happened, the two were amazed by the support of local community organizations, including Washington College, the YMCA, and Stam's downtown.It took only one day for them to take an offer from Emmanuel Episcopal Church to use their Sunday school classrooms.Knowing that they needed a more permanent location, the group worked with Sam Shoge of Rivers & Roads Construction to find an appropriate location. They toured office space in the Lynchburg building and worked with KRM Development Corp. to get the space ready as soon as possible.Open Doors depends on grant funding to exist and has worked with Kit Cares, Inc., a charity navigator and a fiscal sponsor for their 501\u00a93 organization. The funding provides the organization the ability to offer free services to Kent County students.\"By partnering with local schools, we can provide intensive 1:1 structured literacy instruction at no cost to the families,\" said Singer.\"We hope to reach those students who might otherwise fall through the cracks.\"The organization is also working with a nonprofit consultant on a strategic five-year plan. \"We would love to be working more with Kent Co. and Queen Anne's County Public Schools,\" said Singer. They would also like to enhance their bilingual program. \"Research says the Orton-Gillingham literacy method is the best literacy training program for bi-lingual students,\" she said.Since the fire, the organization is in need of replenishing their paperback book library for students ages 5-16. The organization also has a wish list on Amazon.com.Why are Singer and Blyman so committed to their mission? Singer said, \"It is the lightbulb moment when students discover why they want to read, when they realize that a book is an adventure, and they realize they can have many more.\"Blyman said it is all about why students come to the office for a session. \"To know that they are coming here willingly after a hard day of school, that is really inspiring,\" said Blyman. \"And it's very rewarding when we see that parents are so relieved that their children are ok to come here and know they will get the help they need.\"The Open Doors Partners in Education will have a ribbon cutting at their new location, 116-D South Lynchburg Street in Chestertown, on Dec. 1 at 5 p.m.For more information on Open Doors, go to www. opendoorsed.org. \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nAshley Singer, executive director, and Julie Blyman, associate director of Open Doors Partners in Education have opened their new location in Chestertown after a fire displaced them from their original office. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Apprenticeships explored at local high schools\n\n November 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Laura Tayman; tayman@chespub.com | Page: 2 | Section: News \n \n 696\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n While high school students are still tasked with learning English, math, history, and science, career apprenticeships are being revitalized in Queen Anne's County and across the country, educating future workers and preparing them with marketable skills sought in high-demand industries.Karen Hesson of Kent Island High School and Betsy Ricketts of Queen Anne's County High School are in their first year serving as their school's Career Coach for students, a new position the county created this year.\"There is so much information available for students now, and it is hard for them and their families to navigate through it,\" said Hesson. \"We help students identify what interests them and how to get to where they need to be to meet their goals, whether it is college, trade schools, or working directly with businesses to allow students to learn on the job.\" Hesson and Ricketts worked together on securing a week's worth of visitors available to meet with students during a part of their lunchtime. From military and law enforcement to county government and local businesses who are needing workers with specific skills, all were on hand to answer questions and discuss options for the future.One of the presenters was Connie Dean, the Career Technology Liaison for the Queen Anne's County Economic & Tourism Development department. Dean is assisting the two schools with finding businesses who are interested in the apprenticeship program.\"Students are first given skills that would be required to work in a certain business field,\" said Dean. Then the students work 450 hours at a partnering business to earn their official apprenticeship recognition.\"I try to tell businesses internships are a bigger commitment, when the apprenticeship program would be appropriate for future workers in their field,\" she said.Currently, there are three Kent Island students who were trained in the culinary department at Chesapeake College this semester.Aly Swann said she learned about the basics like cutting meat, how to work with knives and other kitchen tools, and how to make sauces. \"I know now 100% that this is what I want to do for a living,\" she said.James Smith said the school was really helpful in letting him work some during the school day. \"I appreciate that I got a pathway for my career. I have learned skills I will use for a long time,\" said Smith.Last Tuesday, was military and law enforcement day for the Queen Anne's apprentice week, with recruiters from all armed forces branches, answering questions about basic training, money for college, and traveling the globe.Troopers Christopher Bekefiand Doug Prince provided information on the Maryland State Police Cadet program, where students aged 17-19 are assigned to perform duties that do not require police authority (example helping with crowds at large public events). Cadets are also assigned to work under the supervision of a Trooper at a truck inspection station or on patrol.They also have an explorer program for students aged 14-18, where they are introduced to various divisions and tactics like crime scene investigations, traffic stops, and forensics.Adam Tolley, supervisor of Career and Technology Education for Queen Anne's Public Schools, was pleased to see so many students engaging with a variety of workforce representatives. \"This is a very organized way to provide students who are beginning to think about real career options,\" he said.County Commissioner Philip Dumenil was present to view the new apprentice week program first hand at Queen Anne's High School. \"I like new opportunities for exposure to these kind of programs,\" said Dumenil. \"Lots of money can still be made in the trade fields. Not every kid wants to go to college.\" Queen Anne's student Austin Hahn, just a sophomore, has already chosen a career for his future, and that, said Ricketts, makes him a perfect apprentice candidate.Hahn has chosen to pursue a career in marine mechanics and pipe welding and wishes to move to the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana or Texas where he has family. \"My grandfather taught me a lot about it,\" said Hahn. \"He said it would be the best money I could ever make. When he passed away, I knew I would definitely do it.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nNew Career Coach Betsy Ricketts stands beside the poster for Queen Anne's County High School's first apprenticeship week schedule. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The club was one of only ten clubs within Rotary District 7630 to receive the award. The district is comprised of 39 clubs throughout Maryland's Eastern Shore and the entire state of Delaware.The Rotary Citation award recognizes those clubs that support each of Rotary International's strategic priorities by achieving goals over the course of the Rotary year in areas such as participation in community service and leadership development; sponsoring students for the Rotary Youth Leadership Academy; club membership and district participation.Immediate Past President Judy Price, who served as president of the club during the 2022-2023 Rotary Year, and current club president Matthew Schiwy accepted the award from Immediate Past District Governor Clifford Berg at a recent Rotary Foundation dinner held on Nov. 10 at the Wild Quail Country Club in Camden-Wyoming, Delaware.The club also received congratulations from 2022-2023 Rotary International President Jennifer Jones of Ontario, Canada. In her letter, Jones commended the Centreville club for earning \"the most significant award a Rotary club can achieve. This past year, your club demonstrated a commitment to achieve its goals, which ultimately helps strengthen Rotary and shape our future.\" In addition to receiving the Citation Award, the Centreville Rotary Club was also recognized for exceptional contributions by its membership to the Rotary Foundation, receiving the distinguished \"100% Foundation Giving Banner\" and the \"Every Rotarian, Every Year Banner.\" The Centreville Rotary Club, established in 1927, was one of the first Rotary clubs established in the United States. With its \"Service above Self\" motto, the Centreville club is known for its Rotary House benefitting certain families at risk; scholarships and leadership programs for high school students, dictionaries for third graders, Wells for Life, and for supporting a wide variety of organizations in Queen Anne's County.

    "content": "MCAP results show signs of recovery from pandemic learning loss - Science scores still show decline\n\n November 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Aya Hussein; Capital News Service | Page: 27 | Section: News \n \n 840\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n COLLEGE PARK - The results for the 2023 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program tests for grades 3 to 8 show that student proficiency in English Language Arts has surpassed the level it was at before the pandemic.Math scores have improved, but have yet to fully rebound from the pandemic, while science scores have declined, according to the Maryland State Department of Education.MCAP tests are administered annually in public schools to assist educators in understanding student progression so that they can better tailor their methods of instruction, according to MSDE.Students in grades 3 to 8 take tests in English and math, while students in grades 5 and 8 are given an additional science test.ENGLISH PROFICIENCY SURPASSES 2019According to data from MSDE, average English proficiency dropped from 44% in 2019 to 31% in 2021.Proficiency increased significantly in 2022 and by a smaller degree in 2023, with results showing an average passing rate of 47%, according to MSDE.Improvements can be seen across Maryland, as every county except Somerset had an increase in English proficiency between 2022 and 2023.MATH PROFICIENCY STILL BELOW PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELSThe 24% average passing rate for math in 2023 is still lower than the 31% in 2019, indicating that math scores have still not fully recovered from pandemic learning loss.Despite average passing rates in math still not being as high as in 2019, they have gone up since dropping to 15% in 2021. Proficiency increased by 6 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and 3 percentage points from 2022 to 2023.Not every county had an improvement, as there are four counties that saw a decline in average math proficiency from 2022 to 2023: Baltimore, Kent, Somerset and Talbot.Baltimore County Public Schools Board of Education Member at Large Tiara Booker-Dwyer said that an explanation for the slower improvement in math scores is that the format of math questions in these tests have become more layered, which makes it difficult for parents, teachers and administrators trained in the traditional format to help students get accustomed.HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED STUDENTS LAG BEHINDDespite making improvements over the last two years, average scores for historically underserved students in English and math still lag behind. The most recent scores of Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino and American Indian/Alaska Native students are still below those of white and Asian students.Booker-Dwyer said that it is important to build the cultural competency of educators so that they can connect better with students.\"When you look at the curriculum that was developed, it speaks to a certain demographic.There are certain people who just 'I'm not going to connect with this,' so it's going to go in one ear and out the other. Or when they try to connect to it, people recognize that it's inauthentic,\" Booker-Dwyer said.Booker-Dwyer states that another solution is encouraging more historically underserved students to take honors and AP classes, as well as providing resources to schools to give them these opportunities.\"What the research shows is that if you're placed in an advanced academic class or gifted class, even if you're earning C's in there, you're better off long term than if you're just in the standard class,\" Booker-Dwyer said.\"Sometimes it's just exposure to certain things, just being in a classroom, around students who are performing at a certain level will kind of unintentionally make you perform at a higher level,\" she said.GRADE 8 SCIENCE PROFICIENCY HITS FIVEYEAR LOWScience scores continue to lag, especially for grade 8.In grade 5, science proficiency in the last five years peaked in 2021 at 41%, a 12-percentage point increase from 2019. In 2022, the passing rate dropped to 31% before rising again to 35% in 2023, according to MSDE.Grade 8 scores have been on a steady decline since 2021, with the passing rate dropping from 35% in 2022 to 26% in 2023, the lowest it's been in the last five years.With the exception of Dorchester, every county had at least a 10% decline in grade 8 science proficiency from 2022 to 2023. Six counties had over a 30% decrease from 2022: Kent, Charles, Prince George's, Washington, Allegany and Queen Anne's.MSDE states that this decline is likely due to the grade 8 students being in grade 6 during the 2020-2021 school year, which was predominantly online. As a result, students missed key science instruction during their first year of middle school.\"The results on the grade 8 assessment make clear the impact of grade 6 and 7 disruptions on a cumulative grade 8 assessment,\" MSDE said in the press release.Booker-Dwyer stated that rollout for the new Next Generation Science Standards for K-12 education, which has lessons in engineering, technology, earth and space sciences in addition to traditional sciences, was delayed by the pandemic.She remains optimistic that scores will improve as curriculum continues to change.\"I do believe it will get better as people are getting more and more comfortable with the science standards and more teachers are getting trained and the resources are getting better, as far as the instructional material,\" Booker-Dwyer said. \"But initially it was tough.\" The 2024 MCAP tests are set to begin in the spring. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now, they are peeling the skin off Caroline County grown sweet potatoes to create more sweet potato pies to keep up with holiday demand.\"We are processing some baskets of sweet potatoes today. We also have some pumpkins getting ready for our Christmas Bake Sale.We do biscuits again and fresh apple cakes and carrot cakes and pumpkin maple torts and an array of cookies. We have between 75 and 100 kids involved,\" said Linda Brown, who teaches the class and has been teaching culinary arts for over four decades.For some of these students, she taught their parents.Francis Blazejak, a retired police officer, delivers a delicious, smaller varietal of potatoes. He donates all the potatoes not fit for sale to the Easton High culinary program.They are steamed and peeled and processed to a smooth paste in a blender.\"This morning there were three dirty boxes of potatoes as if they were just dug out of the ground.The kids washed them and dumped them into a big sink and got them into the steamer,\" Brown said.The culinary instructor said there is no room in her kitchen for laziness. Everybody was quiet and focused on their task as radio station WCEI plays Christmas ditties in the background. There was an earthy, sweet scent in the air, and everyone's fingers were dyed orange.\"We put between five and six apples in each pie, depending on the size of the apple,\" Brown said. \"You can think of how many apples we peel. I go to PA and get my apples because they are right off the tree, and I use a variety, so it has some golden delicious and some tart granny smiths.\" She loves working with the students, seeing them take pride in sliding out a sheet tray of six pies and knowing they have 94 more to go.Although this effort is geared towards the holiday season, Brown sees a larger picture of success.Many of her students go on to culinary schools. Some of her students have gone on to work at the Inn at Perry Cabin is St.Michaels.\"We are preparing them for working in a restaurant or going to college in culinary,\" Brown said.\"Chesapeake, Anne Arundal, but most of our kids go to CIA (Culinary Institute of America) or Johnson and Wales. It sets you up for school or to be industry ready.Our program is way more flexible, so we a get much more flexible student population.\" \"They establish a lot of pride and get some interest in doing it right,\" she said.This is her 48th year of teaching.Her right hand man is her former student Joseph Candel, who went to the Baltimore International School. He has worked in kitchens in Ireland.Candel was working as a sous chef in Cambrige and had only been there for ten months when he got a call. It was former EHS Principal Tim Thurber who told him a spot had opened up a couple of days before school started.\"This was a great opportunity.I had to do some soul searching, you know, I have taken every opportunity that I can, to better myself. That was 18 years ago,\" said Candel. He still thinks he made a great decision.Candel and Brown share a philosophy, \"Mise en place,\" which is French for everything in its place.Like in carpentry, they believe in measuring twice and cutting once.Harlin Bartolon is a sophomore at EHS and is fully invested in working in the food industry.\"I have learned how to properly measure stuff, how to cut properly and how to do the stuff right in the kitchen. I want to go to Johnson and Wales University in Rhode Island,\" Bartolon said.\"They have more opportunities to do stuff internationally. They can get you jobs all over the world - like internships.\" He peeled a lot of sweet potatoes, and there was a mountain of orange flesh at his station. He seemed relaxed and focused as the skin fell away.\"It is easy if you use the back of the knife to peel. I hope we inspire kids to cook. Inspire them to do better in life,\" Bartolon said.\"The community really likes to buy the pies to support the program.The money that we take in on bake sales, that is the money that pays for our supplies. We charge $8 for a pie, $5 for a dozen biscuits and $4 for cookies,\" Brown said.The bakers take orders by phone at 410-822-6965. They can't handle much more demand, Brown said, so there have been no holiday ads on Facebook.They make fresh pies on Mondays and Tuesday. Their last holiday deadline is Dec. 14 for Dec. 19 delivery. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nLinda Brown, EHS culinary teacher, shows off one of culinary student's pies.

We're fully aware that that's going to be a very big lift for us.\" Beachy said that for the two years following 2024, \"without another funding stream becoming available, we will drop back down to three elementary schools with a total of 400 students.\" In other business, the commissioners approved a $1,011,834 contract with Nashville-based Wellpath LLC to provide medical services for inmates at the county jail.Two surplus vehicles will be offered for sale, deemed by the County Commissioners to be \"no longer needed, outdated, unsafe, or (their) condition has deteriorated to the point that maintenance costs exceeds its practical value.\" A 2012 Dodge ambulance with 211,797 miles and a 2014 Dodge Ram with 218,742 miles will be auctioned locally.Ryan White has left his position as director of the Department of Public Works, and that position may be reconfigured before it is advertised.Commission Vice President Larry Porter expressed some concern about \"the scope of what is going to be able to be done by public works.\" \"At some point, in my opinion, (it's) going to have to be reduced. There's going to have to be more things contracted out,\" Porter said.Commission President Travis Breeding said, \"I've been giving this position a lot of thought, and I think it would be helpful to have someone there who is wellversed in the design process, permitting process, bid process.I almost feel like it's a two-person role.\" The next Caroline County Commission meeting will be held 9 a.m. Tuesday, Dec.5, in Room 106, Caroline County Courthouse, 109 Market St., Denton.Meetings are held 9 a.m.Tuesdays except the fifth Tuesday of the month, unless announced otherwise.

    "content": "School principals prepare for the Blueprint For Maryland's Future\n\n November 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Cait Kelley And Caley Fox Shannon | Page: 12 | Section: News \n \n 777\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OCEAN CITY - As Maryland rolls out the 2021 landmark education reform law called the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, many school administrators are unsure what the plan means for their schools.At the annual School Leaders Conference held Nov. 2-4 in Ocean City, state officials and school principals reviewed the details of the Blueprint and discussed how it will be implemented in each school district.The wave of impending policy changes are meant to address the challenges facing educators and students across the state.The Blueprint is grounded in the analysis of a group of independent policy experts formed by the state in 2016 to establish a baseline for education reform.The group was commonly referred to as the Kirwan Commission after its chair, William E. Kirwan, chancellor emeritus of the University System of Maryland.By 2019, the Kirwan Commission had come to some sobering conclusions about Maryland's education system.Half of all teachers leave the profession within the first five years. Only two out of every five kindergarteners arrive in the classroom ready to learn. And just a third of students leave high school being \"college and career ready\" in English and math.\"That was pre-pandemic.So generally speaking, it's gotten worse,\" said Rachel Hise, a policy specialist who worked for the state in tandem with the Kirwan Commission.Explaining the commission's findings to school leaders in Ocean City, she said the independent body concluded that \"ultimately, the status quo is unsustainable.\"The Maryland General Assembly passed the Blueprint for Maryland's Future in February 2021, overriding a veto by then-Gov.Larry Hogan, a Republican who had cost concerns about the plan.The Blueprint allocates $3.8 billion to schools over the next 10 years.Hise is now executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board. She said the policy changes will make sure students are ready to learn in kindergarten and ready to succeed when they graduate high school.Because public schools lack the capacity to fulfill this mandate alone, the state will fund programming via private pre-K providers as well.\"The goal is a socioeconomically integrated pre-K system that is publicly funded, but that is provided by both public schools and private providers,\" Hise told administrators in Ocean City.The Blueprint will also mean big changes in high schools.\"What the Blueprint really envisions is we want kids to be college and career ready by 10th grade, so that the second two years of high school students can focus on the pathway that they're interested in pursuing,\" Hise said.The Blueprint aims to meet this goal through curriculum changes in English and math in addition to apprenticeships and technical education programs.Implementing the Blueprint at the school level falls squarely on school administrators, said Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\"There was no doubt that the Blueprint would be a part of this conference, and the understanding of the Blueprint is actually key,\" she said in an interview.After learning more about the Blueprint at the conference, some principals said they are hopeful that the reforms will address their schools' priorities.Teachers are struggling to make do with salaries in the current economy, said Principal Ryan Daniel of Fort Foote Elementary in Prince George's County.\"I know a lot of my teachers have to have after-school jobs or second jobs to compensate for their salary,\" she said.The Blueprint will raise the minimum salary for teachers to $60,000 across the state by 2026. And if teachers obtain National Board Certification, the Blueprint allows them to earn up to an additional $17,000 per year.Other schools have yet to feel the concrete impact of the Blueprint.\"Honestly, I'm still reading and learning, and I think that they're doing a really slow roll out intentionally for us, which is good,\" said Jamie Miller, the principal at Broadneck Elementary in Arnold. \"We have people at the board level who are becoming sort of experts and then they're going to disseminate to us.\"Miller expressed a mix of excitement about the expansion of pre-K and trepidation about her school's capacity to meet the need.In March 2023, every school district submitted a detailed plan to the Accountability and Implementation Board for rolling out the Blueprint in their schools.\"The plans are fine, but they really are a baseline,\" Hise said. \"There's a need for more innovative thinking.\"The Accountability and Implementation Board expects updated plans from every district in March 2024, and has offered every district a $100,000 grant to hire a strategic planning expert. All but Frederick and Worcester counties took the state up on that deal. \n \n Caption: Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board, presents on Maryland's plan to improve early childhood education. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Fretterd Community Center.A number of Caroline County Public School sophomores had the opportunity to visit with representatives from a variety of businesses and attend workshops to help them explore career possibilities before they graduate from high school.Hosted by the Rotary Club of Denton, the 10th Grade Career Exploration Fair was sponsored by Smiles by Holsinger, Shore United Bank, Summit Community Bank and Sisk Fulfillment.The Denton Rotary has been providing this yearly event to 10th grade students since 2013; however, the COVID pandemic temporarily suspended it.\"The purpose of the event is to spark an interest and open up career possibilities to our 10th graders so they can be career ready when they graduate,\" said Sue Simmons, a Denton Rotarian and the event chair.This year was the highest attendance ever, with 97 students from Colonial Richardson High School, North County High School and the Caroline Career and Technology Center, who were split up into groups for the day. Nearly 30 small and large businesses set up vendor exhibits.Each group was assigned to a table with a business mentor - an adult to help match them with possible careers that are compatible with their interests or expose them to new ideas and opportunities to consider.Students were encouraged to explore careers that match their personal interests, such as working outside, being a problem solver, caring for others or owning their own business.Each student also attended two of the four workshops that were offered. Workshops included \"Unlocking Your Potential at Chesapeake College\" by Marci Leach, director of program development at Chesapeake Community College, and J.P. Kelly, business and industry navigator at Chesapeake Community College; \"Mental Health Means Inner Wealth\" by Sara Porter-Lepore, LCSW-C, and Cara Calloway, mental health coordinator for CCPS; \"How To Rock a Job Interview\" by Deborah Boulden, youth outreach coordinator for the Upper Shore Workforce Investment Board; and \"Way to Be: Exploring Career Interests\" by Abigail Trice, Next Generation Scholars coordinator for Caroline County.Participating students also had the opportunity to meet students from other schools, as each group was pre-assigned to their tables by Lindsey McCormick, CCPS director of college and career.Ten juniors who attended the fair last year returned as mentors to help guide the sophomores through the day.A bonus to the program was a special visit from Devon Beck, an NCHS graduate, songwriter, hip hop artist, podcaster and Talbot County Public Schools Equity Facilitator. Beck shared with the students his own story and provided a positive message about being true to themselves and finding a career that is meaningful to them.The Rotary Club of Denton thanked Dr. Derek Simmons, McCormick and Robert Gowen from the CCPS Board of Education; Eric Cook, Ann Ferkler, and Brad Plutschak from CCPS; as well as table mentors Danielle Forrest of Shore United, Linda Prochaska of Appleseed Books, Victor Reynolds of CASA of Caroline, Richard Warfield of the Caroline Review, Esther Curtis of SUN Behavioral Health), Desiree Jefferson and America McKinney of His Hope Ministries, Kristi English of APG Media Chesapeake, Angel Perez of the Caroline Culinary Arts Center, Kat Stork of Shore Strategies LLC, and Sarah Kilmon of Talbot County Communications. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF DENTON ROTARY\n \nCaroline County sophomore explore career options with local businesses and organizations Nov. 21. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Superintendent Outlines Budget Priorities, Timeline\n\n December 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; Cconnolly@Chespub.Com | Page: 15 | Section: News \n \n 785\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - The conundrum of uncertain Blueprint demands coupled with a projected decrease in pandemic-related grant funding for Caroline County Public Schools is proving to be a challenge for Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons, school administrators and district staff as they build a budget for fiscal year 2025.And because the dilemma impacts the traditional budgeting timeline employed in previous years, at the Dec. 5 meeting of the Caroline County Board of Education, the Superintendent Simmons received more time to develop a more realistic budget.\nThe Board of Education approved Simmons's request to revise the traditional timeline and move his final budget proposal from February to April.\n\"We do not have a good idea of what state revenues look like until the General Assembly gets done doing their work, which is April,\" Simmons said.\nWhile some demands of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a set of policies and spending for education in the state's public schools, are clear, others are still being modified. The \"uncertainties\" of the unfunded legislative mandate have created budgetary challenges for school administrators across the state.\nOne of the demands for school districts is funding dual enrollment for high school students who wish to take college courses. Blueprint's College and Career Readiness standards require school districts to pay for any student who meets the minimum requirements for dual enrollment. At roughly $1,000 per student per semester, CCPS spent $130,000 in 2023 for juniors and seniors to take courses at Chesapeake College. While \"it's great for the kids,\" Simmons said, the Blueprint requirement presents a budget challenge.\nAnother \"cost of doing Blueprint business\" is meeting the mandated starting teacher salary of $60,000 by fiscal year 2027.\nGrant funding \"is kind of how Caroline County has survived,\" Simmons said.\nBut some of that funding will decrease or cease altogether in 2024.\nBoth American Rescue Plan and Maryland Leads grant funding will sunset in Sept. 2024. In addition, the funding formula for Blueprint shows a 1.7% increase in state funding from last year, the lowest per year increase in the formula, Simmons said.\nThe CCPS budget, typical of school systems across the state is 80% people, Simmons said.\n\"The rule of thumb is anywhere between 80% to 90% of your budget is people, and when you take people out and you take out paying for your electric and your fuel and heating your buildings and running your buses and those sorts of things, you're probably left with somewhere between the neighborhood of 5% to 7% every year that truly is discretionary,\" Simmons said.\nAnd while \"about 14% of our money comes from the county government, the rest of it comes from state and federal, which is also why those numbers are important,\" he said.\nMost categories in Blueprint require financing at the school level, adding additional elements of complexity and compliance, and requiring full time accounting level position, Simmons said.\nBesides Blueprint's requirements, budget pressures also include the rate of inflation at over 3.5%, multiyear contracts that will come up for renewal in 2024 that will likely be higher than the rate of inflation and global issues impacting the cost of goods, including fuel.\nHowever, the budgeting challenge is not \"all doom and gloom,\" Simmons said.\nCaroline County has schools that qualify for \"concentration of poverty\" grant funding. While the funding is restricted to individual schools and can't support programs or positions at the district level, it helps take some pressure off the district to fund, for example, an afterschool program or reading intervention at a specific school.\nFederalsburg and Greensboro elementary schools already qualify; Colonel Richardson Middle School received its first concentration of poverty grant in 2023.\n\"It's likely we will see multiple other schools added as the Free and Reduced Meals rates maintain or increase,\" Simmons said. Because the concentration of poverty funding formula relies on Free and Reduced Meals data, Simmons said, \"I feel very confident all nine of our schools will get there.\"\nAs for the budgeting process, Simmons and his team will continue to work on the budget, try to find funding sources and work with the County finance office into 2024. Negotiating with the teachers' association will play a role, as well as a joint budget meeting with the Caroline County Commissioners.\n\"We also have a very good working relationship with the county commissioners,\" Simmons said. \"We are not one of those counties that walks over to the county commissioners and drops an additional increase of $3, 4 or 5 million on them.\" The final CCPS budget is due to the county commissioners by the end of June.\nPriorities in the fiscal year 2025 CCPS budget are competitive salaries and benefits for all employees, maintaining reasonable staffing levels across the district, maintaining high yield positions and programs that were included in pandemic-related grants and implementing the Blueprint as required. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Com | Page: 2 | Section: News \n \n 937\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - At a Talbot County Board of Education meeting Wednesday, administrators gave an update on the school system's priorities.Talbot County Public Schools' three priorities, identified in the spring, are academic equity and achievement, fostering an engaging environment and hiring and retaining highly qualified and diverse staff.\nSince sharing the priorities with the entire school system in August, Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said they have been working to \"infuse\" the priorities everywhere.\n\"In my roundtables, out in the community, in schools,\" she said. \"We're constantly talking about those three priorities.\"\nAt the meeting, strategies and metrics associated with each priority were shared.\nACADEMIC EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT When it comes to academic equity and achievement, TCPS has six strategies, including implementing additional interventions for students in and outside the classroom, hiring additional math coaches and implementing more assessments to measure growth.\nAssistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction Helga Einhorn said that since improving math was identified as a priority by the board, the district has added the NWEA MAP Growth Assessment for mathematics.\n\"Prior to this year, we did not have a standardized assessment that would allow us to collect this type of data as we had with reading,\" Einhorn said. \"We felt it was important, if we were going to make changes throughout the year, to progress monitor our students throughout the year.\"\nStudents in kindergarten through fifth grade took the beginning of the year MAP Growth Assessment for mathematics.\nEinhorn said teachers were impressed with how well students performed.\nOverall, 14% of those students were in the 80th percentile or higher, 19% were between the 61st and 80th percentile, 18% were between the 41st and 60th percentile, 21% were between the 21st and 40th percentile and 25% were between the 1st and 20th percentile.\nAlong with measuring growth through testing throughout the year, Einhorn said teachers are working very closely with the K-6 Math Curriculum Supervisor Daisy Bradwell.\n\"They are doing a deep dive into the curriculum,\" Einhorn said, adding that Bradwell is working with teachers to identify what things might be missing from the curriculum.\nFOSTERING AN ENGAGING ENVIRONMENT Director of Student Services Darlene Spurrier started off her presentation by listing different strategies the district is employing to achieve fostering an engaging environment.\nThese strategies include school-based mental health services and substance abuse intervention and prevention; restorative practices training; and individual school wellness plans and wellness coaches.\n\"Many of (these strategies) are ongoing and will not ever really move to completed because they're things that we're just going to continue to do,\" she said.\nWhen it came to data, Spurrier shared the results of three climate surveys - an internal survey from this year and the Maryland School Climate Surveys from last year and the year before that. Each of the surveys measure student and educator attitudes on four domains: community, environment, relationships and safety.\nComparing the student survey TCPS took this year to the state's survey from last year, within those four domains, students considered physical safety, physical environment and participation and engagement significantly better this year than the previous two years.\nComparing the teacher survey TCPS took this year to the state's survey from last year, teachers also ranked participation and engagement and physical safety significantly higher. They also ranked substance abuse higher than last year, meaning it is less of a concern in schools this year. Teachers ranked bullying lower on the scale this year compared to last year, meaning it is more of a concern.\nHIGHLY QUALIFIED AND DIVERSE STAFF Assistant Superintendent for Administrative and Support Services Lynne Duncan presented data on new hires, recruitment and TCPS's Grow Your Own Teachers Scholarship Program.\nBefore she spoke, Pepukayi said that retaining, not just recruiting, is important to the district.\n\"With the shortages across our nation in education, we want to make sure the people who are here, we're tending to,\" she said.\nAccording to Duncan's presentation, last school year, 197 out of 234 people, or 84%, accepted offers of employment.\nThis year, 90 out of 126 people, or 71%, accepted offers of employment.\nDuncan said that, to date, four of those new hires this year have left employment.\nIn terms of demographics of new teaching staff this year, 32 teachers are white and two are Hawaiian.\nTCPS attended seven recruitment fairs last school year. Duncan said it yielded one support staff employee.\nThe district plans to attend a total of eight recruiting events this school year. So far, it has visited three.\nOf the five people enrolled in the district's Grow Your Own Teachers Scholarship Program last year, four have been hired. The program gives TCPS students enrolled in college a scholarship if they agree to teach in the district after they graduate. Duncan said that of the nine remaining students enrolled in the program, one will graduate this month, one will graduate in June of 2024, three will graduate in 2026 and four will graduate in 2027.\nAt the end of the meeting, board member Jymil Thompson said he could see that the administrative team has clear vision, alignment and transparency.\n\"I think you all do a fabulous, fabulous job of that,\" he said. \"I want to see where the district's going to be in a couple years because I think it's definitely trickling in the right direction. So I'm anxious to be a part of that.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TRO VATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi speaks at a Board of Education meeting Dec. 13 in Easton.\n\n MAGGIE TRO VATO/MTRO VATO@CHESPUB.COM\n\n Talbot County Board of Education President Emily Jackson (pictured) and Vice President Candace Henry were reelected as president and vice president during a board meeting Dec. 13. \"It's a pleasure to serve in this role, and I'm excited to do it again for another year,\" Jackson said at the meeting. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Submissions are narrowed down to about a dozen finalists and, in keeping with long-standing tradition, the superintendent chooses the winner.\nAt the Dec. 5 board of education meeting, Supervisor of Instruction Renee Hesson unveiled Smith's artwork, and presented her with a certificate. Summer's family, CRHS art teacher Melanie Bolles and CRHS Principal Jared Sherman were also in attendance.\nSuperintendent Dr.\nDerek Simmons said that as a person who \"cannot draw a stick figure well,\" he is continually amazed at the artistic ability of students and what they are learning in art classes.\nSimmons said all the finalists' artwork was worthy of representing the district; however, Smith's card really stood out because of the intricate details, in particular noting the footsteps leading from the snowman to the cabin. Board members also commented on details such as the smoke rising from the chimney and the script in the trees.\nAll finalist entries may be viewed on the CCPS Flickr page, flickr.com/photos/142694579@N05/albums/. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF CCPS\n\n Colonel Richardson High School student Summer Smith, third from left, displays her certificate for creating the winning design of Caroline County Public Schools' holiday card. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Kids made ice cream cones or enjoyed hot chocolate with their parents.\nThe children were happy to get a bag of Christmas items to take home. All of them were gifted with a \"Nice List Certification\" directly from the desk of Santa Claus.\nInfants received a bag with the new logo of the Kent County Infants and Toddlers program: a giraffe. Each bag came with the book, \"The Giraffe Who Found Its Spots,\" by Adisan Books, and a plush giraffe to nuzzle over the holidays.\nParents and friends interacted with professionals in the field over pizza, cookies and tiny juice boxes.\nElizabeth Tussing the Family Resource Center's parent coordinator and organizer said, \"This year we have Santa, and it's good because kids can receive individualized time with him. It's not a long line so they don't feel the pressure.\" Also in attendance were staff from all three Judy Centers in Kent County: Rock Hall, Chestertown and the newest, Galena.\nProfessionals from the Family Resource Center and Special Education Citizens Advisory Committee, (SECAC) were there, helping with the event and being a positive presence.\nFor those in the community interested, SECAC meets on the fourth Wednesday of each month at the Kent County Middle School.\nOn Jan. 24, starting at 5 p.m, Parents Place of Maryland will teach on the transition process for student's Individualized Educational Plans. \n \n Caption: WILL BONTRAGER\n\n Dad and mom, Michael and Aimee Boumiea cheer on their sons Benjamin as he creates his Christmas cookie and Emmett (not pictured).\n\n WILL BONTRAGER\n\n Supervisor of Special Education Wendy Keen and Coordinator of Special Education Erica Costa-Gooding match Emmett Boumiea's cheerful smile.\n\n WILL BONTRAGER\n\n Everybody can gather around Santa, even adults, especially dedicated ones like these educational professionals.

Dumenil said.\n\"Caring for others is a great way to show good character.\"\nSchulte is the son of Kent Island High School art teacher and the Queen Anne's County Teacher of the Year for 2023, Andrea Schulte, and Brendan Schulte, coach and Health and Fitness for Life teacher, also at Kent Island High School.\nHe is a member of the school's Unified baseball and weightlifting activities.\nDumenil said Schulte began showing caring at an early age, starting when he was a student at Matapeake Elementary School.\nHe would routinely organize coat drives in the fall for the Knights of Columbus and peanut butter and jelly and cereal drives to support summer backpack programs. Additionally, he helps and supports serving 1,200 meals the day before Thanksgiving.\nAccording to Jone Taylor of Queen Anne's County Social Services, Schulte, who had known Taylor through being on a baseball team with her son, reached out to her in 2019.\nHe was concerned for foster children who came into care of the Department of Social Services.\n\"He started putting together duffel bags filled with special items to help a child feel a little more at ease, and give them hope that they are safe, and someone cares for them,\" said Taylor.\nThe bags were packed with items such as a blanket, a book, a night light, toothbrush and other toiletries, as well as a stuffed animal.\n\"Gavin didn't just throw things together at random. He took the time to make bags for children of all ages, and made sure to mark them by age and gender,\" Taylor said.\nTaylor said Schulte asked her a lot of questions, wanting to understand what happens when a child comes into care.\nShe believed he understood that sometimes a caseworker has to bring a child or children to safety in the middle of the night.\n\"Being able to quickly grab a bag for the child helps ease a little of the anxiety they might be feeling,\" said Taylor.\n\"Gavin took the time to listen to what was needed.\"\nSchulte even provided diaper bags filled with items for newborns with a variety of diaper sizes and gender neutral items, including receiving blankets, a bottle, pacifiers, wipes, diapers and diaper cream.\nSchulte builds an Amazon Wish List and purchases items with his own money if necessary.\nTaylor said Schulte checks in with her every four to five months to see what the department is running low on, or if they have other needs.\n\"Last year we talked about children needing socks,\" said Taylor. \"A few days later, he dropped off bags with over 40 pairs of brand new socks of various sizes and colors.\"\nTaylor said she was impressed with this young man and appreciates the heart he has for helping others.\n\"Gavin has truly been a blessing to children in need in Queen Anne's County,\" she said. \"He never looks for accolades or praise, but when I think of someone who is the epitome of selfless giving, that would be Gavin.\"\nCommissioner Dumenil agreed. \"I know this young man,\" he said. \"He is such a great kid.\" \n \n Caption: Kent Island High School junior Gavin Schulte receives the Character Counts Spotlight award from the Queen Anne's County Commissioners this month. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Student published before graduation\n\n January 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 5A | Section: News \n \n 710\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Washington College junior Natalie Martinaitis has published her first book, \"The Post-PSO Project\".The novella takes readers to the far reaches of space, in a world where psychological experiments on children have been carried out simultaneously on Earth and Mars by the People Stimulus Organization (PSO).\nThe story follows Amelia, one of 10 children invited to join Capt. Karen McCall's mission to the Red Planet to explore outside the PSO site by attending Camp Red Sands, where they will build a model of the planet's surface.\nAmelia seeks to discover what lies outside the camp's perimeter.\nBut what lies beyond could end them all.\nPublished by World Castle Publishing, the book has been available since Dec. 11 as a paperback and Kindle eBook.\n\"The Post-PSO Project\" resulted from a novella writing class project at Washington College.\n\"I loved that I could write a book for a class,\" Martinaitis said. \"It was certainly challenging to get in 10 pages a week.\" The story takes place in a world Martinaitis crafted for two previous, much longer works, both of which have yet to find a publisher. Martinaitis first came up with the idea of the PSO world when a friend showed her a Pinterest post that read something along the lines of \"what if humanity had to judge each other after watching these movies: 'The Silence of the Lambs,' 'The Sixth Sense,' 'Titanic?'\" Contemplating that thought led her to draft a play which, she states quite frankly, she hated. However, she fell in love with one of the characters she had created, named Elliot Green - a gentle, passionate and kind soul, traumatized by forced experiments conducted by the PSO.\n\"I decided to write Elliot a book of his own, which I titled 'Elliot's Story.' It reached 800 pages,\" Martinaitis said.\nCalling it her magnum opus, she submitted the tome to more than 15 literary agents and was rejected every time. Undeterred and still inspired, she soon began another novel in the same world, about the antagonist from the first, Martin Woods. That book, \"Demons,\" is nearly finished.\n\"I thought these would be the only books within the world of PSO,\" Martinaitis said. \"But it turned out I was wrong. I had two dreams which featured the Mars landscape, and I knew they would have to become stories.\" Thus, The Post-PSO Project was born.\nHailing from nearby Columbia, Maryland, Martinaitis has been plugging away at making her dream of becoming a published author a reality, while also working to obtain her bachelor's degree and serving as the editor-in-chief of the Washington College Review.\nWhile most authors do not succeed in publishing a work until well into their 30s, Martinaitis shows no signs of slowing down in her success.\nShe's aiming to win the coveted Washington College Sophie Kerr Prize next year, the largest undergraduate literary award in the country.\nWhen asked about her plans after graduation, Martinaitis said she dreams of being a full-time writer.\n\"Natalie is a serious student in the best sense - she has a serious hunger for knowledge, a serious enthusiasm for conversation with her fellow students and a serious commitment for improving her writing and engagement with literature,\" said Washington College Department of English Chair Courtney Rydel.\nThat seriousness has paid off, and Martinaitis gives credit to the workshops and classes she has taken at Washington College and to Roy Kesey, associate director for the Washington College Rose O'Neill Literary House and lecturer in English and creative writing, for assisting with editing the novella and giving pointers on how to write a query letter to publishers.\nNow Martinaitis is turning her eyes to what's next for the literary world she has created.\n\"I hope that my books 'Elliot's Story' and 'Demons' will find their forever homes,\" she said. \"However, I also have interest in the editing world, so I may first begin in children's and YA editing.\" The College has a long history of literary excellence and has molded and promoted countless new and emerging writers, editors, and publishers.\nOn campus, Washington College's Rose O'Neill Literary House offers literary-minded students programming across disciplines, professional mentorship, guidance, and spaces to study and to hold class.

    "content": "Problems persist in juvenile services schooling\n\n January 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Steph Quinn; Capital News Service | Page: 10 | Section: News \n \n 569\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n SABILLASVILLE - The graduate's mom, peers and teachers knew he was going to reach his goal, though his principal, Todd Rasher, said the other students incarcerated at the Victor Cullen Center in rural northern Frederick County didn't see \"all the footwork\" it took to earn his GED.\"This diploma ain't really too much because I knew that I was going to get it,\" the 17-year-old said to his graduation audience on Oct. 18, wearing a cap and gown, kente stole and black wristband adorned with, \"Don't give up.\" The graduate, whose identity CNS is shielding because he is a minor, was charged as an adult before his case was transferred to juvenile court.\nRasher said he passed the tests necessary to earn his GED on the first try, inspiring his fellow students to take the tests themselves.\nNot all incarcerated young people are able to continue their education, much less attain a degree. Two years after the Maryland General Assembly transferred responsibility for incarcerated students' education from the state Education Department to an independent school board within the Juvenile Services Department, students confined in Maryland's secure youth facilities continue to face multiple long-standing challenges, according to experts and state audit reports.\nTeacher vacancy rates of 30% in the most populous Juvenile Services schools have led to reliance on streaming instruction in subjects such as math and science.\nDavid Domenici, director of education and senior adviser to the Juvenile Services secretary, said streaming instruction is \"not ideal\" for the \"vast majority\" of students but better than packets of photocopied activities.\nJuvenile Services teacher vacancies have persisted through tensions between Maryland's education and Juvenile Services agencies over the past decade about who bears responsibility for educating incarcerated young people and how best to do so. Those vacancies continue through teachers' lack of summer and winter breaks and low pay relative to teachers employed by local school districts.\nBills seeking pay parity and summer breaks for juvenile services teachers failed in 2016, 2019 and 2020, often pitting experts from Education and Juvenile Services against each other. The General Assembly established a statewide education board within Juvenile Services in 2021 in response to monitors' and advocacy groups' repeated findings of high staff turnover and vacancies, inadequate services for learning disabled students and a lack of support for students returning to community schools.\nBut the law did not require pay parity or align facilities' teaching calendar more closely with local schools.\nBut lost instructional time is greatest due to a lack of residential advisers, according to audits of Juvenile Services schools by the state Office of the Inspector General.\nDepartmental policy requires that residential staff escort students from their living units to classrooms while maintaining a minimum staff-to-youth ratio. When there aren't enough residential staff, students don't move.\nStudents were late to class 203 times across Juvenile Services facilities due to residential staff shortages between April and June alone, according to the audits. Teachers had to teach class inside the living units 43 times in the 90-day inspection period.\nGetting students in the classroom, even if they are late, Domenici said, is better than class on the living units.\nThe department is working toward a goal of 90% on-time attendance in school by shifting all onsite adults to escort students to school, he said. \n \n Caption: DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE SERVICES/ERIC SOLOMON\n\n Principal Todd Rasher congratulates a graduate at the Victor Cullen Center, a youth committed placement center run by Maryland's Juvenile Services Department in Sabillasville, on Oct. 18, 2023. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Radcliffe Creek School awarded 'social-emotional' learning grant\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Local News \n \n 534\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Radcliffe Creek School (RCS) was recently awarded a grant from the Queen Anne's County Mental Health Committee (QACMHC) to expand its social-emotional learning curriculum. The new funding will broaden the robust curriculum already in place for younger students, bringing social-emotional resources to older students and their parents, as well as to the local community.Social-emotional skills serve as a guide for people to understand social situations and relationships: these abilities are central to navigating the world successfully in everyday life. Debbie Cohee-Wright, a special education learning specialist at RCS explained, \"If a child has a mental health issue of any kind, such as trauma, depression or anxiety, their ability to learn and access information is compromised. For a student to be available for learning, they must first feel emotionally safe. Making connections with teachers and peers and building trust with others must happen before the focus on academics can take place.\"\nCurrently, the school's social-emotional learning program encompasses two curriculums targeted to younger students who are identified as needing support to strengthen these skills. The program, administered by Intervention Transition Skills Coach Bryn Ponti, utilizes fun, engaging activities that integrate kid- friendly themes: kids imagine themselves as detectives who look for clues in their environment or as superheroes who earn superpowers, all while learning about executive functioning, perspective taking and self-regulation.\nHead of School Peter Thayer said, \"At RCS, we always try to meet students where they are in their learning, and here, that includes their social-emotional wellbeing. This grant from QACMHC will make a considerable difference in the lives of our older students and their families, many of whom are neurodivergent and need extra support in this area.\"\nThe funding provided by QACMHC will bring two additional curriculums\u2014Brain Talk and Conscious Discipline\u2014to the school, expanding its social-emotional programming to older students and their families.\nBrain Talk is a curriculum designed to teach students about the different areas of their brains, educating children about their executive function capabilities and how they impact responses to situations.\nConscious Discipline is a course designed for teachers, parents and guardians, providing adults with tools to show children better ways to self-regulate and build resilience.\n\"These grants are made possible by community support of our fundraisers and through generous donations from local businesses and individuals,\" QACMHC President Kelly Phipps said. \"We appreciate the outpouring of support whenever we have a fundraiser or ask for donations.\"\nIn addition to the new resources this grant will provide to Radcliffe Creek School's teachers, students and their families, the QACMHC grant will allow RCS to bring social-emotional programming to the local community as well. Planning is already underway to host an event for the public, bringing this important topic to local parents, teachers and residents in 2024. \"We are so grateful to QACMHC for their support of our school's social-emotional learning program. These funds will directly impact our students' mental health by supporting children both in the classroom and at home, leading to a more positive school environment, a greater sense of empowerment among our teachers and parents, and an increased sense of confidence in our children. We are excited to bring these resources to the Radcliffe Creek School community and beyond in 2024,\" remarked Director of Advancement Carolyn Thompson. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Diving Deep' with dyslexia: Local special education teacher works to raise awareness\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TAMARA FORTE Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 1217\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE \u2014 What do Robin Williams, Jay Leno, Albert Einstein, Alexander Graham Bell, Magic Johnson, Jennifer Aniston, Gwen Stefani, Abraham Lincoln, and Arnold Schwarzenegger all have in common? They all have dyslexia.Lindsey Parte, a mother of two boys and Special Education teacher, has reignited the Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter that fizzled out during the Covid pandemic.\nParte shares that she has been \"diving deep into advocating and teaching herself (about dyslexia)\" for the last three years.\nWhen Parte's older son, Lincoln, was six years old, he struggled with both speech and reading. Parte said a red flag to her son's learning struggle was \"knowing how smart he was but not understanding why reading was so hard.\"\nParte explains that her two-year younger son was making gains on her older son. In contrast, reading was coming with ease to her younger son.\nOn the first day of second grade, Lincoln (her older son) came home and said, \"I can't do this. I can't read. I hate school.\" Lincoln was frustrated with learning and wanted to quit.\nIt was heartbreaking for Parte as a mother and as a special education teacher herself as no one wants to see their child struggle, especially with learning. Parte explained, reading is the gateway to learning and lifelong success, and as such, learning to read successfully is vital to all.\nTwo years after Parte first suspected Lincoln was dyslexic, Lincoln got his formal diagnosis. Parte explained that getting the diagnosis meant freedom for her and her son.\nShe recounts, \"I will never forget the utter sigh of relief when we told him he has dyslexia. It all made sense to him from that moment on. Within a week, he was already talking about it in class and advocating for himself. And most importantly, we got our boy back. His light turned back on.\"\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, dyslexia is \"a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). Also called a reading disability, dyslexia is a result of individual differences in areas of the brain that process language.\"\nAn MRI shows the physical differences in the brain composition of a dyslexic thinker versus a non-dyslexic thinker. Dyslexia is so common that one in five people are a dyslexic learners.\nWhat is it like to have dyslexia? How can I help and support a dyslexic learner? What are the early indicators of dyslexia? These questions and many others will be answered at 6:30 p.m., Feb. 20, at the \"Experience Dyslexia: A Dyslexia Simulation\" workshop at the Queen Anne's County Library Kent Island Branch location.\nThe free event, hosted by Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter, aims to raise dyslexia awareness, empower families to support their children, encourage educational interventions, and ultimately influence policy makers to support Maryland students with dyslexia.\nAll are welcome. The event will offer six stations to help understand the dyslexic learner: Learn to Read, Listen to Me, Write with Mirrors, Name the Letter, Write or Left, and Unfair Hearing Test.\nParte says,\"The two biggest takeaways I have learned over the last year of my deep dive into my son's brain and the way he learns are early identification is crucial (as young as five-years-old); and the dyslexic brain requires instruction to be explicit, systematic, cumulative and multisensory.\n\"It should integrate the teaching of listening, speaking, reading, spelling, vocabulary, fluency, handwriting and written expression. There should be an emphasis on the structure of language: phonology, orthography, morphology, syntax and semantics. Training teachers and educating parents is also of the utmost importance,\" she continued.\nSince then, Lincoln has helped his mom set up and lead workshops. In October, to celebrate Dyslexia Awareness Month, this mother and son duo led the Halloween-themed workshop entitled \"There is nothing scarier than not being able to read.\"\nParte believes in dyslexia awareness and education with her whole being, which is why she fundraised, on her own, to purchase the upcoming workshop materials.\nAfter more than three years of advocating, Parte promotes all adults to learn as much as they can by listening to podcasts, attending free trainings, reading books and fact sheets, and much more.\nMoving forward, what steps can we take?\n\"Release the stigma. Embrace the label,\" Parte said. \"The label means freedom. It gives a child the right to read. The right to appropriate instruction which in turns means success in reading and regaining self confidence. We got our child back the moment we told him he had dyslexia. The label opens a world of resources for your child to feel good about themselves. Priority is a child's mental and social wellbeing.\"\nDyslexic Learners have many strengths and show a lot of leadership skills. Some other positive skills of dyslexic learners include: problem-solving, big picture thinking, creativity, empathetic, and entrepreneurial skills.\nParte shared things parents can do to help their struggling reader if they suspect their child has dyslexia:\nTesting is everything. You will be surprised how relieved your child is with a \"diagnosis\".\nFinding the right intervention specialist (tutors in reading are not the same as someone trained and certified in structured reading interventions like Orton Gillingham). Tutoring at least three times a week is most effective. The key to remediation is \"go as fast as you can and as slow as you need to\". Early intervention is crucial especially to maintain your child's confidence in school.\nDeep dive in your own research. It will help with advocacy, ensuring the right assessments are being used, and knowing the right questions to vet organizations and other folks who claim to want to help your student.\nRead to your child not so they learn to read but so that they develop their reading comprehension and vocabulary while they are learning to read with appropriate interventions.\nIf your child receives the diagnosis of dyslexia, tell them, she encourages. Share all the amazing qualities a dyslexic thinker has and famous people who have dyslexia. Show them a photograph of a dyslexic brain vs typical brain.\nKnowledge and support in this process are so important. You don't have to go through this emotional journey alone. Connect with your local Decoding Dyslexia chapter.\nParte explains, \"Most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an important role.\nThough there's no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention result in the best outcome. Sometimes dyslexia goes undiagnosed for years and isn't recognized until adulthood, but it's never too late to seek help.\"\nCommunity support, awareness, education, and training will help all our learners learn in the best ways to be successful, happy learners. Together, we can impact our future and the future of our children. If you cannot attend the workshop at the library but are interested in gaining resources and learning more, you can email decodingdyslexiaES@gmail.com for more information and for a Welcome Newsletter with a list of more resources.\nCurrently, Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter is a grassroots movement (not a nonprofit), which means it has no funding and is paid for all out-of-pocket. It is run by parents who are also working professionals.\n\"The fight continues,\" Parte said, \"Until every single child (and their families) don't have to go through this hell and back to learn how to read.\"\nTo support and make a donation to Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter, you can also email Parte at the email above. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some of his doppelg\u00e4ngers even brought their own fake metal detectors \u2014 a hobby of Bailey's.\nAfter eight years teaching at DCTC, Bailey is hanging up his trowel and picking up his metal detector.\n\"You know, I love metal detecting, so I'll probably go find the Holy Grail or something,\" he said about what he will do in his retirement.\nWhen Bailey came in for his last day of teaching, right before winter break began, it took a little while for him to figure out what his coworkers had done.\n\"I'm like, 'Wait a minute, something don't look right,'\" he said. \"Then, when I saw the metal detectors, I was like, 'Ohh, they got me good!'\"\nDCTC Principal Ashley Robinson came up with the idea.\n\"I was just trying to really think about how we could celebrate his time here in a way that he would enjoy and that he would feel appreciated,\" she said. \"So I really thought the best way to do that would be with humor, since that's something he really enjoys.\"\nIn order to keep it a surprise, Robinson said she made it a part of the school's holiday spirit week.\n\"So he thought everyone was just dressing in comfy sweatshirts,\" she said. \"And I let everyone else know we were really just dressing like Mr. Bailey.\"\nBailey, who was surprised by his coworkers' plan, thought it was funny.\n\"It was so great because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said. \"I would have never expected that.\"\nBailey said he knew Robinson had something to do with it.\n\"She comes up with such cool stuff,\" he said, adding that she gave him a plaque with a trowel on it to commemorate his time teaching at DCTC.\nHe said there's a reason he would wear the similar outfit that his coworkers knew so well to work everyday.\n\"Working in the masonry, you can't really go in there with real good clothes on,\" he said. \"You gotta wear your oldest stuff. Like, inside my car, all you see is dust.\"\nRobinson said Bailey, like the rest of DCTC's staff members, epitomizes the importance of CTE education.\n\"The majority of the teachers here have worked in industry in their field, they have those life experiences and then they chose to come back and give back and work with kids to set them up to be successful,\" she said. \"We were happy to have (Bailey) and happy that he was able to do this.\"\nBailey has had a few different careers over the years. He owned a masonry business, was a prison guard and spent four years in the Marine Corps. But teaching is in Bailey's blood. His father taught at James M. Bennett High School in Salisbury.\n\"He was football coach, track coach,\" Bailey said. \"And we lived right across the street from Bennett, so I was at school every day. I knew it from top to bottom.\"\nHe has memories of cigarette smoke \"flying out of the teachers' lounge\" and teachers coming over to his family's house to play cards with his father.\n\"I mean, that was the good old days,\" he said.\nLooking toward his retirement, Bailey has plans to further explore the hobby his DCTC coworkers know he loves.\nBailey said the Career and Technology Center staff knew about his metal detecting because he would send them photos of some of his finds.\nOver the last five years, Bailey said he has gotten more and more into metal detecting. His neighbors, known as The Hoover Boys on YouTube, post metal detecting videos. They have over 100,000 YouTube subscribers. When they moved next door, Bailey said they started giving him their hand-me-downs.\nOver the years, Bailey has found all sorts of things \u2014 from shoe buckle frames to Civil War bullets to cannonballs. Two of his major finds were a rare George Washington inaugural button and a pine tree shilling.\nAlthough he has plans to do more detecting, Bailey said he'll miss his students.\n\"A lot of them played sports, and I'd hook them up with a sub,\" he said. \"It was always a sub, a red Gatorade, orange Doritos.\"\nAs he moves on to his next chapter, Bailey now has fond memories of his own teaching experience to look back on.\n\"Oh I loved it,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Some thoughts on those New Year's resolutions\n\n January 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 607\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n An enduring annual tradition for me (and I assume for many others) at the start of a new calendar year is making New Year's resolutions.Another annual enduring tradition for me (and I assume for many others) is that sometime during the new year, often sooner rather than later, any hopes of accomplishing New Year's resolutions are abandoned.\nWhen that that happens to me, I tell myself, \"Well\u2026 maybe next year.\" I do that without acknowledging the same outcome will certainly reoccur without doing something new and different.\nThis year, my top New Year's resolution is to use new and different approaches to convert more resolutions into accomplishments.\nThe approaches in order of importance and execution are:\nEmbrace a sense of urgency.\nDevelop SMART goals.\nDevelop and execute tactics to achieve SMART goals.\nDocument all SMART goals and tactics in writing.\nReview goal progress regularly.\nRegarding embracing a sense of urgency, Professor John Kotter has written, \"The single most crucial factor in achieving permanent and meaningful change is a continuous sense of urgency. A true sense of urgency occurs when people acknowledge action on critical issues is needed now, not eventually, not when it fits easily into a schedule. Now means making real progress every single day. Urgent behavior is not driven by a belief that all is well or that everything is a mess but, instead, that the world contains great opportunities and great hazards.\"\nRegarding SMART goals, they are to be specific, measurable, audacious, realistic and time sensitive. On the matter of audacious goals, Peter F. Drucker has written \"There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.\"\nIn other words, go big on your goals or go home.\nRegarding developing and executing tactics to achieve SMART goals, tactics are the necessary next steps in priority order to achieve each SMART goal. Professor Gail Matthews has written that the following questions need to be considered:\nWhat exact actions do I need to do to achieve my goals and in what order?\nWhat resources do I need?\nWho can help me achieve my goals?\nWhat at potential problems should I anticipate?\nHow can I address them?\nRegarding goal progress tracking, Professor Matthews has also written that \"76 percent of those who wrote down their goals, took actions on them and reviewed weekly progress reports achieved their goals. This result is 33 percent higher than those participants with unwritten goals.\"\nRegarding written records components, the following components are essential:\ngoal categories, e.g., health, family, personal growth, professional growth, and career. Other essential critical written components in addition to a list of SMART goals are tactics, due dates, current status reports and notes.\nFor best results, custom design your New Year's resolution game plan. The exact number of goal categories, SMART goals, tactics and projected due dates are for you to decide based on where you are and where you want to be on your life journey. All can be kept privately or be shared confidentially with a trusted and supportive coach.\nSome concluding thoughts on success with New Year's resolutions:\nWe live in a VUCA world, a world characterized by high levels of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. Despite planning, commitment and hard work, some New Year's resolutions may still not be achieved in one year. That is not a reason to abandon them. SMART goals can and always be rolled forward into a following year.\nHappy New Year and all the best on success with your resolutions for 2024 and in the years ahead.\nDavid Reel is a consultant who provides counsel and services on strategy, advocacy and media on public affairs issues.

    "content": "Superintendent of schools to retire in 2024\n\n January 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 987\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROCK HALL \u2014 Superintendent of Kent County Public Schools, Dr. Karen Couch will be retiring at the end of the current school year, effective June 30. The announcement came at this month's Board of Education meeting. Board President Joe Goetz and Vice President Francoise Sullivan were re-elected to their positions during the Jan. 8 meeting as well.Couch said it has been an honor to collaborate with the exceptional team of administrators, teachers, staff and board members.\n\"Our collective commitment to the students and families of this county has been profound,\" Couch said. \"Throughout my tenure, we achieved significant milestones, a testament to our collective dedication to excellence in education. This commitment consistently drove us to adapt and innovate, ensuring our students receive the best education possible.\"\nUpon the delivery of Couch's announcement, Goetz, described the meeting as a \"heavy night\" with the weight of the superintendent's decision in the air.\n\"But you're not gone,\" Goetz told Dr. Couch. \"And we'll have time to celebrate and we'll have time to reflect on where we've been and where we're going.\"\nGoetz said everyone is a link in the chain driving KCPS, with many having come before them and more to follow. He said they will all do the best they can to continue providing students with a top-quality education.\n\"Working with you has been an absolute joy,\" Goetz said to Couch. \"There's been a lot of ups and downs, but we'll celebrate all that as we move forward.\"\nAs a first step in the KCPS leadership transition, the Board of Education is holding a special meeting at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 23 to discuss the search for the next superintendent. The meeting will be held at the KCPS Administrative Building, 5608 Boundary Ave., Rock Hall.\nCouch is retiring in the back half of her third four-year term as the superintendent of KCPS. Her most recent contract renewal was approved in the spring of 2021 for four years.\nShe first came on board at KCPS on July 1, 2013, having led a candidate field of nearly 20 applicants.\nCouch was named the Maryland Superintendent of the Year in 2021. She made her mark on KCPS early, launching a technological revolution by bringing computers and smartboards into classrooms, greatly expanding teachers' and students' access to educational resources.\nShe built a collaborative environment in schools through fostering professional learning communities, which brought teachers together to share best practices to help reach all students.\nShe also made KCPS one of the first school systems in Maryland to adopt universal all-day prekindergarten, giving children an important head start on their education. \"Amidst numerous budgetary challenges, including declining enrollment and limited resources,\nwe remained committed to prioritizing organizational improvements and addressing the diverse needs of our students and staff,\" Couch said.\nShe improved the school buildings themselves through targeted renovations, enhanced safety features like security vestibules and launching the planning process for a new middle school.\n\"During my tenure, we also executed a comprehensive six-year Facilities Strategic Plan,\nrevitalizing educational facilities untouched for over 25 years,\" she said. \"Moreover, we successfully fulfilled preliminary state requirements for the construction of a new middle school while advocating for legislation to increase state funding participation for the project.\"\nSullivan, praised Couch's professionalism in the face of myriad challenges including tight budgets, declining student enrollment and the COVID pandemic. \"You have helped our schools accomplish so much in the time that you've been here and it hasn't been easy,\" Sullivan told Couch. \"You have always been professional and represented our schools really well, and I can only imagine how tough that probably was for some things.\"\nHailing from New Mexico, Dr. Couch previously served from 2001 to 2013 as the superintendent of the Moriarty-Edgewood School District, about an hour east of Albuquerque. In 2010, she was honored as the New Mexico Superintendent of the Year.\nCouch moved to Kent County with a reputation for having turned that rural school district into one of the top-achieving in the state through a focus of continuous school improvement and the incorporation of research-based education programming.\nShe has likewise implemented similar strategies at KCPS, increasing the visibility and participation in the Career and Technical Education (CTE) program at Kent County High School, encouraging the growth of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs and training elementary school teachers in the renowned Orton-Gillingham method of English language arts instruction.\nTrish McGee, the longest serving among the current Board of Education members, was first elected the year after Couch's hiring. McGee covered the search process that saw Dr. Couch come onboard as the associate editor of the Kent County News.\nSpeaking at the Jan. 8 Board meeting, McGee said Couch paid out of her own pocket for travel from New Mexico to Kent County for one of her first interview visits. McGee said that showed just how prepared Couch was willing to go the distance to address the challenges faced by KCPS.\n\"I think every decision she ever made personally and professionally was really about how to move our school district forward,\" McGee said. \"And I can't think of a greater legacy than something like that.\"\nCouch's tenure at KCPS caps off a career in education that began in 1980 when she became a kindergarten teacher in the Las Cruces Public Schools in southern New Mexico. She was then employed by the Alamogordo Public Schools and rose through the ranks in that district from teacher to principal and, ultimately associate superintendent.\nAlong the way, she earned her master's degree and later received her doctorate in educational administration from New Mexico State University.\nCouch said she is confident that KCPS will continue to nurture and inspire every child who walks through its doors and she eagerly anticipates hearing all those future success stories.\n\"As I begin a new chapter, I know that our work has laid a strong foundation for continued student success,\" Couch said. \"The legacy of our efforts is not in the programs we've started or the facilities we've renovated, but in the lives of the students we've touched.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Blueprint pillar chairs share Caroline's progress\n\n January 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: Local News \n \n 1301\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 At the Jan. 9 meeting of the Caroline County Board of Education, several supervisors provided updates on progress towards meeting requirements of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a set of policies and dedicated funding seeking to transform several aspects of the state's public education system by 2026.Assistant Superintendent Dr. Tara Downes said the district has been receiving additional guidance from the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) and Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB) since spring 2023.\nAs a result, required tasks have been \"chunked out\" over a more manageable timeline, and the pillar chairs are \"actually ahead of schedule\" with some aspects of the plan.\n\"The pillar chairs have been phenomenal in being proactive when it comes to the work,\" Downes said.\nAccording to its website, \"The Blueprint for Maryland's Future was passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 to transform public education in the state into a world-class education system. The Blueprint will increase education funding by $3.8 billion each year over the next 10 years, enrich student experiences and accelerate student outcomes, as well as improve the quality of education for all children in Maryland, especially those who have been historically underserved.\"\n\"The Blueprint really involves everything that we're doing on a daily basis,\" said Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons.\nAccording to the Blueprint website, \"The bold work of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future is organized into five distinct pillars.\" Each pillar has a set of objectives to help administrators and educators align instruction and community support to them and determine needed resources.\nPillar 1: Early Childhood Education\nThe main focus of Pillar 1 is the expansion of pre-kindergarten for three-year-olds and four-year-olds, said CCPS Supervisor of Instruction Elizabeth Saylor, who serves as Pillar 1 chair.\nOf the 375 pre-K students enrolled as of Sept. 30, 58 are in pre-K three and 317 are in pre-K four. The main focus currently are Tier One families who are \"up to 300% of the federal poverty level, or 319 students. As of Jan. 9, 395 students were enrolled in pre-K,\" Saylor said.\nA challenge is the need for private daycare providers, who must follow Blueprint's criteria. Providing more qualified and more certified staff is another challenge both for Pillar 1 compliance and workforce development, an objective of Pillar 2.\n\"Making sure families and students are ready for kindergarten\" is ultimately the focus of the pillar, Saylor said.\nPillar 2: High Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders\nCCPS Supervisor of Human Resources Dr. Rob Willoughby addressed four objectives of Pillar 2, which focuses on the recruitment of high quality and diverse teachers and leaders.\nChesapeake College has been \"a fantastic partner with us through the Maryland Leads\" grant initiative, he said. The district recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Mount St. Mary's University, which offers a fully online bachelor's degree in elementary education.\nWilloughby's group is looking at other ways of providing staff and enhancing qualifications, including encouraging National Board Certified Teacher credentialing.\nForty-eight teachers are currently in the process of pursuing that certification. \"That is 10% of our teaching staff pursuing a really rigorous national certification,\" he said.\nA Pillar 2 challenge includes a starting teacher salary of $60,000 by Blueprint's July 1, 2026, deadline.\n\"Our starting teacher salary this year $53,167, and \u2026 we're about $6,800 to the end,\" Willoughby said. \"If you divide that over the three fiscal years we have, that means it needs to go up at least $2,278 (per year).\"\nPillar 3: College and Career Readiness\nBlueprint's third pillar focuses on students' college and career readiness.\nCollege and Career Readiness Director Lindsey McCormick explained the progress being made towards complying with Pillar 3 of the Blueprint as the district works under interim standards. Students are assessed at the end of their 10th grade year and can choose a career pathway. The district offers 16 Career and Technology Education (CTE) pathways.\nIn addition to pursuing a college track and taking advanced placement courses, students can receive career counseling. Students in AP courses are now required to sit for the exams in the spring; the tests are paid for by the district.\n\"I am very pleased to say that this year through our MOU with the (Upper Shore) Workforce Investment Board, we have added one high school and one middle school career coach that are in the buildings five days a week working with students,\" McCormick said.\nShe said the district is growing the youth apprenticeship program and modeling it for businesses.\nIf students are not college and career ready, the district is working on a pilot program to provide supports, including online study, to help them meet state standards, McCormick said. Chesapeake College supplied data from the past three years that showed students' learning online was just as successful as classroom learning.\nPillar 4: More Resources to Ensure that All Students are Successful\nPillar 4 of Blueprint seeks to provide students with more resources that could help them succeed.\nSupervisor of Instruction Christal Harkowa, one of the co-chairs for Pillar 4, updated the school board on multilingual learners.\nThe district has hired two multilingual learner family coordinators to work with Spanish- and Haitian Creole-speaking constituents.\n\"We have really been able to improve our communication with our families,\" Harkowa said. \"They are very dedicated; they stay after (school), they attend all kinds of after school events, parent conferences when we need them for 504 or IEP (Individualized Education Program) meetings to make sure our parents understand what the needs of their students are and to be able to advocate and ask questions.\"\nShe said her goal by the end of this school year is to \"identify MLL families for parent leadership opportunities.\"\nTo support MLLs in instruction and language acquisition, the district is providing ongoing professional development for teachers and instructional assistants while \"being respectful of their planning time,\" Harkowa said. Another focus is helping students develop English proficiency in elementary school.\nSupervisor of Special Education Erica McDonald discussed the objective of closing the achievement gap for students with disabilities.\nThe leadership team created a mission statement at the beginning of the current school year, provided Goalbook toolkit training and additional training to help teachers and co-teachers meet objectives and monitor \"disproportionate identification and disciplinary practices.\"\n\"Our special education teacher specialists have really taken on the role of educational diagnosticians,\" she said.\nA Blueprint objective is to \"establish or enhance Community Schools in areas of concentrated poverty.\" Three CCPS schools \u2014 Federalsbury Elementary, Greensboro Elementary and Colonel Richardson Middle School \u2014 meet the criteria and have district coordinators assigned to them.\nSupervisor of Student Services Nicole Fisher reported the Pillar 4 team is committed to evidence-based practices, but challenges facing the district are providing adequate behavioral health staffing and transportation.\nSimmons said \"As Blueprint ratchets up, all nine of our schools are going to qualify for Concentration of Poverty funding due to the FARMS (Free and Reduced-Price Meals) rates in all of our schools \u2026 in about another two or three years.\"\nPillar 5: Governance and Accountability\n\"Pillar 5 is what pulls together all of the other pillars,\" Simmons said, explaining that the pillar focuses on governance and accountability.\nTwo main areas of focus are the \"stakeholder engagement plan\" and Blueprint funding and resources which require \"money following the students.\"\n\"Pillars 1 through 4 have done an incredible job of reaching out to community members, and they've got strong, robust teams that are getting lots of feedback,\" Simmons said, elaborating on the stakeholder engagement objective.\n\"There are shifts \u2014 monumental shifts in some areas \u2014 for the way that we're doing (Blueprint),\" he said. \"But eventually we'll stop talking about Blueprint, and we'll just be talking about what it is that we're doing that connects to the strategic plan, because the overlap will be there when it's closer to full implementation.\"\nThe complete report is linked in the Jan. 9 meeting agenda, where you can also watch the complete school board meeting at carolineschools.new.swagit.com/videos/294177\nThe MSDE Blueprint Implementation Plan is available at bit.ly/BlueprintPlanMSDE. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Moore says budget will balance, protect school funding\n\n January 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KIERSTEN HACKER Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 930\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Gov. Wes Moore unveiled a budget proposal on Wednesday that would balance the books and protect the state's ambitious reform plan for Maryland public schools, without raising taxes in the fiscal year that begins in July.The $63.1 billion plan would balance the books where officials had projected a shortfall, in part by returning some programs to spending levels closer to those of the pre-pandemic era. The plan proposes leveraging state debt and dipping into rainy day funds.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's sweeping education plan of 2021, will be fully funded, state budget officials said Wednesday. Moore, a Democrat, said his administration crafted the budget plan in partnership with lawmakers, community leaders and other \"village elders.\"\n\"We wanted to make sure that this proposed budget had everyone's fingerprints on it,\" Moore said in his public announcement of the new plan. \"Because this budget is not just a reflection of an administration. This budget is a reflection of our shared aspiration.\"\nThose aspirations will now go to the Maryland General Assembly for debate. Lawmakers have set a target of early April for passing a budget, and the state Constitution requires that it be balanced.\nBut the joint Republican Caucus will look closely at where funding transfers in the proposed budget are coming from, House Minority Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany, told Capital News Service.\nWhile he said he is pleased that the Moore administration kept total spending similar to that of years past, he expressed concerns about the possibility of fees for certain businesses or tax hikes down the road. Buckel said he'll keep worrying about that possibility until the legislature adjourns.\n\"All in all, it's a mixed bag, I think, and we'll look forward to working with the governor and working with the Democratic leadership here to try to make the budget as good as possible,\" Buckel said.\nSenate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey suggested he worries about the possibility of fee increases down the road.\n\"While it is a relief that the governor's budget spends less than last year and does not raise taxes, the number of fee increases proposed by his administration through legislation and the regulatory process is concerning,\" said Hershey, a Republican representing Kent, Cecil, Queen Anne's and Caroline, in an email release. He and other Republicans contend fee hikes are coming through the administrative pipeline.\n\"Taxes aren't the only way to raise revenue,\" Hershey said, \"and state government should not be in the business of nickel and diming Maryland's families and small businesses.\"\nThe only fee increases currently in the budget plan are in the Department of the Environment, and those would generate roughly $3.5 million in revenue, according to a spokesman for the governor's office.\nWorking together to approve a balanced budget had been shaping up as no easy task. The state's spending had been projected to outpace revenues starting in the coming fiscal year, according to a recent report from the Department of Legislative Services.\nBut Moore has now proposed a plan that would instead balance the 2025 budget, saying it is a step in the right direction toward addressing the state's structural deficit in the years beyond that.\nHis budget flips the expected cash shortfall of $1.1 billion to a positive cash balance of $103 million in fiscal 2025, according to Helene Grady, Maryland's secretary of budget and management.\nMoore said his budget prioritizes public safety, affordable housing, child care, education and public service. It also raises pay for state employees.\n\"We know that budgets, they're moral documents,\" Moore said. \"Where we choose to invest actually defines our values. And it dictates the course of our future.\"\nState budget officials said they avoided wide-ranging cuts across the board, hiring freezes or salary freezes. Rather, state agency heads went through an intense process and found areas to trim, and several agency budgets will be lower this year than they were the year before.\nMoore said he proposed a record $127 million for local police agencies, citing the importance of supporting law enforcement and getting \"more boots on the ground\" to solve crimes and keep repeat offenders off the streets. Other investments would go toward the prevention of gun violence and support for crime victims.\nWhile addressing public safety, Moore acknowledged the debates about juvenile justice likely to come during the legislative session, announcing an increase in funding to the Department of Juvenile Services. He didn't specifically discuss any cuts made to juvenile services programs.\nAffordable housing and child care would receive significant funding under the proposal. Those are two areas Moore claimed are the biggest strains on Maryland residents. Access to housing and child care allow for increased participation in the workforce as Maryland tries to grow its economy, he argued.\n\"Access to child care doesn't just affect your child and your family,\" Moore said. \"It changes the trajectory of our state's fiscal health.\"\nOptions for job training in innovative industries and public service were a priority. Through Moore's budget, the state is on track to increase the number of Service Year Option and Maryland Corps participants to 500, as required by law.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future will be fully funded in the coming fiscal year, budget officials said, but its money problems are far from resolved. Prior to the beginning of the legislative session, the Department of Legislative Services report projected the state would exhaust the Blueprint balance in fiscal 2027.\n\"It's not inaccurate to say, 'Hey, we funded the Blueprint, or at least the state's portion of the Blueprint, for today,'\" Buckel said. \"But I also think it's completely honest to say the blueprint looming large over the next four or five years, blows billion-dollar holes into our state budget.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Board of Education discusses proposed budget, Blueprint's affects\n\n January 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 621\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 At a Talbot County Board of Education meeting Wednesday, Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi and Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones went over the proposed fiscal year 2025 budget.At the beginning of their presentation, Pepukayi shared the Board of Education and superintendent priorities. These priorities are to improve economic equity and achievement in math; foster an engaging environment for students and staff; recruit, promote and retain staff and meet the the Blueprint for Maryland's Future objectives.\nThe Blueprint is a plan, passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021, that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state through increasing education funding by $3.8 billion each year over the next 10 years.\nTalbot County Public Schools' current draft fiscal year 2025 budget is $80.03 million. According to the presentation, the proposed budget is $7.98 million more than that of the fiscal year prior.\nAfter Pepukayi spoke, Jones listed where those increases to the budget come from. These include the addition of 16 positions and money set aside to achieve a $60,000 starting salary for teachers by fiscal year 2027, a Blueprint requirement aimed at attracting and retaining high quality and diverse teachers.\nThe district's budget increase in technology devices and software costs is due to the expiration of COVID-19-related grants. Jones said a significant amount of annual technology costs had come out of grant money over the past few years.\n\"Those grants are expiring,\" she said. \"So that translates to an increase in our request for FY25.\"\nAnother reason for the budget increase is the district's community school initiatives for next year.\nAccording to the Maryland State Department of Education, community schools work with community partners, local governments and other stakeholders \"to identify and address structural and institutional barriers to achievement.\" These schools receive Concentration of Poverty Grants, which give schools startup funding and per-pupil dollars to sustain them.\nJones said Easton Middle School will be coming on as a new community school and that Easton Elementary School is in its third year as a community school. She said the cost increases for these initiatives are mainly payroll related.\nJones said there are two potential reductions that could be made to the proposed budget that would save about $259,000 \"without impacting student learning.\"\nThe first possible reduction would be to bring down the budget line for dual enrollment. Jones said the district realized, after getting the bill from Chesapeake College, that it had overestimated costs \u2014 particularly for instruction materials.\nThe second possible reduction would be to pay over time for a new school bus the district intends to buy, rather than paying for the bus in full.\nAfter the presentation, Board President Emily Jackson asked if it was possible for the district to quantify how much of that $7.98 million increase directly applies to the Blueprint.\n\"I want to make sure we are telling our story in a way that is effective to the people who have to go and approve the budget and understand why we are asking for this much more money,\" she said.\nJones said Jackson's ask is a challenge because the Blueprint is \"so embedded in what we're doing\" that it's hard to differentiate which costs are tied to the Blueprint and which aren't. But, she said that, of the 16 new positions, she could say which were specifically tied to the Blueprint.\nBoard Vice President Candace Henry said past cuts to the budget could speak to the Blueprint's affect on the proposed fiscal year 2025 budget.\n\"We could speak to things that we've had to cut out of previous years, and now \u2014 because of Blueprint \u2014 we have to have,\" she said. \"So I think we can use some of that information to tell that story to the public as well.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So, we are approaching a high, which is where we want to be.\"\nCommissioner Frank Bartz asked about maintaining support services salaries, something that he said is not addressed in the Blueprint.\n\"A lot of people in the county work for support services,\" he said. \"I just want to make sure that they're taken care of.\"\n\"You're spot on,\" Simmons said. \"The Blueprint addresses teachers only and leaves out two-thirds of our workgroup, and (it) does not take into consideration any support staff or administration. Required increases to salaries are \u2026 for the most part, to classroom-based teachers with kids on the workload.\"\nSimmons said the Supportive Services Association is a negotiated employee group.\n\"Their contract was ratified to be closed from 2012 until next year, so that has been a closed contract with a required 1% in step every year, and then it's 1% in addition to whatever the teachers get. Their contract comes open next year for us to negotiate.\"\nSimmons said the \"biggest challenge that we're going to see this year\" is the Blueprint formula's increase of 1.7% over last year's budget \"when inflation is currently still running over 3%, and that factors in no increases in health insurance, which is probably 5% to 7% right now, we're hearing.\"\nThat percentage does not factor in any pay increase. Blueprint requires first-year classroom teachers to be earning $60,000 by fiscal year 2027.\n\"After this year, the budget increases roughly 5%,\" Simmons said. \"We're sitting in a different position in our county than some of our colleagues are in others. \u2026 A lot of the larger systems are looking at significant cuts of teaching positions because (of) that 1.7% increase. It's a regressive budget no matter how you cut it, when it's only that much of an increase, and the cost of living is definitely a lot higher.\"\nWhen COVID funding and (Maryland) Leads funding \"dries up in September at the same time as we're getting a 1.7% increase, that's the perfect storm,\" Simmons said. \"And again, we'll weather it for our staff. We'll figure it out. I really, truly believe we will. It's just going to be a really tough year.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

A student who is emerging readiness has few of those foundational skills and behaviors.\nThe percent of kindergarteners demonstrating readiness went up to 39% this school year from 32% last school year. The year before that, in the 2021-2022 school year, 29% of students were demonstrating kindergarten readiness.\n\"I wish I had some confetti and a little horn to celebrate,\" Colman said about this year's results.\nAlthough the percentage of students demonstrating readiness went up this school year, so did the percentage of students emerging readiness. It was at 38% this school year compared to 30% last year.\nThe percentage of students approaching readiness decreased to 33% this school year from 38% last school year.\nThe district saw an increase in the number of its kindergarteners demonstrating readiness in language and literacy and mathematics, but it saw a decrease in its kindergarteners demonstrating readiness in social foundations and physical well-being and motor development.\n\"I do think that speaks to the level of need for some of our students in the younger grades and the mental health supports that they need, the social development that they need,\" Colman said. \"Those are our COVID babies and I think that kind of hit us here.\"\nSTAR RATINGS\nColman also presented on the different star ratings for each school in the district. Star ratings are given by the state and determined by different academic and school quality indicators.\nAccording to Colman's presentation, every school except for Vienna Elementary School kept it's star rating from the year before. Vienna Elementary went down from four stars in the 2021-2022 school year to three stars in the 2022-2023 school year.\nColman said three DCPS schools that were less than one percentage point away from gaining another star. Those schools were Mace's Lane Middle School, Sandy Hill Elementary School and North Dorchester Middle School. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Student writes graphic novel about Frederick Douglass\n\n January 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 466\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 A recent graduate of Washington College, Andrea C. Proimos spent her final semesters at school creating a web-based graphic novel about traveling in the footsteps of Frederick Douglass.This novel, aimed at young adults, is a playful and curious take on a serious subject. The author wrote it in conjunction with her thesis while completing her bachelor's degree in English.\nIn it, there are mixed photographs, fine art, cartoons and mixed media together.\nAfter receiving a $3,000 Sophie Kerr Promise Grant, Proimos and her dog, Zelda, traveled from Easton's farm fields, to the city of Baltimore, to Douglass' gravesite in Rochester, New York. It was travel in search of the famed abolitionist's life story.\n\"This book follows his actual narrative from when Douglass was born to when he escaped to freedom. This tells his biographical story,\" Promios said about her graphic novel, which she wrote with information gleaned from her travels.\nShe marvels at his place in history and her own.\n\"I wonder how many spots Zelda and I stood exactly where Douglass had stood. Each place we went uncovered new information and new stories about Douglass and the early formation of American history. We were able to immerse ourselves in the scenery and make new discoveries through museums, national forest exhibits, books, murals and all kinds of unexpected representations.\"\nThe writer said that she moved to Easton while completing her studies and found herself living right next to history.\n\"When I moved to Easton, they were having a huge debate about a Confederate monument that was still outside of the courthouse. As the community was having this debate, a mural was painted by Michael Rosato. His was the first mural to go up. As I was finishing my thesis statement, Adam Himhoff's mural went up. I was kind of living in the middle of Douglass history that was still going on,\" she said.\nShe said she wrote her thesis on the multi-dimensional nature of Douglas. The book \"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass\" strikes her as more than just a book and was the spine of her paper.\n\"I explored a lot of representations, like statues and graphic representations, because that was important to his image as he was the most photographed man of the 19th century. He was way ahead of his time. He was like the American dream of the underdog,\" she said.\nThe graphic novel contains lots of photographs of primary historical sites and whimsical drawings by Proimos.\n\"I can read the graphic novel with my 9-year-old. She is not going to get everything. It is meant to go with the 'Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass.' But there are cartoony elements in there that are fun and light hearted. It shows you that Frederick Douglass is a relatable person,\" she said.\nTo read her graphic novel, go to: frederickdouglasseaston.blogspot.com \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eastern Shore Delegation to ask governor for Cade formula restoration\n\n January 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: General Assembly \n \n 482\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 At a meeting Friday, the Eastern Shore Delegation voted to send a letter to the governor's office asking that the Cade Funding Formula for community colleges be restored in a supplemental budget.Gov. Wes Moore's proposed fiscal year 2025 budget calls for the reduction of $22 million in Cade formula funding to community colleges in the state.\nThe Cade formula essentially ties state funding for community colleges to state funding for designated University System of Maryland institutions, according to the Maryland Association of Community Colleges.\nMoore's proposal would reduce the Cade formula from 29% to 26.5%.\nThat percentage \u2014 the amount of funding community colleges receive from the state \u2014 is based on the funding given to public four-year institutions per full-time equivalent student.\nAt the Eastern Shore Delegation meeting, legislators were joined by the presidents of colleges that are located on the Eastern Shore, as well as MACC Executive Director Brad Phillips.\nPhillips called rebasing the Cade formula a \"budget word\" for inequity.\n\"Look at it this way,\" he said. \"If you're giving a student a dollar to go to a University System of Maryland or a four-year public institution, the policy goal is that 29 cents goes to community colleges. ... (with the reduction,) you're cutting community colleges out. You're still providing a dollar to our four-year friends.\"\nWor-Wic Community College President Deborah Casey told the delegation she had spent hours preparing a budget with an 11% cut.\n\"That's $1.5 million for Wor-Wic Community College,\" she said of the budget cut. \"That doesn't work for us.\"\nCasey said that she can't build infrastructure and carry Wor-Wic in the best direction with a budget reduction of this magnitude.\n\"And you're expecting and asking us, and holding us accountable to making sure we're meeting many needs of this community,\" she said. \"Please help us get that full funding.\"\nPhillips said Maryland's community colleges are up 8.3% in enrollment this year.\n\"So this is a cut that would actually stretch less funding to more students,\" he said.\nDuring the meeting, both Casey and Chesapeake College President Cliff Coppersmith mentioned increases in enrollment at their schools.\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) said this increased enrollment is one reason why this formula change is concerning.\nDel. Jefferson Ghrist (R-36, Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline), who made the motion to send the letter, said the Maryland Department of Legislative Services had given the House Appropriations Committee, which he is a member of, a list of possible cuts that could be made in order to restore the Cade formula to 29%.\n\"There's a lot of places that we can go to find money to restore that,\" he said.\nGhrist said getting the Cade formula restored in a supplemental budget, however, would make the job of the House Appropriations Committee easier.\n\"That way it'll be done before we start really getting down to work on the budget,\" he said. \"That would make our jobs a heck of a lot easier on the committee.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Jennifer Stanley steps down from Oxford Kids Camp\n\n February 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 642\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD \u2014 Jennifer Stanley, the founder of the Oxford Kids Camp, is stepping out of the leadership role after more than 40 years.She leaves behind a legacy of bicycles, sail boats, swimming in the Bay and discovering frogs in the mud.\nThrough the lens of running a kids camp, this president and director has seen many changes in Oxford.\n\"I moved here when we bought our house in 1979. If I was a kid, this place would be like a playground to me \u2014 all the water you wanted, and access to do all kinds of fun things on the water, and all this rural, beautiful countryside. But I didn't see any kids,\" said Stanley.\nShe found a group of kids sitting on the steps of the Community Center. Parks and Recreation had the kids playing board games under the porch. She came back to find them in the afternoon, but they were all gone. They had left out of boredom.\n\"Oxford has fewer families with children living in it (now). The original camp really did serve the community. Families living here, grandparents and children of people who worked here. We had plenty of children then. We have had to open to a larger community. It changes the dynamics a lot. There was that spirit that you got there on your own and got home on your own,\" she said.\nThe camp served 50 kids a week and grew to 250 for the summer. Biking and nature gave way to swimming lessons and canoeing.\n\"That was the idea. Let's do a summer program. We approached the Community Center, who was beginning. I approached them and they said, 'We would love you to use the Community Center, but you have to be independent of us,' which was a good decision on their part. It forced us to think about what kind of an organization we wanted to be,\" Stanley said.\nStanley, who had previously run education programs with kids at the South Street Seaport in New York City, worked at American Youth Hostels leading bike trips. She had traveled abroad with kids in Canada, Europe and South America.\nOxford Kids Camp came to life in 1982. It has a board and is a nonprofit organization.\n\"The community really embraced us. Here we were riding around town and people were cautious. If it was a through, it would be different, but we are a dead end, a peninsula. It was ideal,\" she said.\nElizabeth Wainright, who taught at New York's prestigious grade school for boys, Buckley, has been part of the camp since she was a girl.\nWainright has been named as Stanley's replacement at the kids camp.\n\"Elizabeth was a camper at age five. I can still visualize her. She laughed so hard at the bad boys. She was also a trickster. At one of our campouts, we woke up to toilet paper all over. If I can dream about the perfect person, she would be it. She will keep me in the loop. We haven't figured that out yet, but I am thrilled to be turning over the reins,\" Stanley said.\nWainright said, \"Both OKC (Oxford Kids Camp) and Miss Jenny had given me experiences as a camper, counselor and co-director that have been among my favorite and most formative. It is hard to imagine camp without Jenny at the helm. She will still be involved significantly, but I am honored to take the tiller for the next leg of the course.\"\nLooking back at what really worked, Stanley said, \"The biking was really popular. It was freedom, and even through you are in a line, you are going places that they don't usually get to go to. They love it. There is a lot of laughs and silliness in camp. They knew they were welcome. They could be free and they were free to play hard.\"\nFor more information about Oxford Kids Camp, visit oxfordkidscamp.org/. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Jennifer Stanley steps down from Oxford Kids Camp\n\n February 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 642\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD \u2014 Jennifer Stanley, the founder of the Oxford Kids Camp, is stepping out of the leadership role after more than 40 years.She leaves behind a legacy of bicycles, sail boats, swimming in the Bay and discovering frogs in the mud.\nThrough the lens of running a kids camp, this president and director has seen many changes in Oxford.\n\"I moved here when we bought our house in 1979. If I was a kid, this place would be like a playground to me \u2014 all the water you wanted, and access to do all kinds of fun things on the water, and all this rural, beautiful countryside. But I didn't see any kids,\" said Stanley.\nShe found a group of kids sitting on the steps of the Community Center. Parks and Recreation had the kids playing board games under the porch. She came back to find them in the afternoon, but they were all gone. They had left out of boredom.\n\"Oxford has fewer families with children living in it (now). The original camp really did serve the community. Families living here, grandparents and children of people who worked here. We had plenty of children then. We have had to open to a larger community. It changes the dynamics a lot. There was that spirit that you got there on your own and got home on your own,\" she said.\nThe camp served 50 kids a week and grew to 250 for the summer. Biking and nature gave way to swimming lessons and canoeing.\n\"That was the idea. Let's do a summer program. We approached the Community Center, who was beginning. I approached them and they said, 'We would love you to use the Community Center, but you have to be independent of us,' which was a good decision on their part. It forced us to think about what kind of an organization we wanted to be,\" Stanley said.\nStanley, who had previously run education programs with kids at the South Street Seaport in New York City, worked at American Youth Hostels leading bike trips. She had traveled abroad with kids in Canada, Europe and South America.\nOxford Kids Camp came to life in 1982. It has a board and is a nonprofit organization.\n\"The community really embraced us. Here we were riding around town and people were cautious. If it was a through, it would be different, but we are a dead end, a peninsula. It was ideal,\" she said.\nElizabeth Wainwright, who taught at New York's prestigious grade school for boys, Buckley, has been part of the camp since she was a girl.\nWainwright has been named as Stanley's replacement at the kids camp.\n\"Elizabeth was a camper at age five. I can still visualize her. She laughed so hard at the bad boys. She was also a trickster. At one of our campouts, we woke up to toilet paper all over. If I can dream about the perfect person, she would be it. She will keep me in the loop. We haven't figured that out yet, but I am thrilled to be turning over the reins,\" Stanley said.\nWainwright said, \"Both OKC (Oxford Kids Camp) and Miss Jenny had given me experiences as a camper, counselor and co-director that have been among my favorite and most formative. It is hard to imagine camp without Jenny at the helm. She will still be involved significantly, but I am honored to take the tiller for the next leg of the course.\"\nLooking back at what really worked, Stanley said, \"The biking was really popular. It was freedom, and even through you are in a line, you are going places that they don't usually get to go to. They love it. There is a lot of laughs and silliness in camp. They knew they were welcome. They could be free and they were free to play hard.\"\nFor more information about Oxford Kids Camp, visit oxfordkidscamp.org/. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Sense of urgency needed on school absenteeism\n\n February 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 634\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Representatives from the Maryland State Department of Education, Maryland Association of Boards of Education and Public School Superintendents' Association of Maryland met recently with members of the Ways and Means Committee in the Maryland House of Delegates.At that meeting, all three advocacy groups expressed their support for fully funding the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, also known as the Kirwan Report.\nAlong with the Blueprint for Maryland's Future there is another issue that has had and will have a significant impact on public education in Maryland.\nThat issue is chronic absenteeism.\nThe Maryland Department of Education defines chronic absenteeism as missing more than 20 days in a school year, no matter the reason.\nWYPR, the public broadcasting corporation's flagship radio station in Baltimore, recently introduced a news report on this issue with the following lead in:\n\"Chronic absenteeism 'real concern' Maryland lawmakers and educators aim to address.\"\nWYPR cited Maryland Board of Education data indicating that over one-third of Maryland K-12 students missed 10% or more school days last year, with 54.1% of Baltimore City students and 34.7% of Baltimore County students hitting that mark.\nThe consequences of chronic absenteeism are serious and long lasting.\nMaryland Board of Education President Clarence Crawford has observed that \"chronic absenteeism can adversely impact a child for a lifetime.\" He noted research has shown that \"chronic absenteeism impacts test scores, grades and children's ability to be able to graduate.\" He also noted \"chronic absenteeism increases the likelihood of engagement with the criminal justice system.\"\nEspecially disheartening in the Maryland Board of Education data that nearly 35% of children in kindergarten statewide are chronically absent.\nSue Fothergill, a senior fellow at Attendance Works (a national nonprofit dedicated to raising awareness about the negative impacts of absenteeism), says: \"In early grades, some of our families think, 'Well, it's just kindergarten, or it's just first grade, children can miss a few days here and there, it's not that big of a deal.' The reality though, is that those are the most important formative years, not just for learning to read, but learning social emotional skills and establishing habits that help those young people throughout their careers. When a child is chronically absent in kindergarten, they are less likely to be proficient in reading by third grade as at that point, teachers often switch to content-focused learning. It becomes much harder to catch a child up and be able to learn how to read as they matriculate through their years, because they've missed those formative years.\"\nGov. Wes Moore and state lawmakers are aware of and have already demonstrated a level of concern and action on this problem.\nAt a recent \"Improving Student Achievement\" event in Washington, D.C., Moore said, \"We know that there are real obstacles we still have to address.\"\nIn the Statehouse and the state Senate, legislation has been introduced to establish a task force to study chronic absenteeism in Maryland's public schools.\nThe legislation as introduced, requires the task force to report its findings and recommendations to the governor and General Assembly by Dec. 1.\nGoing forward, local and state funding levels for the Blueprint for Maryland's Future will continue to generate enormous amounts of dialogue and deliberation at local governments throughout Maryland and in the General Assembly. That is to be expected as the Blueprint is a multi-year initiative that mandates a projected $3.8 billion increase above current levels of local and state funding for public education in Maryland.\nA critical element of success in public education requires more than mandated increases of local and state funding.\nIt requires more than awareness of, concern about, and discussions on the issue of chronic absenteeism.\nWhat is needed is a sense of urgency on action to address chronic absenteeism in every public school in Maryland.\nDavid Reel is a consultant who provides counsel and services on strategy, advocacy and media on public affairs issues. He lives in Easton. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "House GOP introduces bill to repeal Biden college plan\n\n February 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MATHEW SCHUMER Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 549\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON \u2014 The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has advanced a Republican-sponsored bill that includes measures repealing key aspects of the Biden administration's plans to make college more affordable.The College Cost Reduction Act, introduced by the panel's chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-North Carolina), passed on a party-line 22-19 vote.\nThe measure presents numerous programs intended to strengthen the integrity of higher education institutions across the country, but also would gut much of President Joe Biden's efforts to help students afford college. Democrats on the committee offered a series of amendments to the bill aimed at blocking the GOP repeals, but all were defeated.\n\"Unfortunately, President Biden has decided time and time again that the executive branch should also hold the legislative pen,\" Foxx said, \"Congress has the task of creating laws that reflect the interests of the people. It is not the role of the executive pen.\"\nLast August, the Biden administration launched the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) program, aiming to cancel debt to borrowers who originally owed $12,000 or less in loans and had repaid at least ten years of those loans.\nThe program is slated to begin in February, with 6.9 million Americans already enrolled, according to the White House.\nBiden's original plan, as laid out in his 2022 executive order to cancel up to $430 billion in student loans, was blocked by the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision last June. The court determined that the secretary of education lacked the power to issue debt relief on the scale described in the administration's plan.\nLast September, Foxx introduced a resolution with Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Michigan, to nullify the SAVE plan, but the full House never voted on it.\nFoxx's College Cost Reduction Act, introduced in January, would establish a streamlined data system to convey information about colleges, create a performance-based grant program, and hold academic institutions responsible for unpaid student loans.\nIn the committee meeting to consider the bill, Democrats introduced 30 amendments to alter some fundamental aspects of the legislation.\nRep. Bobby Scott (D-Virginia) praised parts of Foxx's bill, \"such as codifying Postsecondary Student Success Grants and eliminating interest capitalization and origination fees on student loans,\" but the panel's ranking Democrat objected to some provisions that he said would make it harder for people to go to college.\nRep. Kathy Manning (D-Michigan) offered an amendment to strike language from the bill repealing Biden administration regulations to protect student borrowers during changes in ownership of academic institutions.\nAnother Biden administration regulation the Foxx bill aims to repeal is the 90-10 rule, which requires for-profit universities to secure at least 10 percent of their funding from non-federal sources. Rep. Mark Takano (D-California) introduced an amendment to strike this section from the final bill but was rebuffed by the GOP majority.\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) offered a motion to remove the bill's rescission of Biden's SAVE plan, but that motion was defeated.\n\"The new (SAVE) program created by the Biden administration\u2026 creates a generous IDR (income-driven repayment) plan that Republicans now want to strip away,\" Omar said.\nRep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Michigan) unsuccessfully tried to amend the bill with language streamlining the process of finding on-campus accommodations for students with disabilities.\nBonamici's proposal is part of a group of bills unveiled Monday by Democratic members of the education panel referred to collectively as the Roadmap to College Student Success. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What are you doing buddy? What's up pal?\" Jeff Simmons welcomes everyone with his energetic and contagious excitement.\nIt's 7:30 a.m. on a Tuesday morning. School won't begin for more than an hour. What brings middle schoolers, teachers and community members out early before school?\nFor some students in Queen Anne and Talbot Counties, it's a new club called Fellowship of Christian Athletes. This club, or huddle, welcomes not only athletes but anyone who wants to come and make a difference.\nAlthough FCA may be new to some local schools, it is well-known around the world. For over 60 years, FCA has had one mission \u2014 \"unite your two passions, faith and athletics, to impact the world for Jesus Christ.\"\nFounder Don McClanen started FCA after reading that 30 million American youth had no religious training. McClanen began posting his articles in the locker room and praying before games. Soon, he was dreaming of a way for well-known Christian athletes to advertise their faith on television and in magazines the way they advertised other household products. Currently, FCA is in 115 countries with over 20,000 huddle meetings occurring around the world.\nAt their first huddle, Centreville Middle students spent time together in fellowship.\nThe \"Walk Out Faith'' huddle activity included scripture readings, a memory verse and relevant questions asking teens how they can grow their faith while also building the community around them.\nSeventh Grade Social Studies teacher Thomas Hayman helps oversee the FCA huddle with other school staff. A former church youth director and a current Queen Anne's County Public Schools Teacher of the Year finalist, Hayman is dedicated to teaching and investing in his students. His loyalty doesn't go unnoticed, Hayman's students said he's told them he would even \"take a bullet\" to keep them safe.\nHayman said it was fate that allowed him to meet Simmons, a former CMS tutor, at the school and fate that put him in this position. Hayman said he is looking forward to the fellowship afforded by FCA \"to get together, have fun and see what kind of positive change we can make.\"\nSimmons is the area director of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes) for Queen Anne's and Talbot counties.\nHe said he had not heard of FCA until a friend suggested he look into it. After research and attending some huddle meetings, he said he was \"blown away by what they were doing, how they were doing it, and the impact it had.\nIn his new position, Simmons has to annually raise his entire budget. The success here is directly linked to the local community's involvement, Simmons said.\nWith all the huddles happening, there were still many middle and high schools in both Queen Anne's and Talbot counties that had no FCA presence and did not have the same opportunities.\nIn this monthly email update, Simmons wrote, \"There are 9 schools (middle and high) between both counties that do not have any sort of FCA on their campuses.\"\nWith the generous support of the community, the 2024 FCA budget for Queen Anne's and Talbot counties was fully funded.\n\"Thanks to God's provision, coming in the form of generous one time donations and support from those who signed on as Monthly Partners, we reached the amount needed to support the program's budget for 2024\" Simmons said.\n\"In order to establish FCA programming in the remaining schools, we need to fully fund our FCA budget with recurring donations,\" Simmons shared. \"Securing our annual budget with recurring monthly support will allow us to start planning for the future of FCA on the Eastern Shore. This will allow us to not only provide resources and support to the huddles that are already up and running, but also to establish a FCA presence in the schools without one currently.\"\n\"Your support, whether it be in financial contributions, prayer and encouragement,\" Simmons continued, \"has confirmed this community's commitment to see Jesus glorified and lives changed through this ministry, and I am so grateful that we all get to be part of it. God is working on the Shore through these coaches, students, and leaders and I know that the best is yet to come!\"\nIf you would like more information or would like to volunteer, email Jeff Simmons at jsimmons@fca.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This is a nearly $7.9 million increase from fiscal year 2024.\nTCPS Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said that while this seems like a larger increase than recent years, the increase is meant to offset a decrease in federal funding.\n\"This unrestricted budget coupled with the decrease in all of our federal programs nets to a 3.4% increase,\" she said.\nThis means that the district is asking for a total of 3.4% more money than it received for fiscal year 2024.\nTCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the district is losing $4.8 million in grant funding for fiscal year 2025.\nTCPS Director of Communications Debbie Gardner said in an interview that the $4.8 million came from two COVID-19 related grants \u2014 the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund and the Maryland Leads grant.\nThe proposed capital budget for fiscal year 2025 is $12.1 million. Capital requests include the renovation and expansion of Chapel District Elementary School, the installation of a turf field at Easton High School, the replacement of auditorium lights at Easton High School, the installation of a basketball court at Easton Elementary School, an update to the stadium lighting at Easton High School and a playground replacement at St. Michaels Elementary School.\nNext month, the proposed budget will be presented to the County Council. A public budget hearing, held by the County Council, is set for May.\nBoard President Emily Jackson thanked TCPS staff for \"the huge lift\" of preparing the budget.\n\"Go forth and get this passed,\" she said. \"You can do it.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, she said the interim standard will also remain in effect until July 1, 2025.\nThe interim standard states that students can be considered college and career ready if they achieve certain scores on either the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, the early fall MCAP or the spring MCAP for both English 10 and either Algebra I, Algebra II or Geometry.\nAnother update Einhorn gave at the meeting is that the district has hired Sharon Gaskins as a strategic facilitator to support the district's efforts with the Blueprint.\n\"(Gaskins) has over 25 years in education and really has been a change agent working with organizations to ensure that they meet their goals,\" Einhorn said.\nEinhorn said the district was able hire Gaskins using grant funding through the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board.\nEinhorn also gave an update on a report that the district will need to submit to the Accountability and Implementation Board and MSDE by March 15.\nThe report will detail the district's implementation of the Blueprint so far. Einhorn said this includes discussing any challenges the district might be facing with implementation.\nThis report is a way for the state to monitor that school districts are \"able to transform\" through reshaping and adapting new polices and practices that create a more equitable system, Einhorn said.\n\"I'm here tonight to assure you that we will meet that March 15 deadline,\" she said. \"And I look forward to sharing some of the findings in that report.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Corporate tax breaks end up costing schools\n\n February 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: THE CONVERSATION | Section: National \n \n 1063\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Built in 1910, James Elementary is a three-story brick school in Kansas City, Missouri's historic Northeast neighborhood, with a bright blue front door framed by a sand-colored stone arch adorned with a gargoyle.As bustling students and teachers negotiate a maze of gray stairs with worn wooden handrails, Marjorie Mayes, the school's principal, escorts a visitor across uneven blue tile floors on the ground floor to a classroom with exposed brick walls and pipes. Bubbling paint mars some walls, evidence of the water leaks spreading inside the aging building.\n\"It's living history,\" said Mayes during a mid-September tour of the building. \"Not the kind of living history we want.\"\nThe district would like to tackle the $400 million in deferred maintenance needed to create a 21st century learning environment at its 35 schools \u2014 including James Elementary \u2014 but it can't. It doesn't have the money.\nPROPERTY TAX REDIRECT\nThe lack of funds is a direct result of the property tax breaks that Kansas City lavishes on companies and developers that do business there. The program is supposed to bring in new jobs and business but instead has ended up draining civic coffers and starving schools. Between 2017 and 2023, the Kansas City school district lost $237.3 million through tax abatements.\nKansas City is hardly an anomaly. An estimated 95% of U.S. cities provide economic development tax incentives to woo corporate investors. The upshot is that billions have been diverted from large urban school districts and from a growing number of small suburban and rural districts. The impact is seen in districts as diverse as Chicago and Cleveland, Hillsboro, Oregon, and Storey County, Nevada.\nThe result? A 2021 review of 2,498 financial statements from school districts across 27 states revealed that, in 2019 alone, at least $2.4 billion was diverted to fund tax incentives. Yet that substantial figure still downplays the magnitude of the problem, because three-quarters of the 10,370 districts analyzed did not provide any information on tax abatement agreements.\nTax abatement programs have long been controversial, pitting states and communities against one another in beggar-thy-neighbor contests. Their economic value is also, at best, unclear: Studies show most companies would have made the same location decision without taxpayer subsidies. Meanwhile, schools make up the largest cost item in these communities, meaning they suffer most when companies are granted breaks in property taxes.\nA three-month investigation by The Conversation and three scholars with expertise in economic development, tax laws and education policy shows that the cash drain from these programs is not equally shared by schools in the same communities. At the local level, tax abatements and exemptions often come at the cost of critical funding for school districts that students from low-income households and who are racial minorities.\nIn Missouri, for example, in 2022 nearly $1,700 per student was redirected from Kansas City public and charter schools, while between $500 and $900 was redirected from wealthier, whiter Northland schools on the north side of the river in Kansas City and in the suburbs beyond. Other studies have found similar demographic trends elsewhere, including New York state, South Carolina and Columbus, Ohio.\nThe funding gaps produced by abated money often force schools to delay needed maintenance, increase class sizes, lay off teachers and support staff and even close outright. Schools also struggle to update or replace outdated technology, books and other educational resources. And, amid a nationwide teacher shortage, schools under financial pressures sometimes turn to inexperienced teachers who are not fully certified or rely too heavily on recruits from overseas who have been given special visa status.\nLost funding also prevents teachers and staff, who often feed, clothe and otherwise go above and beyond to help students in need, from earning a living wage. All told, tax abatements can end up harming a community's value, with constant funding shortfalls creating a cycle of decline.\nINCENTIVES AND PAYOFFS\nPerversely, some of the largest beneficiaries of tax abatements are the politicians who publicly boast of handing out the breaks despite the harm to poorer communities. Incumbent governors have used the incentives as a means of taking credit for job creation, even when the jobs were coming anyway.\n\"We know that subsidies don't work,\" said Elizabeth Marcello, a doctoral lecturer at Hunter College who studies governmental planning and policy and the interactions between state and local governments. \"But they are good political stories, and I think that's why politicians love them so much.\"\nWhile some voters may celebrate abatements, parents can recognize the disparities between school districts that are created by the tax breaks. Fairleigh Jackson pointed out that her daughter's East Baton Rouge third grade class lacks access to playground equipment.\nThe class is attending school in a temporary building while their elementary school undergoes a two-year renovation.\nThe temporary site has some grass and a cement slab where kids can play, but no playground equipment, Jackson said. And parents needed to set up an Amazon wish list to purchase basic equipment such as balls, jump ropes and chalk for students to use. The district told parents there would be no playground equipment due to a lack of funds, then promised to install equipment, Jackson said, but months later, there is none.\nJackson said it's hard to complain when other schools in the district don't even have needed security measures in place. \"When I think about playground equipment, I think that's a necessary piece of child development,\" Jackson said. \"Do we even advocate for something that should be a daily part of our kids' experience when kids' safety isn't being funded?\"\nA young student in the East Baton Rouge district told the school board that money going to tax breaks for corporations could provide better internet access or be used to hire someone to pick up the glass and barbed wire in the playground. But at least they have a playground \u2014 Hayden Crockett, a seventh grader at Sherwood Middle Academic Magnet School, noted that his sister's elementary school lacked one.\n\"If it wasn't in the budget to fund playground equipment, how can it also be in the budget to give one of the most powerful corporations in the world a tax break?\" Crockett said. \"The math just ain't mathing.\"\nThis article was written by Christine Wen, Texas A&M University; Danielle McLean, The Conversation; Kevin Welner, University of Colorado Boulder; and Nathan Jensen, The University of Texas at Austin.

    "content": "Anti-war protests, rises in antisemitism magnify challenges for free speech on college campuses\n\n February 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: National \n \n 408\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks inside Israel has birthed contentious protests on college campuses magnifying debates around free speech and how universities should handle ramped up and controversial rhetoric \u2014 including antisemitism.The debate can pitt students' and staff's free speech rights \u2014 especially at public universities \u2014 against safety and harassment concerns voiced by other students and employees.\n\"I think we forget that there is the possibility that even protected speech can create a hostile environment. I think that's important,\" said Shira Goodman, senior director of advocacy for the Anti-Defamation League, which has seen a rise in reports of antisemitism since Oct. 7.\nGoodman said protests and events on campus can potentially run afoul of Title VI of the federal Civil Rights Act that protects students and others of \"shared ancestry\" and other protected classes from mistreatment and harassment at colleges and universities receiving federal financial aid and other government money.\nThe U.S. Department of Education is currently conducting Title VI shared ancestry investigations at more than 40 colleges \u2014 including Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, University of Michigan, Montana State University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of South Florida and University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nOn the other side of the issue, Haley Gluhanich, program officer for campus rights advocacy for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, has seen an increase in calls from students and others across the political spectrum about their First Amendment rights being restricted.\n\"We are seeing events being canceled. We are seeing student organizations being de-chartered. We are seeing students and faculty members getting disciplined for social media posts for some comments made in class,\" Gluhanich said.\nProtests against the war include criticism of U.S. and President Joe Biden's military and other support for Israel.\nGluhanich and Jane Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota, said even \"hate speech\" enjoys First Amendment and protections as long as it doesn't cross the line into more direct and specific threats or incites violence.\nKirtley worries about government actors (including at public universities) as well as wealthy donors discouraging speech they don't like.\nShe said that comes with peril and potential blowback.\n\"Once we open the door to allowing the government to tell us what thoughts aren't acceptable, we run the risk that, in the future, ideas with which we agree could be suppressed, as well,\" she said.\nFor a more expansive story on this issue check out StarDem.com and our e-edition on Monday, Feb. 26. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Winter break will begin Dec. 20.\nThe calendar committee emailed a link to the survey Jan. 12 to over 5,400 parents, guardians and all CCPS staff members. A reminder email was sent Jan. 22, and the survey was closed Jan. 26. Some community members provided feedback, as well.\nAlthough 75% of the 3,500 parents and guardians who responded favored a post-Labor Day start, 696 staff respondents, or 70% preferred a pre-Labor Day start.\nBefore reviewing the feedback, Simmons cautioned the school board, saying, \"No matter what decision you make, you're going to make people upset, period. There is no perfect calendar, period.\"\nBoard member and retired Caroline County teacher Donna DiGiacomo favored the earlier start.\n\"So, one calendar starts Aug 28; the other starts Sept. 3, but the end date is just one day difference,\" DiGiacomo said. The adopted calendar gets \"students in a routine quicker, and you have a shorter week when you start \u2014 you have three days, so everybody's not dead by Friday.\"\nShe said a 4-day first day of school \"doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a lot.\"\nWinter break begins with a half-day Friday, Dec. 20, and students returning to school Jan. 7.\n\"A hard shutdown over winter break for two solid weeks\" would result in reduced heating costs and \"significant savings\" during \"the hardest budget year we're going to have,\" Simmons said.\nThe post-Labor Day calendar would have had students returning Thursday, Jan. 2, 2025.\n\"This might not be a popular thing to say, but the reality is not a whole lot is going to get done on that Thursday and Friday,\" DiGiacomo said.\nOther factors influencing the pre-Labor Day start were academic quarter dates and required parent-teacher conferences, which \"we talked about ad nauseum,\" Simmons said.\nCalling the process \"wonky\" and comparing it to a game of dominoes, Simmons explained the factors that prompted the calendar committee to go through \"seven or eight drafts to get down to the two that made the most sense.\"\nFor example, the first quarter parent-teacher conference day will occur Nov. 5, even though it's election day, because the first quarter ends Nov. 8 and the conference day \"has to fall before the first report card goes out, before grades are secured,\" Simmons said.\nThe adopted calendar has four inclement weather days built in. If they are not used, they come off the calendar.\nState law, teacher contracts, mandatory conferences, state testing days, a set number of half-days, a mid-year transition day all dictate certain days off. Once all of the days off are built in, \"it becomes a game of counting to 90 twice\" to achieve a state-mandated 180-day school year, Simmons said.\nDiGiacomo recommended surveying students next year and considering staggered starts for sixth grade and ninth grade students as they change schools.\n\"The pluses of draft two are just not as many as the pluses in draft one,\" said Rick Barton, president of the school board.\nAlthough he liked \"the idea of a longer break,\" school board Vice President Mark Jones was ambivalent.\n\"I honestly don't like either one of them, really,\" he said.\nThat ambivalence was reflected in the overall survey results, with 54% of all respondents preferring a post-Labor Day start and 46% going with the pre-Labor Day calendar.\nAnticipating mixed reactions from the public and staff as well, Jones asked, \"When do we want to hear complaints? Do we want to hear them right before the first day of school, or do we want to hear them after Christmas break? I think I'd probably rather hear them at the beginning of the year and get it out of the way.\"\nTo view the 2024-2025 CCPS school year calendar, visit www.carolineschools.org/page/ccps-school-calendar.

A week later, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, the Board announced that Bromwell would be stepping down from his position, effective March 1.\nBromwell was officially appointed as superintendent in 2020 with a four year term. Before that, he served as interim superintendent for the district. In his time at DCPS, he has also served as a teacher in the district and as the principal of Cambridge-South Dorchester High School.\nAccording to the Feb. 21 statement from the Board of Education, the decision for Bromwell to step down in March was \"mutually decided\" by him and the Board. In the Feb. 16 statement, the Board expressed gratitude to Bromwell for his years of service to DCPS.\nValerie Goff, DCPS communication and community outreach specialist, said Bromwell, who was not present at the Board meeting Thursday, had no comments at this time.\nAt the meeting, Board Vice President Susan Morgan acknowledged that the district is experiencing change \"once again.\"\n\"But I do trust in our teachers, our administrators, our directors and, now, our interim superintendent, to keep us moving forward,\" she said. \"Through everything we as a Board do, we always keep in the front of our minds what's best for all the children that we serve.\"\nBoard Member Chris Wheedleton said the search for the district's next leader can't happen without \"recognizing the value of somebody who has given close to 40 years of service to the district.\"\n\"I want to thank Mr. Bromwell for his service and for what he has done,\" Wheedleton said.\nEarlier in the meeting, Milton Nagel and Bill Middleton from the Maryland Association of Boards of Education presented on what to keep in mind when conducting a superintendent search.\nNagel told the Board that although it was not their reason for attending the meeting, MABE does conduct superintendent searches for its member districts.\n\"If the Board so desires to engage in that conversation about potentially having MABE do a search, we can certainly facilitate that,\" he said.\nIn a statement released later that night, the Board said it will begin the search for a new superintendent to take office July 1.\nToward the end of his remarks at the meeting Thursday, Thompson, who is also a board member of the Talbot County Board of Education, told the public that they will get mad at him.\n\"But I want you to also understand this \u2014 and I mean this from the bottom of my heart \u2014 that I'm always going to make the best decisions that I think are right for kids,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Responsible Fathers Initiative empowers, strengthens men\n\n February 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Local News \n \n 1210\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 In late 2021, Ja'Shaun Wilson had a son on the way.At the time, Wilson, now 31, was incarcerated at the Talbot County Detention Center.\nAlready thinking ahead, he recalled wanting to try to figure out how to adapt to being a first-time father before he was released.\nThat's when he decided to participate in Inside Out Dad, a Responsible Fathers Initiative group held inside the jail.\n\"... I never really had any strong role models,\" he said. \"So I just figured, what could it hurt by taking the class?\"\nTo Wilson's surprise, the group's curriculum did more than just talk about fatherhood \u2014 it prompted him to reflect on himself more deeply and gave him the tools he needed to move forward when he reentered the community, ready to meet his son and be the role model he didn't have himself.\nRESPONSIBLE FATHERSFounded by Corey Pack in 2019, the Responsible Fathers Initiative is a local nonprofit committed to helping enlighten men to the impact fathers have on a family and better prepare them for the duties and responsibilities of fatherhood.\nThe curriculum it uses was developed by the National Fatherhood Initiative, a broader nonprofit that offers evidence-based fatherhood programs, resources, training and more in an effort to increase fathers' involvement.\nInspiration for the local initiative began when Pack was asked to help out with an existing fathers' group in the detention center in 2019.\nPack is no stranger to fatherhood programming. In the mid-2000s, he headed a group in Cambridge for several years before turning his attention to local government, serving on the Talbot County Council for 15 years.\nBut still, a \"burning desire\" to get back into it lingered, he said, and his second chance came at just the right time.\n\"I think God knew my heart. He knew this was something I really wanted to get back into doing,\" he said.\nThe data behind a father's impact on a family was a motivator for Pack.\nPack said children born in a household without a responsible father are more likely to live in poverty, suffer from abuse or neglect, drop out of school, become involved with drugs and alcohol, and be involved with the criminal justice system.\n\"...The numbers are telling us (that) when we boil it all down, between race and region and religion and culture, it comes back to the family,\" he said. \"When the family unit starts to crumble apart, then you see these other ills pop up in our society.\"\nPack started facilitating in-person groups for men in the detention center in 2019 and initiated a women's group, too, though the pandemic's arrival in 2020 hampered some progress.\nWith the help of Talbot County's IT department and the Department of Social Services, Pack pivoted into running all-virtual classes for men and women at the detention center throughout the year \u2014 a feat no other county in the state was able to do, he said.\nSince then, the initiative has grown. Now, it includes three in-person groups inside the detention center, two for men and one for women, along with two community-based men's groups and two teen dads' groups, both of which are held in Easton and Cambridge.\nThough the curriculums provided by the national initiative help with the lessons learned in groups, the Responsible Fathers Initiative leans on community partners to flesh out its offerings even more.\nThe Neighborhood Service Center in Easton, Delmarva Community Services, YMCA of the Chesapeake, the Talbot County Department of Social Services, the St. Michaels Community Center and Washington College, among others, are just some of those key partnerships.\n\"It would not work, cannot work, without the partnerships, without that synergy,\" Pack said. \"The sum is greater than its parts.\"\nHELP ON OUTSIDEThose partnerships with other community organizations and county agencies play a significant role in helping the Responsible Fathers Initiative's mission.\nThe fatherhood piece of the initiative aligned well with the Neighborhood Service Center's existing 2Gen program, which provides resources to support the whole family in an effort to increase self-sufficiency and break generational poverty cycles, said Dawn Phillips, who serves as the program's case manager and the center's Responsible Fathers Initiative coordinator.\nThe initiative's community group for fathers operates at the center's location on Port Street in Easton and provides meals and wraparound services to participants, including help with housing, transportation, food and financial literacy.\nTo Phillips, the initiative has been a \"major contribution\" in working to beat generational poverty cycles.\n\"The role of the father in the household is huge,\" she said.\nRegardless of whether fathers are living with their families, the center being able to help men with better communication, improve self-esteem and support education and employment efforts can empower participants and break the cycle.\nTo Wilson, those supports were invaluable \u2014 he received help with enrolling his son in day care and obtaining a voucher for it, he said.\nLISTENING, LEARNING, GROWINGWith multiple meetings running weekly both inside and outside of the detention center, the opportunities for group participants to grow in knowledge of themselves and the commitments and responsibilities associated with fatherhood are ample.\nThe curriculums in the detention center and in the community are similar, with focuses placed on self-awareness, self-care, fathering skills, parenting skills and relationship skills.\nTo Pack, the group serves as a supportive, judgment-free zone \u2014 a safe space where time is given to listen and be heard.\n\"... When they can come together in a group and they feel that they have some comfort there, they're being respected, they're not being judged, they're not being told that they're a deadbeat father or that they're worthless or they're not this or that, but allowed to be heard \u2014 I think that gives them the empowerment to come back,\" he said.\nWhile in the detention center, Wilson always looked forward to going to the group, he said.\nHe recalled being prompted with \"I am\" statements, which are commonly used to provide affirmations and challenge negative self-perceived thoughts.\n\"I had the basis of 'I am Black,' 'I am a man,' but it made me dig deep for the next go around,\" he said. \"I had stronger responses because it really made me think about how I view myself or wanted to view myself.\"\nBeing in the group with other men who openly shared their failures and strengths in being a father, along with how it affected them before and during their incarceration, provided a variety of viewpoints for Wilson to consider.\nHolding himself accountable, learning the ins and outs of communication, body language and tone through the initiative's curriculum proved to be some of the key lessons Wilson still remembers today. Those lessons were especially beneficial with navigating co-parenting and having respect for each other, he said.\nThat work continued when he joined the men's group held in the community, too.\nAnd although his son is just shy of 2 years old, Wilson knows he wants to be a role model \u2014 one who wants to make sure his son knows that it's OK to cry.\n\"... A lot of that is stigmatized, and I want him to know it's OK to show your emotions basically, because that's what a lot of us are taught not to do,\" he said. \"I just want to let him know that it's OK to have emotions and to show them, and the proper ways to deal with them \u2014 that's the type of stuff I'd like to instill in him.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We are a family childcare home, not a center.\"\nThey opened just last summer. But over the years, Elizabeth has taught in a variety of childcare centers, in public and private schools, and at the university level.\n\"It was important to us to develop a program that included neurodivergent children and was based on best practice and research-informed play-based learning,\" she said. \"We recognized that the most impact on learning happens in early childhood and sought to develop a program that combined community resources, learning experiences outside the classroom, and sensory-rich play.\"\nA neuro-affirming, play-based, bilingual family child care located in Betterton, they are an MSDE-approved ASPIRE Pre-K and participate in the MD EXCELS and credentialing programs. With an extensive background in special education, their passion is providing quality care to diverse learners and serving families in their community.\nBeyond the home, Kinder Connection participates in many field trips for not just the children but for the whole family.\n\"Since we have been open, we have taken children to Tuckahoe State Park hiking, the Delaware Children's Museum, the Garfield theater twice, the Galena Fire Department, the Sultana Foundation twice, Bespoke Chocolate, Talbot County Ice Rink to go ice skating, to a magic show, to library concerts and events, and to almost every park in the area,\" Elizabeth said.\nFamilies pay a set field trip/holiday fee each week, and Kinder Connection coordinates everything. They also have had a variety of guest speakers come and talk to the children.\nIn less than a year, Kinder Connection is already making plans to expand.\n\"We are planning to expand our home by adding almost 600 square feet,\" Elizabeth said. \"This will allow us the already licensed Kinder Connection to convert to a designated Large Family Childcare and separate the two classrooms from their home. The facility is currently licensed for eight children, and the addition will allow them to serve 12 children. The next step is finding funding for the addition and a large van or small bus so that will make weekly field trips easier.\"\nWith a current waiting list for future spots, children are accepted through the ASPIRE program, which provides grant funding through MSDE for free tuition for qualifying families of children ages 3 to 5. Kinder Connection also accepts Child Care Scholarships for low-income working families.\n\"We strive to have our program look like our community \u2014 we value having a variety of cultures, races, abilities, and socio-economic status represented,\" Elizabeth said.\nIn addition to school-year care, Kinder Connection runs a summer camp as well. \"We run a 6-week summer camp where we enjoy immersing ourselves in art, music, and water play and take several field trips,\" she said.\nParents William Machande and Sarah Kalb said, \"Kinder Connection has been truly extraordinary for our son's growth and development. We are so fortunate to have found Ellie and Jamie. They provide a comfortable, fun and productive environment for the children. They go above and beyond, and then some.\"\n\"I love that my three year old learns beyond the four walls of a room and spends a lot of time outside, learning in exciting and innovative ways. He's always excited to share his day,\" said Robert and Dana Smith. \"Both Ellie and Jamie have included the families on fun field trips and in holiday fun. The Christmas program was such a highlight.\"\nFor more information, visit kinderconnection.org/. There is an upcoming open house for families of children ages 1 to 5 that are interested in fall care at 6 p.m. Monday, March 11. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The space, located at 210 S. Cross Street, will host a number of rotating exhibits highlighting Washington College teaching, experiential learning, and research with opportunities for sharing, learning, and dialogue in a community space.Each exhibit will be informational, interactive, and highly visual, creating a dynamic space for learning and sharing for the Eastern Shore community.\n\"Facilitating shared knowledge and understanding to drive action for conservation and community resilience is at the core of our mission,\" said Valerie Imbruce, director of Washington College's Center for Environment and Society. \"This new off-campus space will aid us in creating opportunities for active collaboration for both teaching and learning for our Washington College community, community organizations, regional K-12 educators, students, and interested visitors. We're excited to welcome the community into this new, innovative, and collaborative space.\"\nLast fall, the Digital Scholarship in Museum Partnerships Project was the first collaborative effort featured in the Cross Street space, which hosted a collection of exhibits created by students from five museums in Kent County \u2014 Sumner Hall, The Waterman's Museum, The Worton Point Schoolhouse, Betterton Heritage Museum, and Kent Museum. With the goal of preserving and providing greater access to the local histories of our community, the exhibition highlighted the mission of the space by providing digitized looks into each museum, viewable through virtual reality with 360-degree virtual tours, digitized collections, oral history interviews, and interactive panels.\nOpening on March 1, the first exhibit in the new, updated, and enhanced space will be \"Teaching & Transformation: Semester in the Chesapeake Classroom.\" It will showcase the nature and culture of the Chesapeake Bay region through the final projects created by Washington College's Chesapeake Semester students. Their hand-drawn maps, visual journals, and other writing and visual arts will provide visitors a sense of the unique Chesapeake ecosystem, analyze solutions to environmental problems, and explore the nexus between science, policy, and people's everyday lives in the region.\n\"The Chesapeake Semester is such a unique opportunity afforded to Washington College by our location here on the historically, culturally, and ecologically rich Eastern Shore,\" said Sara Clarke-De Reza, education department chair and director of the museum, field, and community education minor. \"This exhibit showcases our students' intensive interdisciplinary study of the Chesapeake Bay, and their comparative study in watershed communities in northern Belize. The students' hope for this exhibit is that it will highlight the lessons learned through classroom and field-based experiences across the semester in a way that expands visitors' understanding of the human and social dimensions of environmental issues in our region.\"\nWhen exhibits are installed, MuSE will be open on First Fridays from 4:30-7 p.m. and on Saturdays from 8 a.m. to noon during the Chestertown Farmers Market. Requests for group showings will also be available. \"Teaching & Transformation: Semester in the Chesapeake Classroom\" will remain open through August 2024.

    "content": "Books rife with sexual content\n\n March 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 384\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When I first heard about the \"Freedom to Read\" Act, Maryland SB 0738, I was reminded of the words of one of our founders, John Adams : \"Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people, who have a right \u2026 and a desire to know; but besides this, they have a right, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge, I mean of the characters and conduct of their rulers.\" (A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law, 1765)So when I heard of the \"Freedom to Read\" Act, I wondered what banned books were suddenly going to be made available to the students of Maryland. I assumed there must be some politically controversial books from the Cold War Era that had been suppressed.\nIt was disappointing when I discovered that the books which Maryland students are being encouraged to read are rife with graphic sexual content, ones which most parents deem inappropriate for their children. Last fall, parents in Carroll County questioned why books with graphic sexual imagery were being made available to children without parental knowledge or consent.\nOne is the autobiography of Jaycee Dugard, who was kidnapped and used as a sex-slave in a cellar for years. I have read Dugard's \"A Stolen Life: A Memoir;\" it as a story of heroism but only for mature readers since it is about a kidnapping and child rape. It does not belong in a school.\nAn article in the Easton Gazette (Feb. 2, 2024) provides details about the \"banned\" books which SB 0738 is intended to liberate. To quote: \"These books have pornographic images or descriptions, the likes of which you could find in Penthouse magazine. The Carroll County Board considered the opinions of parents with children as young as elementary school who complained that these books demonstrating various types of sex such as oral, vaginal, anal, etc. were accessible to students. Some of the books portrayed graphic rape scenes or sexual experimentation in the story lines that were not appropriate for any minor child.\"\nSo when Maryland schools are struggling to achieve basic literacy, how is it helpful to have students' minds filled with images of rape, etc? Why are the wishes of parents ignored and disrespected? What is the agenda?\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nTalbot County Republican Central Committee\nClaiborne \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS \u2014 A crowd of family, politicians, civic leaders and Boy Scouts assembled in the Scout House on St. Mary's Square to present the Eagle Scout Badge to Vincent Thomas Dyer Sunday.Multiple candles were lit to commemorate different aspects of his journey that started when he was 5. This is the highest honor a Scout can achieve and only about four in 100 Scouts reach it.\nDyer's sash had 26 merit badges on it, and his final project was raising $2,000 to raise a flag pole honoring veterans in Cordova. Of course, this achievment took hours of input from his family, his Troop 741 leaders and his fellow Scouts.\n\"It is now time to formally present you with Scouting's highest badge of accomplishment. The symbol of your success is the Eagle Scout badge and neckerchief, which will now be presented by your parents,\" Scoutmaster Brendan Beers said.\nOne of the most touching moments was when his parents, Paul and Kimberly, attached the Eagle Scout pin. He then attached pins on them for being a supportive Eagle Scout mom and dad.\nVincent's brother Paul Jr., also an Eagle Scout, said, \"What does the rank of Eagle Scout represent? To me it represents saying you are going to do something and then doing it. It represents goals realized, focus and strength of character. When the pressure is on and others would run around and panic, the Eagle Scout stays calm, cool and collected in the face of atrocity.\"\nAnother person who was there to guide and bear witness is Steve Bealefeld, assistant scoutmaster.\nHe said, \"He is a hard-working young man who has always had his head on straight.\"\nVincent's father listed many of the places the Scout troop went to go camping like the C & O Canal, Dorchester County and Tennessee. The biggest test was a 10-day hike at Philmont in New Mexico.\nThere was a testament to Vincent's leadership in the field. He was said to be an excellent cook with a Dutch oven. He can make peach cobbler and chicken pot pie.\n\"When he was in the lead, you were never going in the wrong direction. In the spartan wilds of Philmont, this was no small feat. Vincent is an excellent navigator. Vincent's attitude was equally as unflagging as his physical stamina. There is a deep keeled steadiness to his emotional thermostat,\" scout leader JoRoy Lizewski said.\nThen it was time for the politicians to offer large citations. President of Town of St. Michael's Commission David Breimhurst, Del. Tom Hutchison (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), community liaison to Andy Harris Mike Detmer and Maryland state Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) all spoke briefly. Vincent was given the United States flag and the Maryland Flag.\nVincent had the last word.\n\"I am so proud. I am happy that all my friends from 190 and 741 were here to celebrate this event with me, because it has been a long time coming. It is a bittersweet moment. I am glad I got Eagle Scout, but I will miss Scouting as a whole,\" Vincent said.\nHe tentatively has plans to attend University of Maryland at College Park in the fall. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chesapeake College's Hispanic/Latino Student Union provides community, support\n\n March 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 620\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Zulema Delacruz Martinez was a second-year student at Chesapeake College when LaSella Hall, director of diversity, equity and inclusion for Chesapeake College, approached her about starting a student-led union for the school's Latino community.Together, they started the Hispanic/Latino Student Union and have assisted in retention for the growing Latino student population at Chesapeake College.\nThe Hispanic/Latino Student Union hosted a night in late February to assist community members who were having trouble filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, commonly called FAFSA.\nThis form assists current and prospective college students to determine their eligibility for student financial aid.\nDelacruz Martinez said that more than 90 percent of attendees applied for Chesapeake College. She assisted families from all age groups, including grandparents with limited knowledge of the internet.\nFor many first-generation immigrant families, there is a caution with filling out FAFSA, especially if the student's parents are undocumented, Delacruz Martinez said.\nAccording to the federal student aid website, a parent's or spouse's citizenship status doesn't affect a student's ability to complete the FAFSA form.\nDelacruz Martinez said she hopes to spread the message that higher education is reachable for immigrant families.\n\"I want to serve my community,\" Delacruz Martinez said. \"I want to make sure that students and families are being taken care of and that they have the resources to know what to do. Because I went through that, I didn't have anyone to do that for me, and I was terrified. I was like, 'OK, let me make sure people don't go through that the same way I did.'\"\nLaSella Hall said he believes in the power of what student-led projects can do. He even developed his own method based on it.\nThe \"Hall Method\" focuses on empowering students, believing in their potential and guiding them toward success rather than just telling them what they can't do.\nHall said that if people don't understand where students are coming from or what they are going through, then telling them to succeed means nothing.\nHe recalls working with students in Atlanta who had parents addicted to drugs or students who had their lights turned off for three days. Hall said asking students to succeed academically was unreasonable when they had more significant issues they were worried about.\nThe Hall Method emphasizes having hard conversations, advocating for student voices at decision-making tables and leaving leadership of specific communities and cultures to members of those communities. Because of this method, Hall pushed hard to create the Hispanic/Latino Student Union.\n\"Student organizations really should be about advocacy and advancing the voice of those students,\" Hall said. \"It should be about tackling really important issues that the students feel passionate about.\"\nDelacruz Martinez notes that leading the Cinco de Mayo event made her work feel real and impactful to her school. Hall approached Delacruz Martinez when their organization was new, and all members were incredibly busy with school.\nThey met with members who didn't think they should do anything for the holiday because they didn't have the time, but Hall pushed Delacruz Martinez and other leaders to figure something out.\nDelacruz Martinez got to work. She made phone calls, did research and was able to take 10 students in a rented van to celebrate Cinco de Mayo at a local Hispanic restaurant. It made Delacruz Martinez feel accomplished.\nShe said she wants to run her own nonprofit and, more than anything, positively impact her community.\n\"I think coming from a minority community and coming from a single-parent household, there's a lot of challenges,\" Delacruz Martinez said. \"There were a lot of things I did not know, but the same with my community. I don't know if it's just resilience. I don't know if I'm just stubborn. But I think it's when you give us the opportunities, we'll take them on.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Remember to breathe. Remember why you are here.''On Saturday, March 2, this encouragement echoed through an almost silent room at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 7464 in Grasonville during the annual inspection for the Maryland Division of the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps. While many 10 to 18 year olds relax at home on a rainy Saturday morning, 21 Sea Cadets and eight League Cadets stood at attention.\nTheir uniforms carefully pressed and prepared, shoes shined and haircuts and hairstyles well groomed according to the set regulations. They were prepared and ready for their yearly inspection.\nThe purpose of annual inspection is to prepare for combat. Although these young men and women are not going into combat, they are preparing to be productive citizens now while also preparing to be future leaders who positively impact the world around them.\nMany do not know about this extraordinary program. But, some call it \"the Navy's best kept secret.\"\nEstablished in 1958 by the Secretary of the Navy, the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps are comprised of young men and women aged 10 through 18.\nThere are two programs within Sea Cadets, the Navy League Cadet Corps for middle school students aged 10 to 13, and the Naval Sea Cadet Corps for ages 13 through the end of high school.\nThrough the program, values of discipline, accountability and teamwork are instilled, giving cadets a chance to step outside of their comfort zones and helping them thrive.\nToday, the corps has 380 units and 9,000 enrolled. Although this program is supported by both the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, the goal is not to recruit for the military but to create respectable citizens in life \u2014 no matter what their career path may be.\nLt. Maryjoe Phillips, Sea Cadet Corps supply, finance and division officer, explains that she started with this program about 10 years ago as a \"drop off mom,\" when she would drop her daughter off to the Sea Cadet program.\nNot knowing much about the Sea Cadet program, Phillips was recruited by the master chief to help.\nTen years later, she is one of the driving forces behind this Sea Cadet unit.\n\"The program means a lot because we are turning out really great young men and women that are going to be beneficial to our society,\" Phillips said. \"We are raising patriots, which this country needs so badly.\"\nShe called the program \"a breath of fresh air.\"\n\"With some of the turmoil going on in the world, I have seen these Cadets do some really amazing things,\" Phillips said. \"I get so proud of them even though they are not children. I'm amazed at what can be done.\"\nStarting with only five cadets in 2018, the program has grown to 29 cadets and is still growing.\nIn April 2018, the Maryland Unit formed and was commissioned in May 2022. Before this unit formed, many parents drove their children over the bridge to Annapolis for drills and training.\nKent Island High School senior, Evan Newcomer, explained how he started his Sea Cadet training as a League Cadet in Annapolis at age 10. His parents said there were many families traveling back and forth at that time.\nNewcomer's parents asked to bring this program to Maryland's Eastern Shore. He now leads as a Naval Sea Cadet Corps petty officer second class.\nHis experience as a League Cadet and Sea Cadet has helped grow him into the leader he is now.\n\"I always had a dream of serving,\" Newcomer said, \"and I knew the military was always appealing to me. And the whole mission of all the branches was something that kind of shined to me. My uncle was a Naval Academy Grad. He inspired me to pursue that course as well as the other, older cadets in the program. (They) impressed me and made me want to pursue that dream.\"\nAfter Saturday's inspection finished, the unit and their families celebrated Evan's acceptance to West Point as a life sciences major studying pre-med.\nCadets and families come from Centreville, Easton, St. Michaels, Prince Frederick and everywhere in between, as the Maryland unit is the only unit on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\nInterested young persons ages 10-17 can join a drill weekend to learn more about the program. The unit is looking for adults that can give trainings (gun safety, medical and public safety) or help develop a new marksmanship program. Any interested adult volunteers that could help the program run smoothly or hold a position are welcome to contact Lt. Maryjoe Phillips at pti00803@ gmail.com or visit seacadets.org\nInterested young persons ages 10-17 can join a drill weekend to learn more about the program.

Peter and Paul High School.The team's project was a plan for a Salisbury Riverfront Community Center and included site logistics, design, cost estimates and timelines to pitch their vision for a center on the Wicomico River.\n\"The judges were blown away by the projects,\" Judge James Cook said. \"The industry is alive and well given what we have seen tonight.\"\nWhat the judges saw were project proposals by four teams. In addition to the Wicomico County team, Easton, Sts. Peter and Paul, and St. Michaels high schools competed for the gold cup and scholarships.\nThis was the 20th annual competition for ACE Mentors, a group of professionals representing the architecture, construction and engineering industries.\nEach team took the stage and pitched the case for their projects with slideshows.\nThe winning Wicomico project included landscape architecture and community art. The team presented the codes they would have to satisfy to create their building.\nAndrea Suk, Wicomico county coordinator, was thrilled with her students' win.\n\"We have 15 full time students,\" she said. \"These students are very interested in either architecture, construction or engineering.\"\nThe team worked with professional mentors in each of the ACE fields, mentors who volunteered their time to work with students.\n\"They give up their time to go into the schools and teach students about each of those fields and how they work together to create all the wonderful buildings and structures around us,\" Suk said.\nThe event was sponsored in part by the late Charles H. Thornton, a renowned structural engineer, educator and mentor who died in December. There were 26 other sponsors at different levels. The named scholarships were Easton Utilities, DBF/ACE Gerald Friedel Legacy, Lane Engineering, Griffith Family and CT Darnell Construction.\nThe platinum sponsors were the Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. and Willow Construction.\nThe St. Michaels High School project proposed a harbor floodgate to address global warming and the resulting flooding in town. The students proposed building a concrete wall with a 40-foot gate to let boats pass. The wall would go across the mouth of the harbor facing the Miles River.\nEaston High students proposed a tourist-friendly oyster hatchery called Project Clarity in Easton Point Park. Part of their plan was to bring oysters back to that part of Easton Point.\nThe last project, presented by the Sts. Peter and Paul team, proposed building a castle in Wye Mills near the intersection of U.S. Route 50 and state Route 404. The castle would host jousting and mixed martial arts programming. The colossal structure was estimated to cost more than $80 million to build.\n\"Our project is 'The Castle,'\" said Peter Anderson, a senior at Saints Peter and Paul. \"I really wanted to push the boundaries of ACE and break the mold and push the boundaries. I thought a castle would be big, bold and abrasive.\"\nThe presentations were reviewed by three judges \u2014 James Cook, vice president and project manager at Rauch; Aaron Goller, a civil engineer at Easton Utilities; and Rick VanEmburgh, engineer for the Town of Easton.\nLocal engineer Sean Callahan is the president of Lane Engineering and a mentor in the ACE program.\n\"ACE mentors does a tremendous job of bringing young folk up and showing them the ropes,\" Callahan said. \"It is great to see young folks get excited, and that is a part of what this is.\"\nAnother mentor working with students is Rebecca Saduk, a civil engineer for Easton Utilities.\n\"I wish I had had a program like ACE, and that is why I am so passionate about being a mentor,\" she said. \"These kids are learning real life work habits and how to work as a team.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "No one knows how to pay for Maryland's massive education reform\n\n March 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CAPITAL NEWS SERVICE | Section: State News \n \n 1537\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Maryland's Democratic-led legislature passed the Blueprint for Maryland's Future in 2021, vowing to pour billions of dollars into the state's public schools to offer universal pre-K, improve teaching and make sure students are ready for college or careers.But the General Assembly didn't outline a long-term plan to fund the ambitious 10-year education reform effort \u2014 which increasingly looks like a blueprint for red ink.\nThe Local News Network at the University of Maryland found that the Blueprint is already devouring hundreds of millions annually from the state's fund balance, which is on target to be fully drained in 2027.\nAnd according to a state Department of Legislative Services fiscal briefing released in January, the state will start running a structural deficit in fiscal year 2025 that will multiply nearly sixfold by fiscal year 2029, when it will hit $2.93 billion. Not coincidentally, that fiscal briefing estimates implementing the Blueprint will cost more than $4 billion in 2029.\nThe General Assembly's plan for dealing with the cost crunch? There isn't one \u2014 at least not yet. Neither Gov. Wes Moore in his State of the State address nor any of the Democratic state legislators interviewed for this story have offered any potential solutions for the coming Blueprint cash crunch.\n\"Several years from now we're going to have to have a much more direct conversation about the long-term costs,\" said state Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat from Baltimore City. \"But we're not there yet.\"\nRepublicans, meanwhile, see the Blueprint as a budget-breaker.\n\"We cannot pay these billions and billions of dollars in extra monies \u2014 not just state but local as well,\" said House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany). \"We can't pay for them unless you're going to talk about new taxes \u2014 and significant taxes.\"\nThe Blueprint's background\nIn 2016, then-Gov. Larry Hogan and the General Assembly created the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education to assess the public education system in Maryland and determine whether current funding schemes were conducive to student success.\nHeaded by William Kirwan, the former chancellor of the University System of Maryland, the commission came to the conclusion that an overhaul was needed.\n\"One of the 'aha' moments of the commission was really to face the fact that in Maryland, on what we call the Nation's Report Card, Maryland's score was about in the middle \u2026 and moving in the wrong direction,\" said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board, a state entity that's making sure school districts adhere to the plan.\nBut Hogan had an \"aha\" moment of his own after Democrats crafted the Kirwan Commission's report into comprehensive legislation. In 2019, Hogan criticized the pending reform proposal, telling a group of county officials it would mean \"billions and billions more in mandated spending increases for county and state taxpayers,\" according to The Frederick News-Post.\nHogan vetoed the bill creating the Blueprint in May 2020, saying he did not want to raise taxes amid the COVID-19 pandemic to fund the education plan. The General Assembly overrode his veto in 2021.\nAnd the following year, voters elected a strong backer of the Blueprint \u2014 Democrat Wes Moore \u2014 to succeed Hogan, who is now running for a U.S. Senate seat.\nOn the first day of the current legislative session that began in January, Moore said he believes in the reform plan and he will work with the General Assembly to ensure the Blueprint is implemented properly and sustainably.\n\"I believe in the premise and the promise of the Blueprint. I think we need a world-class education system in the state of Maryland,\" Moore said. \"I think that's going to be a prerequisite for us to be able to accomplish the economic goal that we're hoping for.\"\nLofty goals\nIn the state's 24 public school districts, the Blueprint and its lofty goals are already beginning to take shape.\nEach school district has already drawn up a preliminary plan for how it will meet targets for offering pre-K, increasing teacher salaries and improving student performance. The Accountability and Implementation Board has approved all those plans after first asking for revisions.\nThe Blueprint is meant to revamp the state's education system by presenting the same opportunities for all students. With a law like the Blueprint, one size has to fit all to achieve its goals of maximizing reading and math skills, as well as increasing pathways into college, said Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George's and Anne Arundel).\n\"So we want that for every kid across the state. We don't want variation of those goals,\" Rosapepe said. \"Now, the details of how stuff is paid for \u2014 I mean, I think that's a conversation that will be ongoing.\"\nCheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, said the teachers union is fully behind the Blueprint.\n\"We have a shared understanding that our goal is for students to succeed academically and become valuable citizens in our state and in our country,\" Bost said. \"In order to do that, we have to make an investment in public education. I think for the most part, the Blueprint identifies where that money has to go.\"\nWhat it doesn't do, however, is identify where the money will come from. Bost, whose union represents 74,000 educators in the state, acknowledged the concerns about the Blueprint's cost. But she indicated the increased spending on education is both needed and long overdue.\n\"We constitutionally have to provide a public education for all students, so the investment is needed,\" Bost said. \"And when some people balk at, 'Oh, it's all this money' \u2014 well, we've been starving public education for many years.\"\nThe budget dilemma\nThe Blueprint remains fully funded in Moore's latest fiscal year 2025 budget proposal, leaving many lawmakers to turn their attention to other legislative issues this year. Ferguson, the Senate president, said in terms of current Blueprint funding, \"we're more than fine.\"\nBut that's not so in the long term. The cost of implementing the Blueprint is projected to grow from $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $4.1 billion five years later, according to the Department of Legislative Services.\nMeanwhile, the state's structural budget gap is set to balloon every year through 2029 \u2014 when Legislative Services expects it to be $2.9 billion and the Moore administration says it will be about $3.5 billion.\nClosing that budget gap will be immensely difficult, said Christopher Summers, president and CEO of the conservative Maryland Policy Institute, who also said the Blueprint should be paused.\n\"Raising taxes (is) not going to solve this problem, and I think the governor knows that,\" said Summers, who has been critical of the Blueprint for years.\nThe Blueprint calls on school districts to increase education funding too, thereby prompting Summers to say that county budgets face the biggest fiscal threat.\nBut in Annapolis, lawmakers from both parties acknowledged that the General Assembly will have to make some tough decisions in the years to come as the Blueprint's bills come due.\n\"I think we know the reality that we're facing. And I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion about that,\" said State Sen. Guy J. Guzzone, a Democrat from Howard County. \"I just don't know that there's an immediate answer.\"\nOne obvious solution would be raising taxes to cover the state's coming shortfalls. But Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey, a Republican from the Eastern Shore, said a solution lies in cutting back the demands of the Blueprint rather than paying for the sweeping overhaul as it stands.\n\"Republicans have stated very often that we need to move to a 'Blueprint lite' or you know, some type of education reform that takes some of the important components of the Blueprint, but at the same time is affordable and allows counties to make decisions on which parts of the Blueprint are more meaningful in each of their public school systems,\" Hershey said.\nDemocrats, however, back the current Blueprint, despite its cost. Del. Ben Barnes, a Democrat who chairs the Appropriations Committee, said legislators should start talking about a long-term payment plan for the Blueprint now. The shared values between the legislature and the governor will bring them together, Barnes said, to solve the Blueprint budget dilemma.\n\"This legislature, the governor, we share values, and those shared values include all the priorities of the Blueprint,\" Barnes said. \"Getting to children who live in communities of poverty, taking care of special needs students, I mean, these are what we all ran on. And so I feel confident we'll find the revenue we need to support that program.\"\nSeveral state officials have said they are looking to the Accountability and Implementation Board to issue recommendations regarding the Blueprint's budget challenges. The board has made policy proposals included in bills that, if passed this legislative session, would make adjustments to the law without changing the finances.\nIn addition, the board is set to release additional recommendations this legislative session.\n\"What the AIB has tried to sort of suggest is like, let's try to implement it the way it's intended. And if it doesn't work, if it's just no longer the right thing to do, then we need to change it,\" said Hise, the board's executive director. \"But for many things, we haven't gotten to that point yet.\"\nCapital News Service reporters Kiersten Hacker, Christina Walker and Ela Jalil wrote this article.\nCapital News Service reporters Kiersten Hacker, Christina Walker and Ela Jalil wrote this article. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Herzog Foundation.The Herzog Foundation is a national organization dedicated to \"advancing Christian education.\" The foundation enriches Christian (K-12) education by creating and leading various programs.\nOne of these programs was the 2023 Bill of Rights Essay Contest. All middle and high school students enrolled in a Christian school or those homeschooled in the U.S. were eligible to participate. Winners were selected from one middle school and one high school. Each winner would go on to receive $250 from the Herzog Foundation. The winners' schools also received an additional $250.\nParticipants were asked to answer these questions in three pages or less, \"What made the Bill of Rights so revolutionary and unique when it was ratified? How has the Bill of Rights shaped our country?\"\nIn an excerpt from Viana's eloquently crafted three-page essay, the middle school winner wrote, \"The Bill of Rights is famous for that little, life-changing word: freedom, but what most people don't realize is that these documents weren't written overnight. Real people struggled, wrestled, and mulled over each word and phrase that went into the Bill of Rights, until it was finally ratified on December 15, 1791. Not only was it composed through much time and consideration but it secured the rights of people today granting our blessed country to grow, expand, and enter new times of innovation. It summarized what we stood for then and stand for now. It lets a person breathe, work, and earn their way to success.\"\nThe Herzog Foundation announced Viana, daughter of George and Cathy Johnston, as the middle school winner of the contest in December. Johnston received the prize money and a trophy for her achievement.\nIn a release announcing the winners, Herzog Foundation Chairman Todd Graves said, \"The Bill of Rights was ratified over 230 years ago and still stands as a beacon for our most fundamental rights as Americans. It's crucial that all young students understand the significance of this founding document.\"\nKathy Guerra, head of Lighthouse Christian Academy, stated the school was initially in disbelief, as this was the first time their school had made an entry to a contest of this magnitude. However, they were not surprised that Viana had won, as she is a gifted writer who creates masterworks of art with her words. \"Viana is an inquisitive, energetic, and ambitious student,\" says Guerra, who \"seeks to excel in all of her subjects.\"\nTo learn more about the Herzog Foundation and the programs it has to offer, visit www.herzog foundation.com. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Target team will not see expansion this season\n\n March 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 569\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE \u2014 Shawn Connolly, head coach for the Kent Island Clay Target Team, presented updates and hopes for expansion to the Queen Anne's Board of Education during their regular meeting March 6.Connolly celebrated the the team, who was featured in the fall issue of PullUSA Magazine.\nSeveral of the students, along with Connolly, were interviewed for the national publication that is distributed to 36,000 students around the country in 37 states, he said. The Kent Island team is recognized as being the first public school in Maryland to join the USA High School Clay Target League.\n\"It was very cool to see ourselves in the spotlight,\" he said.\nConnolly appeared before the board this month to seek approval to expand the team's student limit to accommodate growing interest in the sport.\nSchool team limits are typically based on funding, transportation, or the nature of the sport, none of which are applicable in the target team's case, noted Connolly.\nThe team is self funded and participates at a private facility with all transportation, sponsorship and insurance covered, he said.\n\"I'm just trying to provide this sport to as many as I can,\" he added.\nConnolly noted the official league rules mandate a ratio of 10 students to one coach, and he has personally mandated even more strict requirements, with one coach for every squad of five students.\nNow the team currently has six all-volunteer coaches, \"And we have many more that would be willing to help out, and there are always parents,\" he said.\nAll students are welcome to the target team no matter their athletic ability; it allows students to wear a uniform and be a part of team who might not otherwise, Connolly said.\n\"One of the beauties of this league is that everybody participates,\" without tryouts and slots available only for the most skilled students, he said. However, students must pass a safety program and register before they participate.\nLast year the team turned away about five students due to capacity, he said.\nAs team capacity falls under the superintendent's authority, the board turned to Superintendent Patricia Saelens, who noted Queen Anne's County was the only public school district in Maryland that offered clay target teams as an engaging extracurricular activity, not to mention scholarship opportunities.\nSaelens thanked Connolly for his leadership and passion to bring the sport to students, but said at this time the district will not be expanding the program.\n\"I think we are very blessed and very lucky that we have had this opportunity in this district,\" she said.\nThe Queen Anne's School District is insured through the Maryland Association of Boards of Education (MABE), and although the target team covers its own insurance, the MABE attorney has cautioned districts against expanding target teams due to affiliation that could potentially expose districts to potential risk and litigation.\nCurrently Queen Anne's County School District pays an increased premium for any firearms within the district, including school resource officers funded through the Queen Anne's County Sheriff's Department, according to Saelens.\nMABE will be meeting again in April to consider revisions and amendments, including potentially increasing premiums, she said.\nAt the moment, the district will keep the team limit as it is and wait to see how the MABE discussion unfolds.\nConnolly said he understood the decision and thanked the board and superintendent for their time.\nThe Queen Anne's County Board of Education will next meet for a work session March 20 at 5 p.m. and hold a regular meeting April 10 at 6 p.m. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The board also heard from Talbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones about the district's research into whether this club could be created at TCPS.\nDuring public comment, Sheriff Joe Gamble spoke on behalf of the Talbot County Sheriff's Office about the importance of having a space for a group of teens to come together and be a part of something.\n\"We all know kids want to be a part of a group, they want to be a part of something,\" he said. \"The Sheriff's Office fully supports another venue for our youth to connect with other people of like-minded and like interests.\"\nAustin Eader, a ninth grader at Easton High School, said that this week he gathered 191 student signatures and 24 teacher and staff signatures from people who support having the club.\nMany of people interested in starting the club, including Talbot Rod & Gun Club President Joe Capozzoli, spoke at a board meeting in October requesting approval to create the club.\nAfter that meeting, TCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi instructed her staff to look into what it would take to make the club happen. At the meeting Wednesday, Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction Helga Einhorn said Jones has been leading that charge.\nJones told the board that the district has been meeting with those interested in starting the club to gather more information. She said the biggest concern right now is figuring out if the club could in any way jeopardize the district financially \u2014 particularly from a risk management perspective.\nShe said that although they have heard about the training and safety precautions required to participate in the program, it still involves putting a firearm in students' hands.\n\"We have to be very thoughtful about that,\" she said.\nThe district has gone to its insurance provider, the Maryland Association of Boards of Education Group Insurance Pool. Jones said a discussion around the topic was held at a February MABE meeting, and MABE intends to hold a session and vote on this at its annual meeting in late April.\nJones said the district will need to consider whether MABE will continue to provide liability coverage if an incident were to happen and, if so, whether it would be at an additional cost. She said the district doesn't have these answers yet because MABE hasn't voted on it yet.\nJones said she should have these answers for the May Board of Education meeting.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said the board and district are at MABE's mercy at this point. She said that as long as MABE has this discussion in April, the board should be able to make a firm decision in May regarding the creation of the club.\nAt the end of the meeting, board member Deborah Bridges said she is on board with the creation of the team.\n\"I think it would be a wonderful addition to our county,\" she said. \"I think it's important because girls can do it too. And there's limited access for females these days. And also for the children that can't do regular athletics, because they can be a part of it too.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He is serving the final months of David Bromwell's term as superintendent. Bromwell officially stepped down from the position March 1.\nBefore taking on the role of interim superintendent, Thompson served as assistant superintendent for DCPS. He began that role in September.\nThompson, who was sworn in to the Talbot County Board of Education in December of 2022, said in an interview that he will miss working on the Talbot County Board of Education.\n\"I've always been on the other side of the fence in relation to education,\" he said. \"But on the board side, I learned a lot about policy, budgeting and things of that nature. So it was a very valuable experience.\"\nHe said his experience as a board member is beneficial to his new role as interim superintendent, particularly when it comes to understanding the relationship between a superintendent and board of education.\nTCPS Executive Assistant Charlene Gould said Thursday that the governor's office has been notified of the District 1 vacant seat. The governor's office is responsible for appointing someone to fill that seat until Thompson's term expires in 2026.\nThompson said his advice for whoever fills his seat is to listen.\n\"I just learned to listen,\" he said about when he started on the board. \"And then make decisions after I listened to what people had to say.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The day is always well received by students and organizations alike, he said.\nCareer coaches work with students throughout the year to identify those who would most benefit from the program, he said.\nStorck was grateful for the collaboration and thanked the high school administration for leading the way for their students to be on the track to greatness.\n\"They are here because they care about the success of their students,\" he said.\nThroughout the day of career discovery, students received one on one individual learning opportunities from professionals through mock interviews and financial guidance workshops.\nChesapeake College also presented information on what vocational classes can do for career growth and continual development.\nA career fair with 30 local businesses welcomed students to discover hiring opportunities and highlighted skills through a multitude of interests available to them right in their own backyard.\nFounder of local IT company Corsica Technologies, guest speaker Dale Walls shared what perseverance can mean for your own story of success.\nWalls recounted his own rocky childhood after which he found structure and direction in the United States Marine Corps before going on to found Corsica Technologies.\nSince stepping down as CEO, Walls has continued his impressive resume, running marathons, coaching youth football and raising a family.\nEncouraging students to take charge of their lives, Walls noted it was perfectly okay not to know what you wanted to do with your life as a high schooler, as long as you were moving forward trying to identify the kind of person you wanted to be.\nTo do that, he reiterated the importance of setting goals with clarity, having courage and leading the way for future self-success.\n\"You are the one who is going to get you there,\" he said.\nThe day of career exploration is very important to the Rotary Club mindset of \"Service Above Self,\" according to Kent Island chapter President Candi Cook.\nThe job fair helps students explore the local area for career opportunities in one convenient place and helps eliminate the misconception that students need to leave the area to find quality jobs.\n\"There are plenty of opportunities for successful post-high school careers that don't require a college degree and taking on tons of debt,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The second tier is for students who need additional support and the last tier is for students who struggle the most with meeting grade level literacy requirements.\nCCPS works in collaboration with the Professional Development Center for Educators at the University of Delaware where officials continue to develop the multi-tier system to ensure CCPS continues to make data informed decisions when matching students with literacy learning resources.\n\"We want to continue the work we are acknowledged for because our kids deserve it,\" said CCPS's Instructional Coordinator for Elementary English Language Arts, Sherry Eichinger-Wilson.\nThe work of both Eichinger-Wilson and Asplen have allowed CCPS to lead the state for meeting the requirements of the 2019 Ready to Read Act, the science-based program, Science of Reading, and the College and Career Readiness portion of Blueprint for Maryland's Future \u2014 a statewide funding initiative that aims to increase education quality and funding in Maryland.\n\"The focus is to make sure that what we offer in our program is aligned to the Science of Reading,\" Eichinger-Wilson said. \"We have a vertical alignment from grades K-12 and we are continuing to evaluate the parts of our program to ensure that they are aligned and that we are meeting the needs of all of our students.\"\nCecil and Washington County are the only two counties in the state to be deemed as Literacy Learning Lab models for leveraging student support aligned with the Science of Reading to improve literacy outcomes for students in fourth through eighth grade. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland\u2019s teacher shortage: Will the Blueprint\u2019s plan for better pay, training do enough?\n\n March 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AIDAN HUGHES and DARANEE BALACHANDAR Capital News Service | Section: Business \n \n 1505\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fifth-grade teacher Melissa Carpenter works a 10-hour day on average during the week, and her job sometimes requires her to put in hours on weekends, too.\"I feel like teaching is one of those jobs where we go to work to do more work \u2014 to do work after work,\" said Carpenter, who teaches at William B. Wade Elementary School in Waldorf, in Charles County.\nCarpenter's long hours are far from unique among Maryland's educators, as the state and nation grapple with a teacher shortage.\nThe U.S. Department of Education keeps a Teacher Shortage Areas database \u2014 and it found that for the current school year, Maryland was short of teachers in 28 subjects, which the state defines as \"areas of certification.\" That's up from 17 five years earlier.\nSome teacher certification areas \u2014 such as English as a second language, health science and special education \u2014 are short on teachers from pre-K through the 12th grade.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future \u2014 a landmark state law reforming public education \u2014 aims to fix that problem by \"elevating the stature of the teaching profession\" through higher pay, better training and stronger recruitment efforts.\nHowever, experts and educators have mixed views about whether that will successfully address the root causes of the shortage.\n\"Money is a huge help, but it's not everything,\" said Simon Birenbaum, director of grading, assessment and scheduling at Baltimore City Public Schools. \"Human capital is the biggest issue, and money can help with that problem, but recruiting, training and retaining high-quality teachers and staff has to be the primary focus. No amount of money can compensate for a lack of highly-skilled educators.\"\nDocumenting the shortageMaryland's teacher woes follow national trends. The National Center for Education Statistics reported 86% of U.S. K-12 public schools faced challenges in hiring teachers for the current school year.\nAmid the shortage, the Blueprint calls for hiring an unspecified number of additional teachers to ease the workload of classroom veterans.\n\"You hear a lot about the teacher shortage \u2014 and how are we going to implement all these Blueprint programs, which require additional staffing, when we have a teacher shortage?\" asked Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\nShortages stem, in part, from the fact that teachers are leaving the profession. In Prince George's County, 1,126 teachers resigned between July 2022 and July 2023 \u2014 up from 989 the previous year, The Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, 625 resigned in Montgomery County Public Schools, up from 576 a year earlier.\nDorchester County experienced the highest attrition rate in Maryland during the 2021-22 school year at 18%, according to a Department of Education report.\n\"I used to never have people just quit in the middle of the year,\" said Dorchester County Superintendent Dave Bromwell, who recently retired. \"The pandemic told some people, you know what? If you're not happy, move on.\"\nAll those factors end up impacting teachers like Carpenter. She said her grade level saw an influx of students, with around 30 students in her own fifth grade class this year.\n\"Our class sizes are growing, and we don't have the support in place to help some of our struggling learners,\" she said.\n'Teaching isn't approved'Schools are suffering from a long-term decline in the number of people interested in becoming teachers.\nThat decline has been ongoing since the mid-'70s, \"but it gets worse and worse and worse, year over year,\" said Mike Hansen, an education policy expert at the Brookings Institution.\nAccording to the State Department of Education, 9,134 people were enrolled in teacher preparation programs in the state in 2012. That number plummeted by about half by 2017, but rose to 6,037 by 2020.\nWhy is teaching becoming less appealing as a career? Zid Mancenido, a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, has been studying that issue.\n\"One of the major findings of my research has been that people are taught over time that teaching isn't a great career,\" he said in a 2022 interview on the school's website. \"There are all these tiny interactions they have over their lifetime that give them this feeling that teaching isn't approved, that they should be aspiring to other careers that might be more prestigious or well-paid.\"\nAmid the shortage, many schools hire less-credentialed \"conditional\" teachers \u2014 those who have not yet received their professional certifications. Maryland's issuance of conditional certificates more than doubled between 2018 to 2022, a state Department of Education report said.\nIn Charles County, where Carpenter works, 12.4% of all teachers held conditional certificates by 2021 \u2014 a rate only surpassed by Baltimore City (13.4%) and Prince George's County (14.3%).\nCarpenter said experienced teachers are leaned on to help the conditional hires.\n\"Which would be fine if you had one or two teachers who needed that support. But we have a massive amount of teachers who are conditional right now,\" she said.\nThe Blueprint's pay bumpIn order to address the teacher shortage, the Blueprint provides a number of measures that lawmakers hope will encourage people to become teachers and ensure that existing ones don't leave for more lucrative out-of-state positions \u2014 or exit the profession altogether.\nA key Blueprint initiative increases teacher pay to a minimum of $60,000 by 2026. In some counties, that means a nearly $15,000 pay bump for new teachers.\nDavid Larner, chief human resource and professional development officer at the Howard County Public School System, said the pay raise will attract teachers from other states and build up Maryland's teacher workforce.\n\"If our salaries are higher than salaries in surrounding states \u2026 then candidates are more likely to come,\" Larner explained.\nHowever, Hansen, of the Brookings Institution, expressed skepticism about the likely impact of the measure on the state's teacher shortage.\nHansen argued that rather than a universal rise in minimum salary levels, money should be targeted where it's needed the most \u2014 attracting teacher talent in high-need schools and specialized fields like STEM subjects and special education. He also highlighted research that suggests salary is just one of many factors that can lead to teacher attrition.\n\"I think we need to be paying teachers more \u2014 I don't think paying a $60,000 minimum wage is the way to do it,\" he said.\nBoosting careers and diversityThe Blueprint also aims to improve teacher quality by encouraging educators to obtain additional training.\nThe plan provides for a salary increase of $10,000 for teachers who become National Board Certified, an advanced teaching credential that fewer than 6% of Maryland teachers held at the start of 2023, according to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. Teachers in high-need areas may see their annual salaries increase by up to $17,000 by becoming certified.\n\"We want to professionalize the career of teaching, and I think that is absolutely what we should be doing,\" said Stephanie Novak Pappas, principal of the Holabird Academy, an elementary and middle school in Baltimore.\nHowever, Hansen questioned the Blueprint's emphasis on National Board certification.\n\"We don't have a lot of evidence that actually getting your NBC makes you a better teacher,\" Hansen said.\nThe Blueprint also calls on school districts to create a diverse workforce. The Accountability and Implementation Board \u2014 which oversees the Blueprint \u2014 will evaluate those efforts.\nA diverse workforce has significant benefits, according to David Blazar, an education policy expert at the University of Maryland.\nBlazar said that increasing the share of Black teachers has \"exceptionally large impacts on students' short and long term outcomes,\" he said. \"I'd say some of the largest impacts I've seen across all of the educational intervention literature.\"\nBut maximizing the benefits of a more diverse workforce will be complicated, Blazar said. Even if the state's teacher workforce came to match the demographics of its students, there would likely still be \"clustering of Black teachers within certain districts, and within certain schools within districts,\" he said.\nHansen echoed those concerns, and said that teachers nationwide remain even more racially segregated than students. Rather than aiming to make the teachers within individual districts reflect the exact racial demographics as their students, he suggested that policymakers should \"maximize exposure and access to a diverse set of teachers for every student\" across different regions.\nA work in progressBeyond the Blueprint, the General Assembly last year passed the Maryland Educator Shortage Reduction Act, which requires the state to set recruitment goals for teacher education programs, creates an alternative teacher prep program for early childhood educators and establishes a $20,000 yearly stipend for eligible student teachers.\nGov. Wes Moore, who proposed the legislation, said upon signing it that it is intended to place \"world class teachers in every classroom.\"\nCarpenter, the Charles County teacher, said future changes may be necessary, too.\n\"We will have new students next year, and they will [have] different needs. So we need to make sure that we are constantly evolving,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Sparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George's County, stressed that reinforcing the teacher workforce is key to the Blueprint's overall success.\n\"It lands in the hands of our educators, and if we don't have educators who are highly qualified or able to do the work, then the Blueprint work would never get accomplished,\" she said.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "College students travel to every Easton in US\n\n March 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 626\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 Three students and a recent alumna at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, had a crazy idea.What could be discovered traveling to every incorporated \"Easton\" in America? The last stop on their voyage of discovery was Easton, Maryland, where they met Mayor Megan Cook last weekend.\nOne of the group members, Remy Oktay, was a pilot, allowing them to travel by single engine airplane to each town. There was no way to get to these towns by commercial flight so barnstorming in the four-seater made sense.\nThe tour criss-crossed the United States, taking off from Easton, Pennsylvania, to fly to Easton, Illinois. Then it was on to Easton, Kansas and Missouri.\nFrom there, they headed south to Easton, Texas, before heading north to Easton, Minnesota, and Easton, Wisconsin.\nMore Eastons were visited in Michigan, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire and New York.\n\"And now we are in Maryland,\" Oktay said. \"This is the last stop.\"\nElisabeth Seidel said that Wikipedia lists 21 Eastons in the United States. They decided to visit the incorporated ones.\nWhat makes a town? Is it a high school? A mayor? A Lion's Club? Often there was little on Wikipedia, the group found.\nThey took a one-hour walking tour of downtown and looked through a book of old photos with their guide from the Talbot Historical Society.\n\"She knew everything,\" Seidel said. \"I am very interested in the preservation of local history.\"\nThe hardest part of the trip was keeping the weight down in the small craft. They kept collecting souvenirs along the way. Shipping the mementos back to school was the only solution to remain five pounds under regulation weight.\nThe trip was a mix of personal and academic. The students are not getting credit, but an alumnus paid some of their expenses. The school paid for hotels, food and transportation. They plan to cowrite an article for their school newspaper about the experience.\n\"We found an alum who is into aviation and was like, 'This sounds cool. Here are a few thousand dollars. Go have fun,'\" Oktay said. Their biggest cost was aviation fuel.\nThe search for Eastons began with cookies.\n\"Trebor and I did an article for the newspaper. We tried all of the chocolate chip cookies in Easton, Pennsylvania, that we could find. We tried them all, ranked them all. We compared them. They were ranked on a scale of one to five milks,\" Seidel said.\nThen they got to thinking what else they could explore.\n\"I had known there were other towns called Easton. It started off as a joke. We thought we could go to maybe three or four over spring break. Then we were talking to Remy, who is a pilot, ... and things spiraled from there,\" Seidel said.\nWhen asked if they had a favorite Easton, the answers came quick: \"No comment. Restricted information. We cannot say.\"\n\"There were real people that we have made friends with in the last 10 days,\" Trebor Maitin said. \"Everyone has their own unique thing to bring to the table.\"\nThey found people to be friendly once Easton residents realized what their motive was.\n\"We have been stopping people in the streets and even doing some door knocks to chat with the locals and get a better understanding of the history,\" Lucie Lagodich said. \"We have met people whose families have lived in these Eastons for generations.\"\nWhenever they were in doubt about whom to contact in a town, they went to the local bar. As soon as they told their story, the bar stools would invariably swivel toward them.\n\"It is really amazing to see all these towns. It really changes the way you view America,\" Lagodich said.\n\"This trip has made me a better reporter and a better person,\" Maitin said. \"I feel a lot more comfortable walking into a situation where not everybody looks like me.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Foundation of HOPE leading girls to success\n\n March 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 606\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 On Wednesday evening, Keasha Haythe, founder of the Foundation of HOPE, an after-school program for middle school girls on the Eastern Shore, led the program hosted at Easton Middle School's Library.Haythe introduced this week's guest speaker, John Englehart, assistant manager of human resources for Easton Utilities, to the cohort of girls.\nDuring Englehart's presentation, Haythe stood in the back wearing a pink shirt and gray blazer. She smiled at the enjoyment that filled the room. Girls discussed and practiced the best ways to market themselves to achieve their career and education goals.\nHaythe, an economic development veteran and certified economic developer, founded the Foundation of Helping Others Prosper and Excel. Its mission is to help young girls and women lead productive lives in their communities by providing cultural, social, spiritual and educational development.\nThe program serves sixth-grade girls attending middle school. This after-school program covers low self-esteem, bullying, social media, workforce development, economic and community development, financial literacy and more.\n\"We prepare them to be independent and self-sufficient as well as exposing them to opportunities, thought-provoking conversations and activities,\" Haythe said.\nHaythe began the Foundation of HOPE over eight years ago. She said this program has been a community effort since the very beginning.\nDuring the program's early days, Giuffrida's Pizza donated weekly food for the girls to snack on. From there, more and more businesses have assisted in the nutrition of the girls to make sure they are well prepared to learn.\nHaythe said the success of this program would not have been possible without the generous support of volunteers, business partners, board members and donors.\nDuring the pandemic, Haythe and her daughter worked together to create a curriculum for the program. The curriculum, divided into 16 weeks, covered healthy lifestyles, economic development, entrepreneurship and potential futures with education.\nThis week, representatives from Easton Utilities led a presentation by showing a clip from Englehart's favorite movie, \"The Pursuit of Happiness.\" Through the film, Englehart showed the girls how to properly prepare themselves for the working world.\nHe said it was an honor to be invited to speak at the event and support such a commendable foundation. As a human resources professional, he is committed to fostering the growth and development of the next generation by equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to pursue their goals.\n\"I hope it will inspire them to not only envision their future dream jobs but also understand the steps needed to achieve and excel in them,\" Englehart said. \"Moments like these reaffirm my passion for HR and the pivotal role it plays in shaping the workforce of tomorrow.\"\nHis presentation included helping the girls create a career map to reach their goals, developing and practicing an elevator pitch for potential employers, and learning the best ways to write a resume by becoming \"resume detectives\" on practice resumes.\nWhen Englehart finished his presentation, he passed out Easton Utilities swag bags before passing along a final message and gift.\nHe gave each girl his business card and told them that before they started applying for their first job, he would help them develop a resume and do practice interviews to prepare them for the workforce.\nAll the girls crowded around him as Haythe took a photo \u2014 big smiles on everyone's face. Haythe thanked Englehart for his time before cleaning the library with the assistance of the cohort of girls.\n\"This program allows me to use my passion for empowering women and girls through economic development strategies,\" Haythe said. \"This after-school program is an alternative narrative from what they hear from peers and social media. They are setting career goals, and the Foundation of HOPE is here to help them achieve those goals.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Board of Education Member Donna DiGiacomo resigns\n\n March 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: News \n \n 547\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 After three years and four months in office, Caroline County Board of Education member Donna DiGiacomo has resigned, citing concerns following a back-and-forth between DiGiacomo and Superintendent Derek Simmons at the board's March 5 meeting.She emailed her resignation to the Maryland Superintendent of Education Monday.\n\"My problem on the board is I care about the students and I care about teachers,\" she said in an interview Monday afternoon. \"I got a lot of pressure to make it look like we all agreed. But the thing that got me that I finally said I cannot in any way, shape or form be associated with was at the March 5 meeting.\"\n\"The superintendent called some employees minions. I was like 'did you just say minions? Mindless people who just do what you say?'\" she said.\nThe exchange between Simmons and DiGiacomo, which can be viewed in the recorded meeting on the board's website, resulted from a conversation in which the superintendent discussed the district's upcoming switch from Apple laptops to Google Chrome ones.\nHe talks about how many people it took to get the computers ready for summer.\n\"For getting the devices ready for summer, we don't quite need quite the large numbers of minions, as the devices come in more ready to go out the door. So it helps us on that end as well,\" he said in the meeting.\nDiGiacomo asks, \"Minions?... I guess just the word kind of offends me\u2026 'Minions' offends me. It did offend me.\"\nSimmons said, \"I didn't mean to offend you. I was thinking Minion movies.\"\nMembers of the board laughed.\nShe said, \"A minion is a person that does what they, without thinking. That is all. It is derogatory.\"\nSimmons responded, \"Wasn't meant to be offensive, Mrs. DiGiacomo.\"\nShe said, \"I don't think anyone would be appreciative of that,\" before the board returned to their initial discussion.\nSimmons did not directly respond to a request for comment about the exchange, though the school district did issue a press release following DiGiacomo's resignation.\nDiGiacomo's term was supposed to end Nov. 30. She came to the position after 20 years as a high school English teacher.\n\"The main statement I am trying to make by resigning eight months early is I do not want anyone to think that I condone what is going on,\" she said.\n\"... I am not trying to start trouble. I just want people to know that I really did try my best,\" she said. \"But I can't be a part of something that doesn't respect the employees. Calling people minions is not respectful. I don't want people to think I quit. It is a moral thing for me.\"\n\"I think the people who voted for me have the right to know why I made that decision,\" she said.\nThe Board of Education's statement on the resignation thanks DiGiacomo for her time on the board.\nIn it, Board President Richard Barton stated, \"On behalf of the Caroline County Board of Education, we thank Mrs. DiGiacomo for the time she spent on the board and appreciate her service to the staff and students of Caroline County Public Schools.\"\nThe board also said, \"regarding the vacancy this resignation creates, the board will discuss options as they pertain to Maryland law with the board attorney at their next meeting.\"\nThe next meeting is on April 2 at 6 p.m. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "WKHS celebrates 50 years of student public radio\n\n March 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LISA J. GOTTO Special to the Kent County News | Section: News \n \n 1312\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WORTON \u2014 It's just a normal early morning at 90.5 WKHS when we arrive to the radio station at Kent County High School. As the school's first of four instructional periods commences, so does the first student disc jockey take her place at the microphone in the facility's live on-air studio.Over the next few hours, she'll not only intro and recap songs from an extensive, vetted playlist, but she'll talk to the station's loyal listeners about what's going on at school, in the county and the greater world. The delivery is smooth and polished, and left to the reliability of just one's own ears, you'd never know that this DJ isn't even 18 years old yet.\nToday, senior Emma Morris is joined by senior Averie Hitzges, and the subject of conversation for a bit is a reminder that it is the last day of the station's spring fundraising drive. As is the case with any enterprise of this nature, donations are not only welcomed, but they're vital.\nTo date, those donations have been coming in from loyal listeners and community partners for 50 years \u2014 an amazing feat, especially when you consider that the young people who are populating the air waves with their voices did not grow up listening to traditional radio at all.\nSo in a social culture where it's more likely you're going to listen to a podcast downloaded to your phone during drive-time than a local radio station, how does this eight-studio, 17,500-watt local station remain relevant and a vital part of the high school's Career and Technical Education program?\nAn essential part of that success can be attributed to the current station manager, Chris Singleton. At the helm since 2008, Singleton was quick to point out that he is just one of a long line of integral station managers WKHS has had the good fortune to work with since that first day in 1974 when they went on-air with their format of educational and public affairs-type programming, as well as a wide-ranging playlist that began mid-morning on the March 28.\nAppropriately enough, that first tune played was Elton John's signature hit, \"Rocket Man,\" relayed Singleton, who obviously understands the importance of a mission and knowing when it's time to come back down to Earth.\nWith every school year, he said, he does contend with a student body that might not understand the connection and importance of continuing the legacy of the radio station at the school.\n\"It's like having a kid attend culinary school, when they've never even tasted food,\" he analogized.\nObviously, his plan for getting kids invested is working, as when the bell rings the senior DJs are replaced with equally fresh-faced junior class DJs \u2014 and the next portion of the school-day broadcast continues.\nSenior Lizzy Watkins, 18, is just one of the students who became invested in the program for the 2023-2024 school year. She was at the station that morning conducting a bunch of tasks; everything from providing the morning's weather forecast to working on an on-going project that flexes her creative muscles.\nWatkins aspires to a career in graphic design and gets to try her hand, and brain, at projects geared to such things as part of her role at the station.\n\"So for me, because I'm going into graphic design and marketing, being here allows me to start to feel what it is that graphic designers do when they're being handed something from a customer who asks, 'Hey, can you do this?'\"\nWatkins said the process of being able to create and talk through the collaborative process is giving her valuable real-life experience and has helped build her self-confidence.\nFor junior, Jonah Elburn, 16, it's the sense of professionalism that he feels when enters the station each day.\n\"This is something that I love more than anything. It feels, and everyone says it, not like you're in high school, but you're in a working environment,\" Elburn said. \"There's a professionalism that at least the vast majority of people that step through these doors have, the way everything has grown [here] as a business. This is not just another high school class. This is a business.\"\nSoon after, the \"business-of-broadcasting\" tour took us down a hall where the stacks of LPs and 45s used to be kept for easy access to the then two-studio station. Things have changed quite a bit since then, but not until 2018 did the station have its most comprehensive infrastructure upgrade, Singleton said.\nThe $160,000 station remodel included the addition of six new studios, including an enlarged, on-air studio, a dedicated newsroom, production studios and various equipment upgrades.\nSingleton said they were finally able to address the problem of flimsy, particle-board type walls replacing them with structures that were more acoustically sound, and they were able to incorporate an adjacent classroom into their footprint by taking down a wall. This classroom now houses the station's carefully curated collection of nostalgic radio receivers, audio consoles and other equipment from days gone by that provide a visual history of radio broadcasting.\nOn hand, and actually pitching in for every upgrade, was Singleton and another essential member of the staff, Ken Collins. Collins thoroughly enjoys his part-time role in sales and fundraising for the station, and shares many of Singleton's memories of what it took to get the station to the point where it could be celebrating its 50th year in student public radio.\nCollins' role, said Singleton, was part of a larger initiative dating back to 2013, when Kent County Schools welcomed a new administrator, Dr. Karen Couch. It was at that time, said Singleton, that he was most concerned about the future of the broadcasting program at the high school. There had already been substantial talk about whether or not the station would remain a viable part of the curriculum.\nSingleton was certainly hoping that a new administration didn't signal the demise of one of the school's oldest programs. The advent of new technologies and ways of thinking could easily have derailed the plans he already had for what was needed next to keep it going.\nFortunately, after much in-depth conversation with the superintendent, Singleton learned that he could count on her to support his efforts to keep the program going. Couch, who retires this year, would champion the program again by allowing the station to hire for the part-time fundraising position that Collins would eventually fill.\n\"This would not have happened if we didn't have superintendent-level support,\" Singleton said. \"So, we're hopeful that the incoming superintendent could be just as passionate and just as enthusiastic. I think, hopefully coming off of this 50th anniversary wave and with all the positive community dynamics, the new superintendent will pick up on that and go, 'Yeah, this is something we probably need to keep going.' And until they give me a reason not to, we'll just keep on going.\"\nThe next big thing, said Singleton, is the biggest thing of all. Literally. The station's tower, actually the oldest piece of infrastructure being erected in 1973, now needs to be replaced. This is Singleton's newest mission.\n\"I would much rather be able to replace that proactively, than the alternative of just having it come down on its own.\"\nAnd so, the station's story is still being written and the program continues to inspire the students who reach out to embrace it.\n\"For whom we are and what we have, I am pretty happy for where we are,\" said Singleton.\nAn official station birthday celebration will be held on Saturday, May 4, from 1 to 5 p.m. at Red Acres Farm in Worton. The event called Tune Fest will feature live music from five area bands: Sombarkin', Justin Singleton, Phillip Dutton & the Alligators, The Good Stuff and The Blake Thompson Band. Festival goers also will enjoy a menu of offerings from local food trucks and connecting with many of the station's staff members, past and present. Tickets are $25 per person.

    "content": "Students embrace history once again in regional competition\n\n March 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ERIC SYLVIA Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 578\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS \u2014 Nearly 200 local middle and high school students participated in the annual regional history day event held once again at Chesapeake College.Organized by Queen Anne's County Public Schools teacher Thomas Hayman, the March 23 event welcomed 30 area teachers and a troupe of volunteers who hosted six schools. Schools participating in this year's event represented Caroline, Cecil, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties. This year's theme was Turning Points in History.\nProjects entered this year covered a wide range of topics, as students used a lot of creativity to make their cases.\nTopics covered included pop-culture history, topics related to women's rights and the Great Depression, as well as improvement in technology and even the advent of fast-food and its impact on history.\nThe students work hard to get to this level of the competition by first competing at the local level within their home school. The next step is this regional event, with the winners invited to participate in the Maryland statewide competition.\nAt each level, judges provide feedback the students can use to improve their project for the next competition.\nHayman says the event started as an after-school program he became involved in when he first began his teaching career. As the number of students grew, and the national event began to take shape, local programs also grew.\nEastern Shore counties previously had individual county-level events, but they decided to form a coalition in 2017 in order to be more competitive at the state level.\nThe plan worked \u2014 Hayman reports in the five years the Upper Shore Regional event has been held, two area students have gone on to compete in the national event.\nThe regional event sends the top two from each category, from each county to the state event. The state only sends the top two in each category to the national event.\nThe event is offered in conjunction with National History Day and Maryland Humanities, and it is intended to help foster a love of history in the students who participate. Students submit projects in five categories: Paper (Individual), Website, Performance, Documentary and Exhibit.\nThey can submit content as either individuals or in groups of up to five students. There are now three divisions \u2014 a youth division for students in the fifth grade, the Junior Division for students of grades six to eight and the Senior Division for students grades nine to 12.\nThe regional event is funded by Maryland Humanities, which is also responsible for hosting the state event. Hayman said Chesapeake College also played a vital role, donating the space for the exhibits, presentations and performances free of charge \u2014 a location providing a more central location than previous venues. Food trucks rounded out the day's festivities for the students.\nThese students make a choice to put in extra hours to work on their projects outside of their normal school work, Hayman said. Many of the students who participate, come back multiple years to compete, each year improving their research and presentation skills. The amount of effort and dedication these projects require rivals similar science contests.\nWhile not all participants went home with an award, the judges handed out over 50 awards to the students, including: Sports History Award, Heritage Award, Natural History Award, Military History Award, Contemporary World History Award, African American History Award, Colonial History Award, Equality in History Award, Medical History Award, and the Chesapeake Bay/Maritime Award. First, second and third place finishes as well as Best in Region awards were also given in each category. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In education, tier one instruction is instruction given to the entire classroom.\n\"Right now we see the deficit across the district as it relates to tier one instruction,\" Thompson said. \"And this is the way that we think we're going to improve our tier one instruction, by providing professional development to our leadership.\"\nThompson said the district has to put its money where its mouth is.\n\"We're trying to shift our mindset to put instruction first,\" he said. \"And we believe that this is the way to do it: By training our staff and training our leadership to be instructional leaders.\"\nThompson said Creative Leadership Solutions will cater their services to what the district needs.\nAt a Cambridge City Council meeting later that day, Thompson gave a presentation to the council on the overall picture of the school system where he talked about the need for improving tier one instruction. He spoke about the importance of having a school calendar that allows the district to provide time for professional development.\n\"We can't expect teachers to be good at their craft if we're not continuously training them to be better at their craft,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jamie Raskin's planned lecture on democracy Thursday at the University of Maryland instead turned into a lively discussion on the Israel-Hamas conflict.Raskin was invited to give the Irving and Renee Milchberg Endowed Lecture and his intended subject was \"Democracy, Autocracy and the Threat to Reason in the 21st Century.\"\n\"Progress in history requires not just reasoning, which is certainly necessary, but it's not sufficient, because it also requires the addition of the pro-social emotions, as the psychologists call it, of solidarity, empathy, love and the political virtues of justice and equality and freedom,\" Raskin said at the start of his speech.\nHis remarks were interrupted just a few minutes later by pro-Palestinian protesters shouting that Raskin is was \"complicit in genocide.\" In response, Raskin said that he wished the protesters had engaged in a conversation with him, rather than \"heckling.\"\nRaskin emphasized that he has taken a strong position on returning the hostages held by Hamas, has advocated a military ceasefire, and has championed a two-state solution. As he attempted to continue his lecture, protesters continued interrupting and shouting. Various protesters questioned Raskin's actions since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\"We need a new peace movement too, if you are the representatives of it,\" Raskin said. \"Because you're not engaging in real dialogue with people and you're not convincing anybody.\"\nProtesters supporting Israel and those backing Palestine from both sides continued heckling and arguing with each other, making it impossible for Raskin to continue. He then abandoned the speech and said he was open to taking questions from the audience, leading to more discourse among protesters.\n\"It's very tough to solve problems in the Middle East here at the University of Maryland in the physics department,\" Raskin said.\nDarryll Pines, the president of the university, later stepped in and terminated the lecture early.\n\"He came here to speak about where our democracy is going in our country,\" Pines told Capital News Service. \"What you saw play out actually was democracy and free speech and academic freedom. From our perspective as a university, there are the difficult conversations that we should be having.\"\nPines added that he wished, however, that the protesters had been more civil. He also praised Raskin's patience and empathy when responding to the protesters' comments and questions.\n\"I wanted to make a plea for constitutional patriotism in defense of democracy and freedom around the world,\" Raskin told CNS about his original speech. \"Their sentiments were perfectly consistent with a lot of what I had to say.\"\n\"I'm not really opposed to heckling,\" the congressman added. \"But it seems like heckling today is all about drowning out the speaker, and that's totally antithetical to the spirit of free expression.\"\nHoward Milchberg, University of Maryland professor of physics and electrical and computer engineering, along with his wife Rena Milchberg and their three children, started the lecture in 2019. It celebrates the memory of Howard Milchberg's late parents, who survived the Holocaust.\n\"It didn't go as planned, but it maybe turned out better than normal,\" Howard Milchberg told CNS. \"It was an actual exercise of democracy rather than a story about democracy.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Stafford, who was elected to the Board of Education in 2022, passed away in mid-December after battling cancer for several years.\nChikwendu said her first order of business as a board member is to figure out exactly where the district is right now.\n\"I mean at this point in the year, we are in the middle of budget season, we are about to end the school year,\" she said. \"At this point, it's a function of acclimating myself to just what is happening and where I'm needed.\"\nChikwendu said she wants to be of service to the community.

Rice III as its new executive director.With a deep background in outdoor education, event management, and strategic planning, Rice brings a wealth of experience and a passion for environmental education to his new role.\nRice has been an integral part of the Echo Hill Outdoor School team since 2014, serving in various capacities, including interim executive director, assistant director, senior naturalist and USCG captain.\nDuring his tenure at Echo Hill, Rice has demonstrated exceptional leadership skills in overseeing day-to-day operations, employee relations and program expansion, the outdoor school said in a press release. He has also been instrumental in building new avenues of fundraising to support the school's mission.\n\"I am honored and excited to take on the role of executive director at Echo Hill Outdoor School,\" said Rice. \"The School's program is proven \u2014 it's been around for 50 years. Statistically, for a nonprofit, that's an incredible feat. We have returning schools come year after year. But there is a lot of room to grow and reach further. I have big shoes to fill and I'm ready for the challenge.\"\nRice's dedication to outdoor education extends beyond his work at Echo Hill Outdoor School. He has previously served as associate director at Echo Hill Camp, where he played a key role in strategic planning, staff management and safety oversight.\nPrior to joining Echo Hill Camp, Rice held positions at New York Road Runners and Tough Mudder, where he gained valuable experience in event management and logistics.\nRice will serve as only the second executive director in the Echo Hill's history. Since Echo Hill Outdoor School's establishment in 1972, Rice's father, Peter Rice Jr., has led the institution until his recent retirement.\nWith a passionate board and a team of dedicated and talented staff, he developed its groundbreaking, back-to-basics environmental curriculum through educational programs that celebrated the transformative joy of nature. Under the older Rice's 51-year span of leadership, Echo Hill grew into a year-round organization, adding full time staff and educators and embarking on major capital improvements like dorms, adventure courses and a fleet of traditional Chesapeake workboats to provide on-the-water experiences.\nThe older Rice's visionary leadership in outdoor education has provided countless students with transformative outdoor experiences, instilling a lifelong love for the natural world. His commitment to education, coupled with his innovative approach, established Echo Hill Outdoor School as a cornerstone of environmental education in the region.\nThe younger Rice continues this legacy with a steadfast commitment to the School's mission \u2014 and a core belief that fun, hands-on experiences in the Chesapeake's outdoors have the power to inspire and uplift children.\n\"We are thrilled to have Petey Rice as our new Executive Director,\" said Robert Creamer, president of the Board of Directors at Echo Hill Outdoor School. \"He was selected unanimously by our search committee after a very extensive review process that drew 15 well-qualified applicants. Petey's extensive supervisory experience, his fresh ideas, his approach to fundraising, and his commitment to our mission were what we were looking for. As an executive board, we had to find the leader of Echo Hill Outdoor School for the next 50 years\u2014someone who could guide the organization through changes in education and schooling, and who could help create a culture for our staff where people feel appreciated and love to work. All of these factors made him the ideal candidate to lead our organization into the future.\"\nAs executive director, Rice will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of Echo Hill Outdoor School's operations, including staff administration, program design, fundraising and community outreach. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Though the state of Maryland wasn't on the path of totality, the moon blocked out nearly 90 percent of the sun at about 3:20 p.m. Monday over the Country School.\nTeachers prepared for the eclipse by teaching students about eclipse viewing safety and the science behind an eclipse.\nA solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, thereby obscuring the view of the sun from a small part of Earth, totally or partially.\nJean Waller Brune, acting head of school at The Country School, said preparing for the solar eclipse was wonderful.\n\"It's amazing to be here and help our students understand what a solar eclipse is and how to look at it safely,\" Brune said. \"They've all been little scientists out here, and to do it together in community as a school is just a thrill.\"\nIn science classrooms, students labeled on worksheets the eclipse process while watching a NASA live stream of the celestial event.\nAs the eclipse neared, students sat outside eagerly watching the sun through their brightly decorated eclipse masks made from colored paper plates and certified eclipse glasses.\nWhen the eclipse finally reached a moment of near totality, teachers and students alike watched in excitement as the sky darkened and the moon slowly covered the sun.\nAnn Hansen, pre-k teacher's assistant, said it meant a lot to her to share this moment with her students.\n\"They will hopefully remember this for a long time,\" Hansen said. \"It makes me so happy that we can do something like this at our school. Big events like this are just so important. It means a lot to all of us.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said he sees his students and coworkers as his family.\n\"I told my whole table, I said, 'I live down here. I don't have family down here. I don't have any children. And my students are my family, and my coworkers and my friends are my family,'\" he said.\nHillyard has taught at EHS since 2010. He is currently working to create a mentorship program for Hispanic students to support their success.\nEHS Principal Sherry Spurry said Hillyard \"branched out from the foreign language department\" this year to teach algebra after recognizing a need for support.\n\"This is just one example of Mr. Hillyard's willingness to support student success regardless of extra responsibilities or work it entails for him,\" Spurry said.\nSteele has has taught at EHS since 2018. EHS School Manager Toni Hall said Steele works \"extremely hard\" to provide support to students in math through translating, tutoring and making sure students understand the concepts. Hall said one of the greatest challenges English as a second language teachers face is having new students enter the program throughout the year.\n\"Ms. Steele is invaluable in helping these students prepare to move into algebra, a critical step in their educational journey,\" Hall said. \"She always greets new students with a smile, making them feel welcome and comfortable, and helping them learn an unfamiliar concept.\"\nRegina Coleman, school security officer at Easton Middle School, and Chanae Neal, an instructional assistant for special education at Easton Elementary School, were also finalists for the Support Staff of the Year title.\nLutisia Blessing, A pre-K teacher at White Marsh Elementary School, and Marissa Carter, a third grade math teacher at St. Michaels Elementary School, were the finalists for the Teacher of the Year title.\nHillyard congratulated his fellow finalists in his speech.\n\"I emailed them last weekend.

From lawyers, to entrepreneurs, to nurses, to educators, a wide swath of the Mid-Shore was represented at this APG Chesapeake event.The women honored at the event were selected through community nominations, with criteria like community service, professional accomplishment and personal achievement being considered. More than 200 women from the Mid-Shore region were nominated.\n\"I think it highlights all the work that everybody in the community does and just how powerful our community of women are,\" said nominee Kari Mielke Clow, principal at Chapel District Elementary.\nOf the nominees, 16 women were selected by the Women to Watch committee to be featured in this year's Women to Watch magazine, which profiles impactful work being done by women in the Mid-Shore community.\nThere were three featured speakers at the event \u2014 Ivette Furneisen, lawyer; Sharon Pepukayi, superintendent of Talbot County Public Schools; and Meisha Amia, nurse, author and entrepreneur.\nFurneisen is from Barcelona. She used her native language, Spanish, to help the Hispanic immigrant community navigate the legal system. Being from Spain, she too had to wrestle with visas, employment authorization and becoming a resident, she said. Already a lawyer in Spain when she moved to the U.S., she had to go to law school a second time to practice as a lawyer in Maryland.\n\"During COVID I had this clever idea, with a 6-month-old at my house, to go back to law school,\" she said. \"So I did it. I have been able to help a lot of people.\"\nFurneisen recently opened her law practice, Campbell and Furneisen Law Firm, in Chestertown.\nIn closing she said, \"It is on all of us to make sure the next generation of women are as strong as we are.\"\nPepukayi, who spoke after Furneisen, talked about what motivated her on her path to her position to superintendent.\nShe said she learned from the courage, confidence and communication skills of strong women who surrounded her.\n\"The courage for me to take risks, to fail forward, to laugh at my mistakes, to dust myself off and get back up when I got knocked down, to apply for jobs that I knew I would have to work really, really hard for,\" she said.\n\"The confidence to share my far-fetched ideas, to walk into a room where I was the only person that looked like me, but to know I could contribute and make a difference,\" Pepukayi continued. \"And being communicative to share my vulnerable stories, to be transparent even when it is not good news and to meet and mentor other young women\u2026 to seek to understand rather than to be understood.\"\nShe extolled the audience to help each other and to not let jealousy get in the way. She asked them to mentor younger women as they had been mentored.\nThe final speaker was Amia, a writer, labor and delivery nurse, and entrepreneur.\nAs a travel nurse with over 40 assignments, \"I treated my road trips like a 90-day evaluations on the job. I am getting things done, and I am like, 'Girl you have got to grow,'\" Amia said.\n\"The most important thing I am going to tell you today is do not be afraid to wander. Just because your path is different, it doesn't mean that you are lost. Your path is preparing you for purpose.\"\nThere were many sponsors of the event, including Easton Economic Development, Easton Utilities, Pohanka Automotive Group, Wye Financial Partners, Queenstown Landing, Shore Legal Access, Parker Counts, The Ivy, All in the Mix Bakeshop and Ruby's.\nAPG Chesapeake made a $5,000 donation to Foundation of Hope, a nonprofit organization providing cultural, spiritual, social and educational trainings to girls in middle school through an after-school program aimed at helping girls to become leaders.\n\"The event really came together early this year \u2014 we sold out a week prior,\" said Betsy Griffin, assistant regional manager for sales at APG Chesapeake. \"The speakers were fascinating and each offered snappy pieces of solid advice. How fun to watch the nominee's stand with a cheering section behind them during the event.\n\"Next year we hope to incorporate a level of mentoring for young people and are so appreciative of Foundation of Hope, as they do this type of important work,\" Griffin continued. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chesapeake College shapes Eastern Shore's future\n\n April 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CLIFFORD P. COPPERSMITH | Section: Columns \n \n 750\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The new Chesapeake College brand, launched this academic year, highlights our role in preparing our students for \"what's next.\" Our students choose their own goals \u2014 whether that is transfer to a bachelor's degree program or entry into a career \u2014 but our job is to help them acquire the relevant skills, knowledge and experiences to be successful.This role is at the heart of what our faculty, staff, and administrators do each day. We love to see our students succeed and move on to what's next in their lives. These individual successes echo throughout our community on the Eastern Shore, bolstering a vibrant economic cycle that benefits everyone in our service area.\nOur efforts yield tangible results in our community. When we empower individuals with the skills they need to succeed, we are not only transforming lives but also strengthening our local economy. A skilled workforce attracts businesses, drives innovation, and fosters economic growth. Chesapeake College is proud to be a catalyst for positive change in our community, creating pathways to prosperity for all.\nOur collaborative endeavors with partners in K-12 education, four-year institutions, local businesses, and economic leaders are crucial. This year we hosted nearly 150 of these partners at our Program Advisory Committee mixer \u2014 our largest to date. Together, we create curricula that resonate with real-world demands, ensuring both our credit and noncredit programs offer engaging and pertinent learning experiences. This collaboration is vital as we align our educational offerings with the needs of the workforce and the expectations of our community.\nThe influence of Chesapeake College graduates is unmistakable across various sectors. Once again, our nursing program boasted a 100% pass rate on the National Council of Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses. As a result of partnership with our public schools, local educators are taking classes to become certified teachers, and others are earning a childcare development associate certificate, helping to fill critical gaps for early childhood education. From health care to education, construction trades to computer science, our alumni are integral to the local workforce.\nWe recognize that not every great career requires the traditional college path. Careers in the skilled trades can be lucrative and rewarding for students, developing a broad variety of talents as well as skills in problem-solving, customer service, and communication.\nThis year, responding to the needs of local employers, Chesapeake expanded our trades offerings and launched a new advanced manufacturing program. We now have students learning the latest skills with hands-on experience using 3D printers, CNC machines, and robotics, preparing them for the high-tech jobs of tomorrow. Additionally, we continue to expand existing offerings in construction, HVAC, welding and marine services.\nOur enrollment is up 9.5% this year, continuing the growth we celebrated last year. This increase is a testament to the relevance and appeal of our programs \u2014 as well as to the impact of Maryland Blueprint for Education legislation, which expands opportunities for dual enrolled high school students. It prompts us to consider sustainable strategies for addressing the accompanying challenges, including funding and tuition adjustments, to ensure that our growth remains inclusive.\nWe continue doing our work as effectively and efficiently as possible, stewarding the critical resources provided by our state, our five support counties, and our students. As we all know, resources are tight and the state of Maryland faces challenges in funding higher education. We appreciate the support we receive from all of our funding authorities and will continue to be responsible stewards as we make every effort to serve our students and our regional community to the best of our ability.\nAs we look to the future, it's essential to recognize the challenges ahead. Access to education remains a pressing issue, with many individuals facing barriers such as financial constraints, lack of transportation, or childcare responsibilities. Addressing these challenges requires a collective effort from policymakers, community leaders, and educational institutions like Chesapeake College. We must work together to ensure that everyone has equal access to the opportunities afforded by education.\nAt Chesapeake College, we are dedicated to fostering the skills that will drive the future, preparing our students to face tomorrow's challenges with confidence and competence. Together, we are setting the stage for a thriving, prosperous future on the Eastern Shore.\nAs we continue to cultivate optimism through our actions and initiatives, I invite you to share in the vision of a promising future here at Chesapeake College \u2014 a treasure of the Eastern Shore, steadfast in its mission to empower individuals and enrich our community.\nClifford P. Coppersmith is the president of Chesapeake College. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Beyond Words brings creative and innovative opportunities to the Shore\n\n April 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TAMARA FORTE Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 887\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE \u2014 As a special education teacher and a parent to a dyslexic child, Lindsey Parte has lived through the struggles and tears of traditional education and understands firsthand the challenges that affect all types of learners.Parte has focused her 18-year teaching career on teaching struggling learners how to read. Working with students in kindergarten through high school, she is a structured literacy dyslexia specialist and certified in Orton Gillingham. Parte's mission is to increase educational resources for not only her local community \u2014 the children of the Eastern Shore \u2014 but for all children no matter where they live.\nThis is where Beyond Words Tutoring was born.\nBeyond Words Tutoring is a new educational business, located at The Edge Area on 325 Log Canoe Circle in Stevensville. It offers four innovative services: a hybrid homeschooling program, virtual dyslexia tutoring, academic summer camps, and non-attorney special education advocate services.\nThis licensed, part-time hybrid homeschooling program is creative and flexible and welcomes students ages 6 to 11.\nParte explains the program \"supports families who want to homeschool, but cannot commit to it full-time. It's the opportunity to do school and life with other families. To teach them in creative and innovative ways. It's child-led learning.\"\nThe program is three days a week Monday, Tuesday and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and will operate from Sept. 9 to May 15, 2025. The program allows for longer holiday breaks and does not follow the typical school calendar. Currently, there are 11 available spots with a small \"class\" size to allow for small group 1:1 attention.\nBeyond Words Hybrid Homeschooling Program is a microschool that is open to all learners, not just dyslexic learners. This educational alternative aims at reducing student wait time, enriching past a set of grade-level expectations, going beyond a fixed curriculum and meeting the individual's needs.\nA microschool is a non-traditional educational setting where students are learning side-by-side with learners of various ages and abilities. Think of it like a one room schoolhouse, Parte explains.\nMicroschools have become increasingly popular as families are desiring more personalized and engaging learning for their children. The students enrolled at Beyond Words Hybrid Homeschool Program are considered homeschooled students which allows parents to have more involvement in their child's education. This also means that parents are the ones responsible to meet the compulsory attendance laws under COMAR.\nThe focus of the homeschool group is math and reading. Parte said a lot of families who want to homeschool do not want to focus on being the only one teaching their child to read. She said, \"for many reasons families do not want to focus on teaching reading. It may not be in their wheelhouse, or they don't feel comfortable. So, for me to take (the reading and math) off (the parents') plate\" helps in many ways.\nBesides math and reading, the hybrid homeschool program also includes: nature, STEAM/Science Maker Space activities, arts and crafts, and kindness activities. Since the classroom location backs right up to Terrapin Nature Park, weekly activities may include nature sketching, hiking, going on adventures, forest bathing (meditative walks), community service projects and compassion circles.\nParte said she is \"huge into the mental health aspect and teaching the kids self-regulation and growth mindset.\" And stresses that she \"is building a community where the kids feel safe and comfortable. It's building a family. It is teaching them to be okay with who they are and teaching them to look out for each other and others in our community.\"\nIn order to gain a hybrid homeschooling program spot for the 2024-25 school year, there is a screening process to ensure it is a good fit for the family and the teacher. There is a curiosity form online for those interested.\nVirtual dyslexia tutoring is another offered resource. Currently these tutoring sessions utilize Orton Gillingham, are one-on-on and are individualized. Ages 6 through high school are welcome. Parte is currently tutoring middle school students as far as California, as there is a need for her specialized training everywhere.\nTutoring openings occur later at night, 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. as needed. For the 2024-25 school year, there will be nine openings for the virtual tutoring spots.\nAnother resource at Beyond Words is the academic summer camp, which prevents summer slide, or educational regression, over the summer in an atmosphere that also encourages meeting like-minded friends.\nCamp activities include math, reading, writing, STEM and more. Last year, Parte said she drove her son, Lincoln, three hours to be a part of a similar dyslexic school camp. After driving that far, Parte is excited to bring this resource closer to all those on the Eastern Shore. The camp runs from July 29 to Aug. 16 from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.\nStudents can participate in one or more of the three-week camp programs.\nThe last available service at Beyond Words Tutoring is non-attorney special education advocate services. These consulting and advocacy services empower parents to be effective advocates for their children in the Individualized Education Program process. This includes understanding the IEP documents as well as ensuring all your child's academic and behavior needs and goals are met.\nCurrently, Beyond Words Tutoring is still looking for donations of comfortable seating (like bean bags and foam seats), rugs, tables, chairs, art and crafts supplies, paper, markers, old legos, building blocks and other school supplies.\nFor more information visit www.beyondwordstutoring.com or email lindseyparte@beyondwordstutoring.com.

According to his presentation, there have been 157 attacks this year compared to 127 attacks this time last year.\n\"That is a lot of adults being attacked by students in the hallways and classrooms,\" Richardson said.\nThreats on adults are up 15% this year, from 49 threats this time last year to 56 threats this year, according to Richardson's report. Bullying and harassment is up 19% this year, with 63 incidents so far.\nFighting is down 25% this year compared to last year.

William Smallwood being a slave owner.\nJack Tuttle, a content specialist for the school system, elaborated on Smallwood's history from his findings in the Maryland state archives.\nSmallwood was born in 1732 and grew up in Charles County, and his family had already been wealthy plantation owners before his birth, Tuttle's presentation said.\nIn 1761, Smallwood became a Charles County delegate to the assembly and served in the seat for 11 years prior to the Revolutionary War.\nHe joined Charles County's committee of correspondence in 1774, which was a political organization against the British that was dedicated to spreading information, Tuttle's presentation said.\nIn 1776, Smallwood joined the Revolutionary War effort as a colonel, then eventually brigadier general of the First Maryland Regiment. He was promoted to major general based on campaigns throughout the East Coast.\nBy 1790, Smallwood owned 4,350 acres in Charles County and had 56 enslaved people working on his plantation. He served as Maryland's governor from 1785 to 1788 before he died in 1792, Tuttle said.\nCharles public school system will survey the community to garner perspective from students, staff, families, the Smallwood school feeder community, elected officials and advocacy groups on changing the school's name, Superintendent Maria Navarro said.\nNavarro proposed that all outreach would take place throughout May and early June and the results of the survey would be presented at a June board of education meeting.\nThe cost of changing the school's name could span anywhere from $64,500 to $124,500, with most of the variance coming from the type of sign the school chooses, according to Tuttle and Navarro's presentation. A traditional sign would cost about $10,000, while an LED digital sign would cost upward of $70,000.\nOther potential costs include $35,000 for exterior school lettering, $3,000 for school graphic window film, $10,000 for school plaques, $1,000 for school banners and $5,500 for athletic uniforms.\nNavarro reminded board members of Board Policy 7230, which states that a vote to rename the school cannot be held until at least three intervening school board meetings after notification to the school's community. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One by one, students were moved throughout the kitchen and shown the behind-the-scenes of sweet treats and rich desserts.\nJulia Foxwell, director of community engagement for Bluepoint Hospitality, said it was a delight for the chefs to share their passion for sweets with the students.\n\"We have been working with the Chesapeake Multicultural Center for some time on how best to support their initiatives while also providing enriching experiences to their students,\" Foxwell said. \"Bringing the girls and boys in to learn kitchen basics \u2014 from prep to final product \u2014 exposes them to new concepts, flavors and perhaps a future passion of their own. Chefs (Harley) Peet and Heim loved hosting the kids in the kitchen and even got a few ideas for new flavors.\"\nVictoria Gomez Lozano, Hispanic outreach coordinator for Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said this program is important in reaching out to community members who may not know about the center's services.\n\"We started this program to give the underserved children of this community the opportunity to have extracurricular activities and to be exposed to a lot of things that they may not have the opportunity to,\" Gomez Lozano said. \"It's also a good way to contact their parents and the families in the community as well so they can open up to us and so we can give them our services.\"\nAt the end of the tour, every student was given a scoop of ice cream and a choice of toppings to create their own flavor.\nEach student enjoyed the ice cream while laughing with friends.\nStudent Yerelin Fuentes said she has been in the after-school program for a few years now and loves the chance to learn new things and spend time with her friends outside of class. But what she loves most, she said, is the ability to learn to be a good person.\n\"They show us how to be a hero,\" Fuentes said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Job opportunities, money available for graduates\n\n April 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPHEN RIDEOUT | Section: Columns \n \n 533\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n These past few weeks have brought me information that I want to share with you about what the Maryland government has available for job possibilities for your graduating high school senior or one who graduated within the past few years and scholarship opportunities for your child, grandchild or possibly even you who are in mid-life or mid-career and are thinking about making a change.I will first take up possible job opportunities for a child or grandchild. This is for someone who is not thinking about college right now or has not gone out looking for a job or has but has no immediate prospects.\nMaryland has created the Department of Service and Civic Innovation that can be found at dsci.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx. If you are a business or nonprofit organization or run a local government, you can sign up to be a host site for graduating seniors or former high school graduates where they can work for a year with the state paying a minimum salary of $15 an hour and health insurance being provided along with $6,000 being set aside for higher education.\nIf you are a young person with no or unsure plans on what you are going to do after graduation or have graduated and do not have a job, you can sign up and find a position where you might be able to work. Work sites have to sign up by May 1 for this group of young people to work and youth have until later in May to sign up. It is a great opportunity for the community, businesses and nonprofits to help our youth build their abilities to work, be mentored and meet other young people from all over the state.\nThis year there were no youth from Dorchester County that applied for a job through this program.\nWith regard to scholarships, earlier this week I learned at a community meeting held by Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) about the Commission on Higher Education. Derrick Colley came and spoke about all of the money that is available through the state for higher education for youth, adults, people who work for the state or local governments and others. The link to that website is mhec.maryland.gov/about/pages/contactus.aspx. I also learned that all of our state delegates and senators have money available themselves for financial aid to students, and they can seek that help by contacting the legislators' offices to learn more.\nThe most interesting and unfortunate thing that I learned about these resources is that every year there is money left over and not used because not enough people seek the assistance.\nI also learned from the conversation among those attending Sample-Hughes' meeting that many of our youth are not motivated to fill out the online application forms and that the way many who attended had to do it was to sit their young family member in front of the computer and help them through the process.\nIf you are reading this and want to help yourself or a family member, go to both websites first and learn more about them and then find that person who needs a job or a scholarship and sit down with them and help them get started.\nStephen Rideout is mayor of Cambridge. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Candidates compete for 3 open Dorchester Board of Education seats\n\n April 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 3224\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Dorchester County Board of Education has three position on the ballot this year for Districts 1, 3 and 5. There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 1 and 5 will appear on the ballot of May 14's primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election. The District 3 candidates will not be on the ballot until November, since only two candidates are registered.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the eight candidates competing for the seats to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity and length. Extended versions of these Q&As are available at stardem.com.\nMIKE HARTFORDMike Hartford is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nFirst-hand knowledge from a parent standpoint on current issues. Outside perspective, from not only a parental standpoint, but from a business standpoint. As a small business owner I feel I have the tools necessary to communicate issues effectively and provide reasonable solutions when problems do arise.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nWe need to focus more on our local needs and suggestions, rather than what the state suggests. Our county is run by the students and the parents. The current board needs to be aware of that. It is about the kids, always.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nMaryland's Blueprint itself is a great concept. We need to adapt to these guidelines and utilize the tools and knowledge we have of our local community to expand the idea further. For Instance, teacher incentives, pay raises and teacher appreciation should be at the forefront of our focus. These are the people who guide the students in the right direction. We need to attract the best talent so we can provide the children the best education they can get. Our country's future depends on it.\nCHRISTINE LAMONICAChristine LaMonica is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a prospective member of the Board of Education, I bring a commitment to fostering positive change and ensuring that every student receives the best possible education in a safe environment.\nI bring a true passion for advocacy for our students, families, and educators to ensure that their voices are heard, and their needs are met within our educational system. This will include advocating for resources for all schools regardless of their socioeconomic status or location, as I believe in the power of inclusive education that celebrates diversity and promotes a sense of belonging for every student.\nAs a board member I would promote transparency and collaboration in decision making. I am looking forward to visiting the schools and listening to the needs of each district, I believe that is paramount in understanding the culture of our schools. I recognize that to make progress, the Board functions best when the members work together towards common goals with open communication and respect.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward? How do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nI am going to combine this question along with the question regarding the Blueprint. Overall, the board and district should work together towards the common goal of student safety, success in learning, and wellness for all students first and foremost, the Blueprint hopefully being a roadmap to help us meet certain objectives.\nAs a candidate and community member I see the Blueprint as a \"challenge,\" and one that has the potential to bring good to our schools, albeit nothing is perfect or easy. As a candidate I think the county and the board are addressing the issues of funding and staffing regarding the requirements of the Blueprint and the future of our education system the best they can right now with the resources available to them. The county and the board are going to have to be creative and resilient with the challenges ahead. We aren't alone or singled out in Dorchester County. Larger counties are facing challenges also. They may have more resources to pull from, but larger populations to serve. We all have our specific barriers to overcome. We see this not only in the education system, but in many public service arenas.\nLUCAS THORPELucas Thorpe is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a candidate for the Board of Education, I bring a unique blend of experience, passion, and dedication to student success. Having previously served as a student member on the board, I understand the inner workings of the education system and the challenges that students face firsthand. This experience has equipped me with valuable insights into the needs and aspirations of our student population.\nIn addition to my board experience, my current work in the nonprofit sector serving Dorchester County Public Schools students has further deepened my understanding of the issues affecting our educational system. Through my role, I have developed innovative programs and initiatives aimed at supporting student growth and achievement.\nI am committed to fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and excellence within the board. My goal is to ensure that every decision made reflects a student-first mindset and contributes to the overall improvement of our educational system.\nFurthermore, I am dedicated to promoting innovation and equity in education. I will work tirelessly to advocate for resources and programs that empower all students to reach their full potential, regardless of their background or circumstances.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe goals that the board and district need to be working toward are multifaceted and require a comprehensive approach to address the challenges facing Dorchester County Public Schools. First and foremost, we need to prioritize improving academic outcomes and student achievement. Currently, DCPS is ranked 23 out of 24 systems in the state of Maryland, which is unacceptable. We must work tirelessly to elevate our educational standards and ensure that every student receives a high-quality education that prepares them for success.\nTo achieve this goal, we need to focus on several key areas:\nLeadership and support.Parent and community involvement.Addressing chronic absenteeism.Discipline and behavioral remediation.College and career readiness.\nThe board and district need to prioritize academic excellence, foster parent and community involvement, address chronic absenteeism and discipline issues, and promote college and career readiness.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nAs a law passed in the Maryland State Legislature, my stance on the Blueprint is clear: I fully support its objectives and initiatives.\nNow, the conversation shifts to how our school system will implement and stay on track with what is outlined in the Blueprint.\nOne key aspect of the Blueprint that I strongly endorse is Pillar 2, which focuses on high quality and diverse teachers and leaders. This pillar mandates that local school systems implement new teacher ladders, including a minimum teacher salary of $60,000 by fiscal year 2026. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of partnering with Historically Black Colleges and Universities to increase and support the pipeline of diverse teachers and leaders. Increasing teacher pay is essential for Dorchester to remain competitive and attract top talent to our schools.\nHowever, it's important to note that while I fully support the Blueprint, it is not currently fully funded by the State of Maryland. Despite a budget surplus in fiscal year 2023, the state is projected to face a structural budget deficit of $761 million by fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2024, DCPS received $58,118,000 in direct state funding and $24,006,038 in funding from the county. Historically, our county commissioners have funded education locally at around 0.0-1.0% above the Maintenance of Effort, whereas neighboring Wicomico County funds at roughly 5.0-10.0% above the MOE. As leaders in the school system and the county council, it's imperative that we collaborate to find ways to fully fund initiatives and programming efforts locally.\nSUSAN MORGANSusan Morgan is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Morgan is the current Board of Education vice president.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nRaise the academic performance of all students in every school, with a particular focus on reading and math.Make kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.Reduce chronic absenteeism.Implement an effective alternative education program to address disruptive behavior at every level.Refuse to accept violent behavior by imposing serious and predictable consequences on such behavior.Increase fiscal responsibility and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe Board of Education is directing DCPS to implement the Blueprint requirements within the required timelines. However, sufficient funding to meet these mandated requirements is not being provided by the State of Maryland. Lack of adequate funding will require hard, but informed choices over the next several years. Unless increased funding is provided or implementation deadlines are modified, it may impossible to meet Blueprint requirements going forward.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have worked constructively with all individuals and groups who have the success of our students as their goal. For example, Mike Diaz (2023-24 Board President, 2022-23 Vice President) and I (2022-23 President, 2023-24 Vice President) have markedly different political views, but we have worked extremely well together to generate the constructive change needed for our children to succeed. Actions of the Board under our leadership over the past two years have resulted in the following accomplishments:\nStudent Achievement: The Board is now monitoring student achievement using structured reports prepared by the DCPS Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessments. As a result, we now have reliable data demonstrating that our students' test scores are improving somewhat is some areas.Kindergarten Readiness: Importantly, 42.4% of students enrolled in pre-kindergarten programs demonstrate readiness for kindergarten. Overall Kindergarten readiness has improved with 39% of students demonstrating readiness in Fall of SY2023-2024 (versus 32% in SY2022-2023 and 29% in SY2021-2022).Programs to Address Disruptive Behavior: This year, the Board has finally implemented a structured alternative education program that includes both academic and social/emotional components (with both an on-campus and an off-campus high school program) that is showing measurable results. Functional Family Therapy delivered in the student's home is an important component of this program. A request for proposals to develop and implement similar on-campus programs at the elementary and middle school levels has been posted.Increased Fiscal Responsibility and Accountability: Over the past two years, the Board President and Vice President have initiated increased scrutiny of budget development and detailed justifications of spending requests. The Board now requires that concrete performance and outcome measures be specified for funded programs and for contracts with external organizations. In preparation for SY 2024-25, we are going back to the basics with our budget. Every dollar is being scrutinized, including costs of maintenance, function, administration and teachers. Costs have often been carried over from year-to-year without evaluation.School Safety: School safety has been improved demonstrably. We have supplied all of our secondary schools with weapons detection systems and installed fences around many of our schools. In addition, the board now refuses to accept violent behavior and is willing to impose serious and predictable consequences for violent behavior.Website Redesign: Comments from users indicated that the previous DCPS website failed to provide important information, was difficult to navigate, and lacked effective mechanisms for getting information out to the community. The Board directed DCPS to develop a new website that would incorporate an integrated communication system to address these deficiencies. After much discussion and review, the new website and communication system were installed and became operational this year.Increased Communication with the County Council:The board president and vice president have met regularly with the president and vice president of the County Council to foster an understanding of DCPS needs and programs and to address wider areas of concern, such as juvenile justice challenges.\nMIKE DIAZMike Diaz is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Diaz is the current Board of Education president.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe board (5 elected individuals), are intensely focused on the areas described above. The Board members working with the superintendent are highly focused on retention and accountability within the system. As with any large company, or in our case school district, change doesn't occur over night and neither do results. I feel we are moving rapidly in the right direction.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nOur job as the duly elected members to the school district is to govern the district and work with the superintendent. He manages the district and, specifically, the Blueprint requirements. The county government provides us the Maintenance of Effort funding to which we and the superintendent account for in the budget. This funding accounts for roughly 20% of the DCPS budget.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI was elected in 2020 and, shortly after taking office, the pandemic occurred, slowing everything down. That being said, I ran on safety and security and accountability as my main focus. Since then we added a layered security apparatus that involves weapon detection systems, security camera upgrades, security vestibules, etc. We had the superintendent hire a director of security and an assistant superintendent to focus on safety and accountability directly in the schools.\nAlternative Education at the secondary level was something I wanted to ensure was available to the district when these students displayed undesirable behaviors and were, in most cases, sent home or suspended long term. Although DCPS by law still has to provide them educational services, many students never completed those tasks and were in the community being unaccountable. Making the investment in alternative education now ensures that there is a program in place in each high school for students that are experiencing difficulty in their normal setting.\nStudents that are placed on long term suspension are asked to participate in the off-campus alternative education program in Woolford and are there for an average of 44 days. This is in collaboration with the student and the parents. Many of the students are also given the opportunity to participate in the Functional Family Therapy program that is also offered as an intensive in-home wrap-around service.\nI can't think of a better example of the term \"equity\" than this. Providing structural, long-term, evidenced-based services to our most at risk populations.\nThis Board also approved a three year agreement with the educators, increasing their compensation to meet the Blueprint standards.\nThe overall goal is to provide the community the best education possible. DCPS is currently 23 out of 24 in Maryland, something the acting superintendent reminds us of frequently. We didn't get here overnight. I feel more confident that we are charging ahead with the mentality of accountability at all levels. This approach will shape the management and leadership culture in the district and will have a direct effect in the learning process.\nBRANDY DAWSON CUMBERLANDBrandy Dawson Cumberland is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nA fresh perspective as a parent and invested community member, without a private agenda. I have studied and implemented quality initiative projects throughout my doctoral studies. I am serious about safe, evidence-based and data-driven solutions while remembering the uniqueness and diversity of our large school district. Additionally, as a mental health professional, I aim to serve our community, and the future of our community is our children.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nGoals must prioritize safety, transparency, learning, retaining quality educators and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nWhile the Blueprint has been passed at the state level, several districts are in a similar situation to Dorchester. We must continue working with local and state legislators to advocate for resource allocation to allow for implementation.\nCHRIS WEEDLETONChris Wheedleton is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. He is currently serving as District 5 board member.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe board and district leadership established and aligned on a strategic plan last year that lays out clear goals for improvement and growth. Those goals were translated into scorecards and metrics in every area of the strategic plan including academic success, school/family/community partnerships, school safety & climate, high quality workforce and operational efficiency. We have shifted the monthly board meetings to put student outcomes and deliverables in each area at the forefront of what we focus on and post the outcomes on the DCPS website after every meeting to ensure transparency and clarity for all community stakeholders. Continuous improvement in every one of those areas is what the district needs to and is working towards. Check out the plan at: https://www.dcps.k12.md.us/o/dcps/page/parents\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nIn an honest and open way. That includes how we are working to understand and stay compliant with the guidelines that have been and continue to be laid out from the state, which we are currently doing through our Blueprint coordinator, Dr. Boyd. It also includes sharing with all stakeholders what is working and not working for our District and community. There are multiple elements of Blueprint that need to be refined in order for it to help support the unique needs of Dorchester County. The board and superintendent continue to share those with state and local officials so that they understand, from the educator's perspective, what the implementation looks like on the ground. Working together to understand and try to improve what is needed for our county is important. There are positive aspects that have brought resources in the area of workforce development and career planning for students, as well as areas like early childhood that have yet to be structured in ways that work in Dorchester County.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have enjoyed the work of the board and appreciate the feedback I have received that community members have seen my approach as organized and thoughtful to the questions and work that comes before the Board for consideration and action. I am proud to have added value in helping to develop and steer the publicly available Data Dashboard and the process behind it, clearer connections to the business community, and a reinstated CASE Agricultural program at DCTC to ensure that exposure to pathways to success in agriculture remain a viable part of the educational experience for students in our community. One clear goal ahead is the critical work of finding the best next leader of DCPS as part of the superintendent search process that we are currently going through, and I am honored to be helping to lead that process. I would be proud to represent the area of Dorchester County in District 5 that raised me.

As a community we continue to face evolving challenges, these challenges look different in each district. I am prepared to serve our community's public schools and assist in ensuring that the school districts are responsive to these challenges and receptive to the values and priorities of its community members.\nIn addition, as a prospective board member, it is my desire for our children and educators to be set up for success. I plan to use my commitment to public service and my personal and professional experiences to assist with solutions, ideas, and decisions. I firmly believe it is time for Dorchester County Public Schools to start rising to the top and to exceed expectations.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a prospective member of the Board of Education, I bring a commitment to fostering positive change and ensuring that every student receives the best possible education in a safe environment.\nI bring a true passion for advocacy for our students, families, and educators to ensure that their voices are heard, and their needs are met within our educational system.

I recognize that to make progress, the Board functions best when the members work together towards common goals with open communication and respect.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nWe have many important issues, all requiring attention. However, as a parent with children in the school system, and as a public safety professional in Dorchester County, I personally believe we need to start our new school year off creating a safer school environment for everyone. Safe schools foster successful learning. This goes beyond more school resource officers and weapon detection systems. This includes addressing the root cause of violence and insecurity in the community by advocating for safe schools with a holistic approach that addresses social, emotional and environmental factors that impact our students.\nThis issue as well as many others require commitment, collaboration (one of my favorite words) and action to ensure our schools are nurturing and safe environments where our students can thrive for success. We can achieve this with more wraparound services and consistency in planning and implementing.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward? How do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nI am going to combine this question along with the question regarding the Blueprint. Overall, the board and district should work together towards the common goal of student safety, success in learning, and wellness for all students first and foremost, the Blueprint hopefully being a roadmap to help us meet certain objectives.\nAs a candidate and community member I see the Blueprint as a \"challenge,\" and one that has the potential to bring good to our schools, albeit nothing is perfect or easy. As a candidate I think the county and the board are addressing the issues of funding and staffing regarding the requirements of the Blueprint and the future of our education system the best they can right now with the resources available to them. The county and the board are going to have to be creative and resilient with the challenges ahead. We aren't alone or singled out in Dorchester County. Larger counties are facing challenges also. They may have more resources to pull from, but larger populations to serve. We all have our specific barriers to overcome. We see this not only in the education system, but in many public service arenas.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nThese numbers tell me that we have work to do. We need those numbers to rise, not only because they are statistics to boast about, but because we want our young students to do well so they can be successful learners. Our educators and support staff that I personally have worked alongside are giving what they can and then some. There is no simple solution, however this is where I think the Blueprint has some promise to help us navigate through some of these difficulties. It just has pieces and parts that are difficult for Dorchester County to achieve for many reasons.\nThe district has its work cut out for it, and so does the board. But as a community, we also have work to do. It takes a village. We need to come together with transparency and a willingness to listen without any personal agendas. As a candidate, I am ready to work with other board members, community leaders and stakeholders to move us forward.\nSUSAN MORGAN\nSusan Morgan is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Morgan is the current Board of Education vice president.\nWhy are you running?\nDriving change has not been easy. More work is needed to bring about the changes that our children need and deserve. DCPS still faces tremendous challenges.\nDCPS students score next-to-last in the State on every academic measure.\nIncoming students lack social, emotional and academic readiness.\nChronic absenteeism remains a significant impediment to achievement.\nDisruptive behavior too often impedes learning and threatens student and teacher safety.\nBudget reductions will require hard, but informed choices over the next several years.\nWithout a strong, improved school system, our community will never attract the young families and businesses that are that are critical to future success.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nMy top priority going forward is to raise the academic performance of all students in every school, with a particular focus on reading and math. The Board is now monitoring student achievement using structured reports prepared by the DCPS Director of Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessments. As a result, we now have reliable data demonstrating that our students' test scores are improving somewhat is some areas. However, unacceptably large percentages of our students in every grade score below grade level in reading and math. Chronic absenteeism remains a significant impediment to achievement. More effective interventions are needed that dedicate time EVERY DAY to reading and math.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nRaise the academic performance of all students in every school, with a particular focus on reading and math.\nMake kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.\nReduce chronic absenteeism.\nImplement an effective alternative education program to address disruptive behavior at every level.\nRefuse to accept violent behavior by imposing serious and predictable consequences on such behavior.\nIncrease fiscal responsibility and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe Board of Education is directing DCPS to implement the Blueprint requirements within the required timelines. However, sufficient funding to meet these mandated requirements is not being provided by the State of Maryland. Lack of adequate funding will require hard, but informed choices over the next several years. Unless increased funding is provided or implementation deadlines are modified, it may impossible to meet Blueprint requirements going forward.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nImportantly, 42.4% of students enrolled in pre-kindergarten programs demonstrate readiness for kindergarten. Overall Kindergarten readiness has improved with 39% of students demonstrating readiness in Fall of SY2023-2024 (versus 32% in SY2022-2023 and 29% in SY2021-2022) We need to make kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have worked constructively with all individuals and groups who have the success of our students as their goal. For example, Mike Diaz (2023-24 Board President, 2022-23 Vice President) and I (2022-23 President, 2023-24 Vice President) have markedly different political views, but we have worked extremely well together to generate the constructive change needed for our children to succeed. Actions of the Board under our leadership over the past two years have resulted in the following accomplishments:\nStudent Achievement.Progress \u2013 The Board is now monitoring student achievement using structured reports prepared by the DCPS Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessments. As a result, we now have reliable data demonstrating that our students' test scores are improving somewhat is some areas.Priority \u2013 Unacceptably large percentages of our students in every grade score below grade level in reading and math. Chronic absenteeism remains a significant impediment to achievement. More effective interventions are needed.Kindergarten Readiness.Progress \u2013 Importantly, 42.4% of students enrolled in pre-kindergarten programs demonstrate readiness for kindergarten. Overall Kindergarten readiness has improved with 39% of students demonstrating readiness in Fall of SY2023-2024 (versus 32% in SY2022-2023 and 29% in SY2021-2022).Priority \u2013 We need to make kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.Programs to Address Disruptive Behavior.Progress \u2013 This year, the Board has finally implemented a structured alternative education program that includes both academic and social/emotional components (with both an on-campus and an off-campus high school program) that is showing measurable results. Functional Family Therapy delivered in the student's home is an important component of this program. A request for proposals to develop and implement similar on-campus programs at the elementary and middle school levels has been posted.Priority \u2013 Implementation of these intervention programs is critical to ensuring students' academic progress and behavioral control. These programs must be flexible enough to address individual student needs, and must be based on a written Functional Behavioral Assessment, supported by a concrete, individualized Behavioral Intervention Plan.Increased Fiscal Responsibility and Accountability.Progress \u2013 Over the past two years, the Board President and Vice President have initiated increased scrutiny of budget development and detailed justifications of spending requests. The Board now requires that concrete performance and outcome measures be specified for funded programs and for contracts with external organizations. In preparation for SY 2024-25, we are going back to the basics with our budget. Every dollar is being scrutinized, including costs of maintenance, function, administration and teachers. Costs have often been carried over from year-to-year without evaluation.Priority \u2013 The practice of continuing programs without evaluation must stop, and programs that cannot demonstrate effectiveness must be eliminated in favor of programs that can. Budget reductions will require hard, but informed choices going forward.School Safety.Progress \u2013 School safety has been improved demonstrably. We have supplied all of our secondary schools with weapons detection systems and installed fences around many of our schools. In addition, the board now refuses to accept violent behavior and is willing to impose serious and predictable consequences for violent behavior.Priority \u2013 Violent students may be offered appropriate voluntary educational programs outside DCPS, but violence can not be accepted on any DCPS campus. Consequences for violent behavior must continue to be clear and consistently enforced.Website Redesign.Progress \u2013 Comments from users indicated that the previous DCPS website failed to provide important information, was difficult to navigate, and lacked effective mechanisms for getting information out to the community. The Board directed DCPS to develop a new website that would incorporate an integrated communication system to address these deficiencies. After much discussion and review, the new website and communication system were installed and became operational this year.Priority \u2013 The website must be maintained and updated in a timely and user-friendly manner.Increased Communication with the County Council.Progress \u2013 The board president and vice president have met regularly with the president and vice president of the County Council to foster an understanding of DCPS needs and programs and to address wider areas of concern, such as juvenile justice challenges.Priority \u2013 Increased communication with the County Council must be maintained and strengthened. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Three candidates compete for District 5 Dorchester Board of Education seat\n\n May 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Dorchester County Board of Education has three position on the ballot this year for Districts 1, 3 and 5. There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 5 will appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election in November.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the candidates competing for the District 5 seat to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity.\nCHRIS WEEDLETON\nChris Wheedleton is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. He is currently serving as District 5 board member.\nWhy are you running?\nI was honored to be appointed last year by the County Council to represent District 5, based on the experiences and skills that I have built working in education and workforce development innovations across the country over the last several decades. I have enjoyed the process of collaborating with the board and community stakeholders to align our resources and find solutions to improve opportunities and outcomes for our students, educators and schools. I feel like I have added value and see the opportunity to help make further improvements. I would like to continue that work for a full term.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThere are many needs and challenges that we face as a community and school district. Among the most important issues currently is the need to have a clear sense for where we are and where we need to go as a school system, and a consistent culture across the system and in each school for accountability and working together to find the best solutions. The current process for finding the best next leader for DCPS is an important part of that, and the board is starting with direct engagement with the community to get the voice of all stakeholders as part of this process. I believe that having a culture that brings all resources that we have as a collective community to help create the best conditions for our students to find success, is among the most important issues we face right now and into the future.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe board and district leadership established and aligned on a strategic plan last year that lays out clear goals for improvement and growth. Those goals were translated into scorecards and metrics in every area of the strategic plan including academic success, school/family/community partnerships, school safety & climate, high quality workforce and operational efficiency. We have shifted the monthly board meetings to put student outcomes and deliverables in each area at the forefront of what we focus on and post the outcomes on the DCPS website after every meeting to ensure transparency and clarity for all community stakeholders. Continuous improvement in every one of those areas is what the district needs to and is working towards. Check out the plan at: https://www.dcps.k12.md.us/o/dcps/page/parents\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nIn an honest and open way. That includes how we are working to understand and stay compliant with the guidelines that have been and continue to be laid out from the state, which we are currently doing through our Blueprint coordinator, Dr. Boyd. It also includes sharing with all stakeholders what is working and not working for our District and community. There are multiple elements of Blueprint that need to be refined in order for it to help support the unique needs of Dorchester County. The board and superintendent continue to share those with state and local officials so that they understand, from the educator's perspective, what the implementation looks like on the ground. Working together to understand and try to improve what is needed for our county is important. There are positive aspects that have brought resources in the area of workforce development and career planning for students, as well as areas like early childhood that have yet to be structured in ways that work in Dorchester County.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nThere are so many positive improvements happening across our community, and the collective impact of community partners is starting show real results, in concert with the leadership of DCPS. It is no accident that the timing of these improvements comes in the second year of a 10 year comprehensive plan as part of the Campaign for Grade-Level Reading that was started in Dorchester County by a wide range of community partners. This has included nonprofits, business partners and action agencies including Moving Dorchester Forward, the Health Department, the Chamber of Commerce, the library system, the YMCA, Boys & Girls Clubs and United Way. Much of this was started through the leadership of the John & Janice Wyatt Foundation. DCPS is a key leader in this effort through the Early Childhood Advisory Council. The more that we can bring EVERYONE together in this collective effort, the more we will see continued progress. Learn more at: https://www.dorchestercglr.com/\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have enjoyed the work of the board and appreciate the feedback I have received that community members have seen my approach as organized and thoughtful to the questions and work that comes before the Board for consideration and action. I am proud to have added value in helping to develop and steer the publicly available Data Dashboard and the process behind it, clearer connections to the business community, and a reinstated CASE Agricultural program at DCTC to ensure that exposure to pathways to success in agriculture remain a viable part of the educational experience for students in our community. One clear goal ahead is the critical work of finding the best next leader of DCPS as part of the superintendent search process that we are currently going through, and I am honored to be helping to lead that process. I would be proud to represent the area of Dorchester County in District 5 that raised me. I welcome anyone who wants to learn more to check out my website at: https://skillsgap.org/welcome\nMIKE HARTFORD\nMike Hartford is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhy are you running?\nMy main focus is keeping our current schools in place. The last few years have been challenging for the current students, board and parents. We need to be sure parents have a true say in what is happening and a place to have their questions answered. I'm running to bring transparency to the current issues at hand and to keep the parents well informed in not only our district, but our county. Its time the younger generation stands up and starts making the changes they wish to see.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nFirst-hand knowledge from a parent standpoint on current issues. Outside perspective, from not only a parental standpoint, but from a business standpoint. As a small business owner I feel I have the tools necessary to communicate issues effectively and provide reasonable solutions when problems do arise.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe infrastructure of certain schools. We need to explore all options that work for the parents, not just the budget. We have schools that have been standing in low-lying areas creating common problems that if fixed, could potentially save the small communities around them. These communities make our county great, if we remove the school(s), we not only face logistical nightmares for parents, grandparents and siblings. We need reasonable solutions that the parents of the students who attend the schools can come to an agreement on.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nWe need to focus more on our local needs and suggestions, rather than what the state suggests. Our county is run by the students and the parents. The current board needs to be aware of that. It is about the kids, always.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nMaryland's Blueprint itself is a great concept. We need to adapt to these guidelines and utilize the tools and knowledge we have of our local community to expand the idea further. For Instance, teacher incentives, pay raises and teacher appreciation should be at the forefront of our focus. These are the people who guide the students in the right direction. We need to attract the best talent so we can provide the children the best education they can get. Our country's future depends on it.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nWhile trending in the right direction, we need to keep the momentum. Providing parents of toddlers and childcare workers educational supplies and online classes to further their skills could potentially be beneficial. The parents/daycare providers could use these supplies/skills to ensure our young children are mentally, physically and emotionally ready for their big transition. The current pk-3 option we are bringing into the 2024-2025 school year is a great idea, but at what expense?\nJEROME HARRIS\nJerome Harris is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Harris did not respond to the candidate questions. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Truly it takes a village. I want to be able to recognize the people in the village that helped us do the jobs that we can do. We can't do it alone, isolated, as a school district,\" said TCSP Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi during her opeing remarks. \"We are super excited to shine a light on those community partners that helped us. Each school selects one community partner that has helped them throughout the year. As I like to say it is a handshake, not a handout.\"\nThe TCPS dance program performed by Beyond the Steps stole the show and got big applause for their energetic performance to Pharrell Williams' \"Happy.\" Afterwards, awards were presented to community partners.\nEach school in the district chose one partner to uplift.\nTalbot County Public School District chose the Talbot County Public Library to honor.\n\"We selected them because we always come up with ideas and the people from the library are like sure we will do it. Like for example popsicles in the park. Anything we want to do, they are like, 'Call us and we will help out,'\" Pepukayi said.\nShe also made sure to \"Give a super shout out to the Talbot County Education Foundation. They are the group that supports our teachers in the classroom when they have ideas. They help fund those innovative ideas and projects that teachers want to do.\"\nDr. Lisa Devaric, principal of Easton Elementary School, said, \"We are recognizing Rack Room Shoes. They have a program where people buy shoes and a percentage goes into a shoe fund for our school. We are at about 78% free and reduced meals. So close to eight out of ten of our students are living at or below the line of poverty line.\"\nShe said that community school program manager Katie Fox knows what style, color and size the students need and uses the funds to buy shoes for them.\n\"We want to provide more than academics. We want to improve the quality of life for our students looking at mental health, access to nutritional foods, wraparound care,\" Devaric said.\nDebbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools, introduced the schools and their partners one by one.\nFirst was Kari Clow, principal of Chapel District Elementary School, who chose Second Chance Thrift Shop. Easton Middle School chose Foundation of Hope. Easton High School chose Harbor Freight Tools. St. Michaels Middle High School chose Donnie and Shelley Gowe. St. Michaels Elementary chose the St. Michaels Fire Department.\nTilghman Elementary chose Tilghman Methodist Church. White Marsh Elementary chose Mamma Maria's and the Coffee Trappe. TCPS Internship Program chose iFrog Marketing Solutions. The Early Learning Department and the Judy Center chose Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers.\nThe closing remarks were made by Emily Jackson, president of the Talbot County Board of Education.\n\"I am so blown away by what I have seen today. Our community is truly amazing. Thank you all for everything you do every day. Your unwavering support is the backbone of our schools, and you empower us to create meaningful experiences for our students,\" Jackson said.\nShe thanked the culinary arts students, Linda Brown and Joseph Candel for making breakfast. She also thanked the TCPS Education Foundation for sponsoring the whole event.\n\"It is about recognizing the spirit of collaboration and the unity that defines us as a community. Whether it is volunteering your time, providing resources or lending your expertise each of you and your contributions makes a real difference in the lives of our students,\" Jackson said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 1 will appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election in November.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the candidates competing for the District 1 seat to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity.\nBRANDY DAWSON CUMBERLAND\nBrandy Dawson Cumberland is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhy are you running?\nI was approached about becoming a candidate after the community became concerned about the lack of transparency when several schools were proposed to be shut down. As a life-long resident of my district, and with four children of my own, I was passionate about saving our schools, especially our rural schools.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nA fresh perspective as a parent and invested community member, without a private agenda. I have studied and implemented quality initiative projects throughout my doctoral studies. I am serious about safe, evidence-based and data-driven solutions while remembering the uniqueness and diversity of our large school district. Additionally, as a mental health professional, I aim to serve our community, and the future of our community is our children.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nProviding the fundamentals essential for students is the most important issue in DCPS. Teachers and students need safe classrooms. We must engage those surrounding our students, in the family and community, and address local and state policies to prioritize each individual's safety in a DCPS building and bus.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nGoals must prioritize safety, transparency, learning, retaining quality educators and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nWhile the Blueprint has been passed at the state level, several districts are in a similar situation to Dorchester. We must continue working with local and state legislators to advocate for resource allocation to allow for implementation.\nAccording to DCPS data, Kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nImprovement in kindergarten readiness is positive for Dorchester County and is approaching the Maryland average. Going forward the district must continue to utilize evidence-based practice within the curriculum with allotment for additional resources as needed.\nMIKE DIAZ\nMike Diaz is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Diaz is the current Board of Education president.\nWhy are you running?\nI'm running for re-election to continue the work that I started in my first term, which will be outlined in the following responses.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nIn my opinion, the most important issues facing DCPS are as follows and not in order of importance: safety and security, retention and recruitment of highly qualified teachers, alternative education and an intensive reading program at the elementary level.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe board (5 elected individuals), are intensely focused on the areas described above. The Board members working with the superintendent are highly focused on retention and accountability within the system. As with any large company, or in our case school district, change doesn't occur over night and neither do results. I feel we are moving rapidly in the right direction.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nOur job as the duly elected members to the school district is to govern the district and work with the superintendent. He manages the district and, specifically, the Blueprint requirements. The county government provides us the Maintenance of Effort funding to which we and the superintendent account for in the budget. This funding accounts for roughly 20% of the DCPS budget.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nThe district has been intensely focused on primary education. Although there are promising gains in this area, we have a long way to go. There are many reasons for the primary education gap. Many children, especially in our Title I schools, show up already far behind the standard and become frustrated in the classroom. Many times this results in emotional outbursts which requires them to be removed from that setting or sent home. This is a failing strategy and only widens the learning gap. As we already have alternative education for special education students and high school students, we asked the district to submit RFP's for elementary education. These programs will keep children in school learning and, over time, produce structural change.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI was elected in 2020 and, shortly after taking office, the pandemic occurred, slowing everything down. That being said, I ran on safety and security and accountability as my main focus. Since then we added a layered security apparatus that involves weapon detection systems, security camera upgrades, security vestibules, etc. We had the superintendent hire a director of security and an assistant superintendent to focus on safety and accountability directly in the schools.\nAlternative Education at the secondary level was something I wanted to ensure was available to the district when these students displayed undesirable behaviors and were, in most cases, sent home or suspended long term. Although DCPS by law still has to provide them educational services, many students never completed those tasks and were in the community being unaccountable. Making the investment in alternative education now ensures that there is a program in place in each high school for students that are experiencing difficulty in their normal setting.\nStudents that are placed on long term suspension are asked to participate in the off-campus alternative education program in Woolford and are there for an average of 44 days. This is in collaboration with the student and the parents. Many of the students are also given the opportunity to participate in the Functional Family Therapy program that is also offered as an intensive in-home wrap-around service.\nI can't think of a better example of the term \"equity\" than this. Providing structural, long-term, evidenced-based services to our most at risk populations.\nThis Board also approved a three year agreement with the educators, increasing their compensation to meet the Blueprint standards.\nThe overall goal is to provide the community the best education possible. DCPS is currently 23 out of 24 in Maryland, something the acting superintendent reminds us of frequently. We didn't get here overnight. I feel more confident that we are charging ahead with the mentality of accountability at all levels. This approach will shape the management and leadership culture in the district and will have a direct effect in the learning process.\nLastly, it's been a difficult year for this board, losing two of it's members in less than a year. I would like to take the opportunity to remember the late Board President Mrs. Laura Layton and Board member Dr. Theresa Stafford. Both of these women were invaluable assets to the district and the communities they served. We will miss them.\nLUCAS THORPE\nLucas Thorpe is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhy are you running?\nIn response to a recent inquiry about my motivation for running, I delved into the decisions made by the current Board of Education. My concern stems from a belief that, at times, our representatives may not prioritize the best interests of students. To illustrate this, I scrutinized recent board decisions, and one instance that stood out was the vote on the Mid Shore Community Mediation Center contract on Sept. 21, 2023, resulting in a narrow 3-2 defeat.\nThe focal point of this concern lies in the decision-making process surrounding the Mid Shore Community Mediation Center contract, an annual renewal that faced a tight vote on Sept. 21, 2023, resulting in a narrow 3-2 defeat. The contract, valued at $56,000, is contingent upon Title IV grant funding. This funding source underscores the significance of the contract, as its forfeiture could potentially impact the availability of funds allocated for critical student-oriented initiatives. However, the dynamics of the decision-making process raised eyebrows, particularly due to a remark made by the now current Board President during deliberations, to quote, \"Mr. Diaz doesn't understand why Mid Shore Community Mediation Center goes to SDS when they do not have any conflict issues\".\nThe comment, expressing a lack of understanding about why Mid Shore Community Mediation Center engages with schools that purportedly do not have conflict issues, is not merely a casual observation. At its core, it reveals a potential blind spot in comprehending the nuanced dynamics of student and school interactions. Schools, despite appearing conflict-free on the surface, often grapple with intricate challenges that may not be immediately apparent.\nMid Shore Community Mediation Center or MSCMC, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, operates with the mission of \"building stronger, safer communities through education and collaborative processes that prevent and respond to conflict and increase access to justice.\" The organization initiated a pilot program at Maces Lane Middle School in 2011 and expanded to include Cambridge-South Dorchester High School, North Dorchester Middle School, and North Dorchester High School in 2013. MSCMC offers a range of mediation services, including staff/staff, staff/student, student/student, attendance mediation, community conferencing, conflict management workshops, restorative practices, and more.\nSince piloting at MLMS in 2011, MSCMC has received over 3,200 requests for service, conducted 1,300+ mediation sessions, and maintained an overall average agreement rate of 90%. Data from a school-based mediation evaluation survey conducted by MSCMC revealed that 89% of students believed mediation could have prevented their conflict from resulting in a fight. Additionally, 100% of adults agreed that mediation was a positive way to address concerns they had about a student.\nMid Shore Mediation's proposal for third-party intervention is not without merit. The organization has the potential to offer valuable assistance in various situations without compromising student success. This is a sentiment echoed by numerous school principals who emphasize the crucial role of Mid Shore Mediation's support. It's crucial to recognize that the contracted $56,000 is derived from Title IV grant funds specifically earmarked for this purpose. Therefore, if not utilized, these funds would be forfeited. This underscores the importance of a nuanced understanding of the funding structure and the potential impact on student-oriented initiatives.\nThis case exemplifies a concerning trend where the Board may inadvertently operate under personal agendas, or a presumption of superior knowledge compared to the seasoned leadership within our schools. These leaders are entrusted with the crucial task of operations and management, navigating the day-to-day challenges that shape the educational experience for our students.\nAs we reflect on decisions like these, it's essential to foster an environment where the expertise and insights of educators, administrators, and school leaders are considered integral to the decision-making process. The goal is to ensure that each choice aligns with the overarching mission of fostering an environment conducive to student success and well-being. In scrutinizing such decisions, we pave the way for a more inclusive and collaborative approach that genuinely prioritizes the best interests of our students and our community.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a candidate for the Board of Education, I bring a unique blend of experience, passion, and dedication to student success. Having previously served as a student member on the board, I understand the inner workings of the education system and the challenges that students face firsthand. This experience has equipped me with valuable insights into the needs and aspirations of our student population.\nIn addition to my board experience, my current work in the nonprofit sector serving Dorchester County Public Schools students has further deepened my understanding of the issues affecting our educational system. Through my role, I have developed innovative programs and initiatives aimed at supporting student growth and achievement.\nI am committed to fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and excellence within the board. My goal is to ensure that every decision made reflects a student-first mindset and contributes to the overall improvement of our educational system.\nFurthermore, I am dedicated to promoting innovation and equity in education. I will work tirelessly to advocate for resources and programs that empower all students to reach their full potential, regardless of their background or circumstances.\nOverall, I bring a wealth of experience, a steadfast dedication to student success and a strong commitment to collaborative leadership to the Board of Education.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most pressing issue facing Dorchester County Public Schools right now is the need for transparent leadership and enhanced engagement and collaboration within the community. Transparent leadership is essential to building trust and accountability within the school system. It involves open communication, honesty and a willingness to involve stakeholders in the decision making process. Without transparency, there is a risk of misinformation, confusion and a lack of confidence in the board's actions. Furthermore, engagement and collaboration are crucial for fostering a sense of community ownership and collective responsibility for student success. This includes actively seeking input from parents, students, teachers, and community members, and incorporating their feedback into decision-making processes.\nTo address this issue, the board needs to prioritize transparent leadership and engagement by:\nEstablishing clear channels of communication: The board should ensure that information regarding policies, decisions, and initiatives is readily accessible to all stakeholders through multiple communication channels, including online platforms, community meetings and newsletters.Soliciting feedback: The board should actively seek input from stakeholders on important issues facing the school system. This can be done through surveys, town hall meetings and advisory committees to ensure that diverse perspectives are considered in decision making.Collaborating with community partners: The board should foster partnerships with local organizations, businesses and community leaders to leverage resources and expertise in addressing challenges facing DCPS. By working together, we can develop innovative solutions and support initiatives that benefit all students.Prioritizing school safety: Ensuring the safety and well-being of students and staff is paramount. The board should implement evidence-based safety measures, such as mental health support services, crisis intervention training and threat assessment protocols, to create a secure learning environment for all.\nIn summary, transparent leadership and engagement are fundamental to addressing the most important issues facing DCPS. By prioritizing these principles and working collaboratively with stakeholders, the board can build trust, foster a sense of community ownership, and ultimately, improve outcomes for all students.\nWhat goals do the board And district need to be working toward?\nThe goals that the board and district need to be working toward are multifaceted and require a comprehensive approach to address the challenges facing Dorchester County Public Schools. First and foremost, we need to prioritize improving academic outcomes and student achievement. Currently, DCPS is ranked 23 out of 24 systems in the state of Maryland, which is unacceptable. We must work tirelessly to elevate our educational standards and ensure that every student receives a high-quality education that prepares them for success.\nTo achieve this goal, we need to focus on several key areas:\nLeadership and support: It's imperative that we put strong leaders in leadership positions within the district and empower them to lead effectively. This means providing them with the resources, training and support they need to succeed without micromanaging them. By fostering a culture of trust and collaboration, we can create an environment where innovation and excellence thrive.Parent and community involvement: We must actively engage parents and community leaders in the educational process by enlisting them to fill vital roles within the school system, including educational support personnel, mentors and volunteers. By forging strong partnerships with families and community stakeholders, we can create a supportive network that enhances student learning and success.Addressing chronic absenteeism: Chronic absenteeism is a significant issue in our county and requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders to combat. We need to mobilize parents, community leaders and school staff to ensure that every child attends school regularly and on time. This may involve implementing targeted interventions, providing support services to at-risk students and raising awareness about the importance of attendance.Discipline and behavioral remediation: Discipline issues are pervasive in our district, and we must take proactive steps to address them. This includes supporting our teachers and administrators in maintaining a safe and orderly learning environment, enforcing consistent disciplinary practices and providing access to behavioral remediation resources and supports. Additionally, we should explore partnerships with community organizations and law enforcement to enhance school safety and support positive behavior.College and career readiness: While graduation rates in our county hover around 80%, we need to shift our focus beyond simply graduating students and ensure that they are adequately prepared for college and careers. This requires continued investment in after school programming, career and technology education and additional supports to encourage student success beyond high school. By equipping students with the skills, knowledge and opportunities they need to thrive, we can set them on a path toward lifelong success.\nThe board and district need to prioritize academic excellence, foster parent and community involvement, address chronic absenteeism and discipline issues, and promote college and career readiness. By working collaboratively toward these goals, we can create a school system that provides every student with the tools and opportunities they need to achieve their full potential.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nTo effectively address this question, it's crucial to first understand the Kirwan Commission, also known as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. As a law passed in the Maryland State Legislature, my stance on the Blueprint is clear: I fully support its objectives and initiatives.\nNow, the conversation shifts to how our school system will implement and stay on track with what is outlined in the Blueprint.\nOne key aspect of the Blueprint that I strongly endorse is Pillar 2, which focuses on high quality and diverse teachers and leaders. This pillar mandates that local school systems implement new teacher ladders, including a minimum teacher salary of $60,000 by fiscal year 2026. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of partnering with Historically Black Colleges and Universities to increase and support the pipeline of diverse teachers and leaders. Increasing teacher pay is essential for Dorchester to remain competitive and attract top talent to our schools.\nHowever, it's important to note that while I fully support the Blueprint, it is not currently fully funded by the State of Maryland. Despite a budget surplus in fiscal year 2023, the state is projected to face a structural budget deficit of $761 million by fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2024, DCPS received $58,118,000 in direct state funding and $24,006,038 in funding from the county. Historically, our county commissioners have funded education locally at around 0.0-1.0% above the Maintenance of Effort, whereas neighboring Wicomico County funds at roughly 5.0-10.0% above the MOE. As leaders in the school system and the county council, it's imperative that we collaborate to find ways to fully fund initiatives and programming efforts locally.\nOne positive outcome of the Blueprint that has already manifested is the addition of positions like career coaches, who now cover all of our secondary schools. These positions play a vital role in supporting students' college and career readiness.\nMoving forward, we should advocate for better understanding of the Blueprint and seek additional supports for rural communities like Dorchester. By working together and prioritizing education funding, we can ensure that every student in our county receives the high-quality education they deserve.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nThe increase in kindergarten readiness from 32% to 39% is certainly a positive development, indicating that some measures implemented by the district are yielding results. However, it also highlights areas where further improvement is necessary.\nFirstly, the uptick in kindergarten readiness suggests that the district may be implementing effective early childhood education initiatives or interventions targeted at improving school readiness among young learners. These could include programs focused on pre-literacy skills, numeracy, social-emotional development and overall school readiness.\nHowever, the fact that kindergarten readiness remains below 50% indicates that there is still significant room for improvement. This underscores the need for continued investment in early childhood education programs and resources, as well as a comprehensive approach to addressing the factors that may contribute to lower readiness rates.\nTo build on this progress and further increase kindergarten readiness, the district may need to consider several strategies. This includes expanding access to high-quality pre-K, Judy Center and pre-k 3 programs, increasing parent and community engagement in early childhood education, providing professional development opportunities for early childhood educators and implementing evidence-based practices proven to enhance school readiness. Additionally, it's essential for the district to closely monitor and assess the effectiveness of its initiatives through data-driven decision making. By identifying areas of strength and areas for improvement, the district can refine its approaches and allocate resources more effectively to support the success of all students, starting from their earliest years of schooling.\nThis upward trend in kindergarten readiness is a testament to the dedicated efforts of our early childhood department within the central office. Their visionary leadership has charted a new course for the direction of early childhood education in Dorchester County, and I commend their commitment to ensuring that every child enters kindergarten ready to learn. With continued investment and support from the Board of Education, I am confident that our KRA data will continue to show significant improvements, setting our students on a path to long-term success. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We needed a new road to bring a loop around before we could start on the construction,\" Evans said. \"We would like to thank Stacey Seward and Dan Fox, who is not here, from Caroline County to help us get a community development block grant that helped us build this road. Justin Fair was the project manager at the state and Cindy Stone. And then Robyne Chaconas, who is the deputy director the Community Development Administration.\"\nThe excited crowd clapped.\n\"When we talk about this master plan, it didn't only take a village in the beginning to develop the plan. It is going to take a village to bring it to fruition. We are starting to see that by this first step,\" Evans said.\nThen on this windy cloudless day, 10 people joined Evans as he snipped the royal blue ribbon signifying the opening of the road around campus.\nGoing 100 feet and down a hill were five golden shovels by a patch of dirt. In the background was a backhoe and the space where residences will be built.\nBenedictine got $1.8 million in congressional directed funding to support these new spaces for residents who have developmental and intellectual disabilities and autism.\n\"Benedictine is launching its 'Transforming Lives' campaign to address the needs of its student demographic that has significantly changed since the existing residential spaces were built,\" a press release from Benedictine said. \"Over 80% of the student population that Benedictine now supports is living with more complicated forms of autism. The new residential wings will include suites equipped with multiple recreational and sensory areas, along with an updated dining area and state-of-the-art infirmary.\"\nEvans spoke while those assembled grabbed golden shovels.\n\"Where we stand now and what is behind me is the old convent for the sisters. As you know, our campus operates 24/7, 365. When we started this, one of the biggest obstacles was how are we going to update our facilities and not hamper what we do on a daily basis serving the students,\" Evans said.\n\"We could refine and develop a space that really does meet the needs of the student profile that we serve today. That is what is most important. The next is how do we pay for it?\"\nFunding for the school comes primarily from the state, Evans said.\n\"A lot of people stepped up beginning with Gov. Hogan's office and then Gov. Moore's office giving us capital. And then our entire congressional delegation, including Sens. Van Hollen and Cardin, Rep. Andy Harris,\" he said.\nThere was even more local delegation support that included state legislators \u2014 Sen. Stephen Hershey and Sen. Johnny Mautz, Del. Jeff Ghrist, Del. Chris Adams, Del. Steven Arentz and Del. Jay Jacobs, Evans said.\n\"They really went to bat for us with bond bill money and capital monies at the state. Because of our advocates in Annapolis, we were able to get $1.25 million in capital, which is huge,\" he said.\nBenedictine will start building the new facility in a few weeks. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Candidates to face off for Talbot Board of Education positions\n\n May 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 3042\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Talbot County's Board of Education has three position on the ballot this year for Districts 2, 5 and 6. There are currently six candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Talbot Public Schools.Candidates in District 2 will appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election. The Districts 5 and 6 candidates will not be on the ballot until November, since no more than two candidates are registered in those races.\nEach position will serve a four-year term beginning in Dec. 1, 2024, and ending in Dec.1, 2028.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the eight candidates competing for the seats to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity and length. Extended versions of the candidates' Q&As can be found at stardem.com.\nCANDACE HENRY\nCandace Henry is running for the District 2 Board of Education seat. She is currently on the Board of Education.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nSeveral very important issues face Talbot County Public Schools. One key issue is the recruitment and retention of diverse teachers and administrators.\nAs a board, we should continue and enhance our efforts to create a welcoming and supportive work environment, offer competitive compensation, increase opportunities for high-quality professional development, prioritize work-life balance, and recognize the value of all educators.\nAnother important issue is the opportunity gap. To address the opportunity gap, it is important to continue our multi-faceted approach to advancing equity throughout TCPS. Examples include resource allocation, targeted support for underserved communities, access to challenging courses for all students, data-informed decision-making, community engagement, and recruiting diverse educators.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe implementation of the Blueprint involves careful planning, collaboration with stakeholders, and a focus on equity. Additionally, TCPS leadership should continue efforts to regularly communicate with our local community and stakeholders on the progress and updates related to implementation planning.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nEach year, the board and district meet to identify and align our goals with the district's strategic planning initiatives. The board and district should continue to work toward several overarching goals to effectively improve educational experiences and outcomes for all students.\nWe should continue to ensure that all students have equitable access to high-quality education, regardless of their background, socioeconomic status, race, or ability. This includes addressing disparities in resources, opportunities, and outcomes among student populations.\nThe board and district should continue to set ambitious goals that focus on improving student achievement, closing achievement gaps, increasing proficiency levels in core subjects, and preparing students for post-secondary education and/or career success.\nWhy are you running?\nI currently serve on the TCPS School Board, a position I've been proud to hold for the last 4 years. I am inspired by my personal experiences as a student in Talbot County Public Schools and am a proud alumna of Easton High School.\nI am also a mother of two TCPS students. My grandmother's legacy as a TCPS educator has instilled in me a profound passion for education, which has fueled my dedication to serving on the Board of Education.\nI witnessed my grandmother go above and beyond for her students and work tirelessly in our community to help others. Her work inspired and shaped the mother, advocate, wife, community leader, and professional that I am today.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nI bring over 20 years of advocacy experience and a deep commitment to public education to the Board of Education.\nRegarding my professional background, I am currently the director of the Disability Resource Center at Salisbury University, where I am responsible for the oversight and coordination of all operational, administrative, budgetary, personnel, outreach, and assessment activities for students with disabilities.\nAdditionally, I am an adjunct professor in the College of Health and Human Services, where I co-developed and teach in the university's first disability studies minor.\nData is showing a lack of kindergarten preparedness since the pandemic. What do you feel needs to be done to help young students catch up to pre-pandemic numbers?\nTCPS's commitment to engaging families as partners in their children's education has been critical to the goal of improving kindergarten preparedness. I am in support of expanding access to high-quality early childhood education programs, including pre-kindergarten and Head Start programs, especially for children from historically-excluded backgrounds.\nThese programs can provide a strong foundation for academic and social-emotional development before kindergarten. Additionally, extended learning opportunities, such as summer and afterschool programs, can also provide complimentary academic support and enrichment experiences for young students.\nWe should also continue to establish systems for ongoing data monitoring and assessment to track students' progress in kindergarten preparedness and adjust strategies as needed. Using data to identify areas of improvement and allocate resources strategically to support student success.\nOver the past decade, Talbot County elementary schools have seen a rise in Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language. What would you suggest or hope to do to better accommodate these students?\nI support TCPS's continued efforts to increase and strengthen support for our Hispanic and ELL students.\nTo better accommodate Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language in Talbot County elementary schools, it's essential to implement strategies that foster a supportive and inclusive learning environment while addressing student needs.\nSuch strategies include establishing strong partnerships with Hispanic families and community organizations, increasing outreach initiatives, incorporating culturally responsive teaching practices, and expanding support services to include topics related to academic support, cultural integration, and navigating the school system.\nCYNTHIA JURRIUS\nCynthia Jurrius is running for the District 6 Board of Education seat.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most significant issues facing Talbot County Public Schools are interrelated:\nStudent mastery of essential knowledge and skills.Retention, recruitment, and support of excellent teachers.Positive, safe, effective, inclusive school climate for all learners.Family and student engagement.\nAlthough test scores are not always indicative of a student's mastery of the subject matter, statewide and local assessments indicate that many of our TCPS students are not yet achieving grade level standards in essential subjects.\nOne of the most significant indicators for student success is an effective teacher, and, like the rest of the nation, Talbot faces significant teacher shortages.\nA positive, safe, effective, and inclusive school climate is fundamental for student success, as well as teacher retention. Finding innovative ways to engage families, including non English speakers, and students will support all aspects of student success.\nThe current board and superintendent are making progress toward addressing these issues despite many challenges, such as the learning gap caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through additional instructional support, expanding use of innovative community partnerships, strategic use of technology, targeted allocation of resources, and engaging all sectors of our community, I believe that working together we can accelerate progress in these areas.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling the Blueprint?\nThe board, Superintendent (Sharon) Pepukayi and team have a detailed plan for managing the Blueprint. I commend the transparency with which they are approaching this massive undertaking, providing regular reports on Blueprint progress for public review.\nThere are areas of the Blueprint that Talbot was already doing well and new areas that are now required to be addressed. There are many aspects of the Blueprint that are positive. However, the most challenging aspects of the Blueprint in Talbot are state mandates without sufficient funding.\nI would support continued efforts to address the state funding formula as it has been applied to Talbot County.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nAs stated in the TCPS FY 23 Annual Report, the board and superintendent have identified the following goals:\n\"Academic Equity and Achievement; increasing student mastery of grade level/course mathematics standards as measured by local assessments and MCAP measures.\nFostering an Engaging Environment; create and maintain a supportive environment that engages all students and staff.\nHiring and Retaining Highly Qualified and Diverse Staff. Recruit, hire, retain, and promote highly qualified and diverse staff.\"\nI support these goals \u2014 innovative, collaborative solutions are needed to accomplish the goals.\nWhy are you running?\nOur public schools play a pivotal role in shaping our community's future, and we need community members on our board who can help move Talbot County Public Schools forward to excellence.\nI serve to make a difference, I care about kids, and I have skills and experience to contribute. I would listen to all perspectives and value the richness in diversity of opinion.\nI am a natural collaborator, skilled at helping people work together to find solutions to challenging community problems. I am also willing to speak up and ask tough questions when necessary.\nI want to ensure that our Talbot Board of Education continues to function effectively and that the polarization that has infected many school districts stays out of our community. We have many strengths on which to build, and together we can solve any challenge.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a seasoned community leader and mediator, I am committed to fostering an inclusive environment where all perspectives are heard, valued, and considered.\nThrough my community involvement; career as an attorney, community mediator, former director of a local nonprofit; and in my current role, I have honed the skills necessary to navigate complex community challenges.\nAs director of youth and family services for Mid Shore Community Mediation, and later as executive director, I launched the implementation of school-based programs focused on conflict resolution, leveraging limited resources for successful outcomes for students.\nI thrive on the challenge of collaborating with diverse stakeholders to uncover innovative solutions that benefit all parties involved. As the parent of three TCPS graduates, I understand the importance of advocating for policies and initiatives that prioritize the well-being and academic success of every student.\nAs a family member of educators and school administrators, I bring a multifaceted understanding of the educational landscape. We have many good things to celebrate in the Talbot County Public Schools \u2014 a great foundation of caring and skilled teachers, experienced administrators, an effective Board, and fantastic kids.\nI am dedicated to listening, collaborating, and working hard to ensure that our schools continue to evolve and thrive for the benefit of our entire community.\nData is showing a lack of kindergarten preparedness since the pandemic. What do you feel needs to be done to help young students catch up to pre-pandemic numbers?\nTCPS is currently implementing aspects of the Blueprint that provide for expanded pre-K, to support improved kindergarten readiness in the future.\nAdditionally, these students are now moving through the elementary grades, and students at other grade levels also have a pandemic learning gap. The existence of the gap needs to be recognized and addressed at all grade levels.\nAt the elementary, middle school, and high school levels, additional math coaches, use of differentiated self-paced technology, and additional instructional aides could be beneficial, including bi-lingual math and language coaches.\nIt is essential to meet students where they are, so that students who need support are not left behind, and those who are ready to excel have that opportunity.\nOver the past decade, Talbot County elementary schools have seen a rise in Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language. What would you suggest or hope to do to better accommodate these students?\nProviding an inclusive environment that supports all learners is important at all grade levels, and students who are not yet proficient in English come into TCPS at all grade levels.\nIt is essential for students at all grade levels to receive support to achieve English language proficiency, as well as support in other subject areas. The types of support for young learners, who are emerging readers, may differ from those for older students.\nThere is considerable research available about working with emerging language learners at all grade levels, and as a Board member, I would look for the best evidenced-based approaches.\nIn addition to providing additional bi-lingual instructional aides in classrooms, math and language coaching, and other direct supports for ESOL students, working with community organizations and community partners to engage these students and their families could be beneficial.\nANNA HOWIE\nAnna Howie is running for the District 5 Board of Education seat. She currently serves on the Talbot County Board of Education.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now is providing exceptional education opportunities for all students while being fiscally responsible.\nCurrently, the curriculum coordinating committee has brought high quality resources to the board for approval in the areas of reading and mathematics. These resources are paid for through educational grants.\nUtilizing grants is a responsible way of ensuring that we are providing our students with high quality instructional materials while being fiscally responsible.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future is designed to improve the quality of education for all children in Maryland and is law. We must ensure that our plan is attainable to meet the goals of the five pillars.\nTalbot County Public Schools and the Board of Education worked in collaboration to create three goals to serve as the priorities for this school year.\nThe goals include ensuring that we recruit and retain a high quality and diverse staff, increase and improve our mathematics Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program (MCAP) scores, and ensure that our schools are safe. These goals directly align with the pillars of the Blueprint.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nTalbot County Public Schools and the Board of Education have been working toward three goals which are recruiting and retaining a high quality and diverse staff, increasing and improving our mathematics MCAP scores, and ensuring that our schools are safe.\nTCPS and the Board of Education are on target with the three identified goals that we are working towards that align with the needs of the school system, as identified through stakeholder surveys, as well as the Blueprint. TCPS will continue to work collaboratively with stakeholders to continuously improve and meet the needs of our community.\nWhy are you running?\nI am running for a position on the Talbot County Board of Education because not only am I a product of public-school education, I come from a long line of educators and education is my passion.\nMy grandfather was the industrial arts teacher at Moton High School and Easton High School. My mother was a teacher at Easton Middle School, as well as an elementary school teacher in Michigan and Florida.\nMy husband has worked as a special education teacher, assistant principal, principal (Easton High School), and now currently services as the director of student services in Dorchester County. My daughter is a fifth-grade elementary school teacher.\nEducation is extremely important to me and my family, and we have made it our mission to ensure that all students receive a high-quality education.\nStudents deserve to learn in a safe and nurturing environment that allows them to discover their strengths and develop skills that will ensure that they grow to be lifelong learners and productive citizens.\nAs a board member, I want to ensure that our students are safe, healthy and successful. Teachers should be compensated at a wage that respects their professional position and levels of education.\nCommunity stakeholders should be reassured that the students from our school system are provided with the best education and are college and career ready when they graduate from high school. As a member of the board, I will make it my job to do what is necessary for all of our students to succeed.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nI bring to the Talbot County board more than 20 years of public-school experience.\nMy career in education has progressed from being a teacher to an instructional mathematics coach, human resource administrator, local accountability coordinator, curriculum supervisor for mathematics and career and technical education, and a principal.\nI have learned so much from the various roles that I have had the privilege of working in over the years.

    "content": "St. Michaels library looks to expand its footprint\n\n May 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 599\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The Talbot County Free Library St. Michaels Branch is unfurling plans for its upcoming 3,700-square-foot expansion.Though they are still waiting on some county funding to come through, representatives from the library said renovations are expected to begin this fall.\nThe Talbot County Free Library has raised around $5 million to renovate the St. Michaels Branch. The 12- to 15-month build is expected to be completed by December 2025 or January 2026. The library will close while the build occurs.\nArchitects Mike Wheedleton, project manager, and Payton Bridge, senior architect, both of Davis, Bowen and Friedel, are working on the project.\nThe total cost of the project is $6.3 million, so there is an active private short-term fundraising campaign goal of $500,000 to make up some of the remaining funds needed.\nFriends of the Talbot County Library have already raised $50,000, said Dana Newman, director of the Talbot County Free Library. She said she has a very active library Board of Trustees that is engaged on the project.\n\"There is a grant at the state level called a Maryland Capital Grant Program. That can provide up to a 50% match. Over time I think we have built a case with the County Council to have this project funded. So they are actually committed to funding 50% of the project,\" Newman said.\nThere has been a lot of dreaming and practical thinking going into how to best serve residents with this expansion.\nThe process began with town-hall-like meetings where community members voiced what they wanted in their new library on 106 Fremont Street.\n\"It is not your mother's library anymore. We are not shushing people, but we are going to have study rooms like they have in Easton,\" Newman said.\nShe cited the community hub aspect of the library, saying it is really more of a community center.\n\"The community is changing. The town is changing. It seems to be definitely what they want. They want the increased technology that we will be able to have. We want to provide the things that the community wants and what they have asked for,\" said Shauna Beulah, branch manager at the St. Michaels branch.\n\"We want to have some quiet spaces and a better arranged space for teens and young people. They enjoy their technology. How we are now is we are too open and wide and they don't have a space where they can do those things,\" Beulah said.\nWhile accommodating younger library patrons, she also wants there to be quiet spaces for reading and improved facilities for the library to continue offering services to all members of the community.\nThe renovation will be recognizable from the street. The library will extend further out front, closer to the sidewalk. The fountain will go away, and there will be a 40% larger meeting room and a children's area to encourage early literacy.\nThe new library will also have an exhibit space and interactive outside spaces. It will be accessible according to the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\"We are one of the few places in the Bay Hundred area that has meeting room space that is free and available,\" Beulah said.\nWhile the library is closed, it are looking for temporary quarters to keep serving the community.\n\"The county is helping to provide some funding for a temporary location,\" Newman said.\nAdditionally there is a building campaign to provide equipment and furniture. The library just got a $100,000 private donation as part of a naming opportunity. There are other naming opportunities available.\n\"I love seeing the excitement in the community. I love seeing the possibility of what this library could mean to the community. I love the engagement,\" Newman said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The learned are perfectly prepared to live in a world that no longer exists.\"\nAt Johns Hopkins, HopStart learners will not only inherit the future. They also will make our world a better place.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This is a common practice in elections to give voters insight into how to cast their ballot.\nThe Associated Press, in a July 2023 story, described Moms For Liberty as a \"parental rights\" group that has sought to take over school boards in multiple states.\nThe group has been accused of harassing community members, advancing anti-LGBTQ+ misinformation and fighting to scrub diverse and inclusive material from lesson plans, according to the AP story.\nMoms for Liberty advocates for various conservative causes in education, such as opposing critical race theory and advocating for school choice. They often mobilize parents to attend school board meetings, petition policymakers, and advocate for changes in curriculum and policies.\nWhether Moms for Liberty poses a threat is a matter of perspective.\nSupporters argue that they are exercising their democratic rights to advocate for their beliefs and values, particularly in education, where they feel their voices have been marginalized.\nCritics raise concerns about the group's impact on public education, the potential for polarization within communities, and whether their advocacy could lead to the undermining of public institutions and democratic processes.\n\"'Parental rights' is an appealing term, but voters have caught on to the reality that it is fueling book bans, anti-LGBT efforts, pressure on teachers not to discuss race and gender, whitewashing history, and so on,\" said political analyst Larry Sabato, a politics professor at the University of Virginia and founder and director of the Center for Politics, who was quoted in a November Washington Post article. \"Parents may want more input in the schools, but as a group they certainly aren't as extreme as many in the Moms for Liberty.\"\nHere in Talbot County, I wish the local candidates had taken the time to write about their stances on issues. There is no doubt that there will be voters in Talbot County who agree with them. In some districts, that may be a majority. Yet few people know what these candidates stand for.\nThe fortunate thing: Due to only two candidates running in each district, all of these candidates will be on the ballot again in November. Only District 2 will be on the May 14 primary ballot. In that district, three candidates will be listed, but Connie Loveland said that she has withdrawn from the race, albeit too late to have her name removed from the ballot.\nThe November election will give these candidates another opportunity to tell voters what they stand for. I hope they take it. Before voters cast their ballots, they deserve to know where candidates stand.\nTalbot County this week celebrated the businesses that keep our region's economy thriving. It was an inspirational event.\n\"Our goal is to connect the business community with resources that will help them succeed and grow, and to tell the stories of business leaders who are doing extraordinary things,\" said Cassandra Vanhooser, director of Talbot County's Department of Economic Development and Tourism.\nBefore the awards, Chris Pilkerton, former acting administrator and general legal counsel for the U.S. Small Business Administration, talked about the value of small businesses in the county. He should know. His wife, Amanda Cook, owns the Tilghman Island Baking Company in Tilghman where the couple live.\n\"Talbot County's small business community actively seeks out ways to work together to support each other and their businesses,\" Pilkerton said. \"That type of environment creates real opportunities for new and existing companies.\"\nHe praised the county's economic development efforts.\n\"I have had the opportunity to travel through many states and counties throughout the country and meet directly with local economic development officials,\" he said. \"In my experience, the team within Talbot County is uniquely supportive of their small businesses and is accessible to help with so many topics as they come up.\"\nPilkerton is right. The team led by Cassandra Vanhooser continues to provide much needed support for businesses both small and large in Talbot County. We are lucky to have such talent here.\nA Washington Post story this week showed alarming data for the Eastern Shore, sea levels are rising quickly along the Gulf coast and Atlantic seaboard. The story documented the change in coastal sea levels between 2010 and 2023, in some cases more than 8 inches in the past 14 years.\n\"Since 2010, it's very abnormal and unprecedented,\" said Jianjun Yin, a climate scientist at the University of Arizona who has studied the changes. While it is possible the swift rate of sea level rise could eventually taper, the higher water that has already arrived in recent years is here to stay.\n\"It's irreversible,\" he said in the story.\nThe study included Cambridge, which has seen a 2.8-inch sea level rise since 2010. That was the only Eastern Shore community listed in the story.\nThis increase should not be a surprise to people in the area. A friend with a home on the Choptank River in Cambridge has pumped out his basement multiple times this year, not due to heavy rains but because of high tides.\nJust over a week ago, Oxford announced a pair of federal grants to address the rising sea levels. One grant of $2.6 million is to raise 14 Oxford homes. Residents in those homes agreed to covering 10% of the cost for their home to be elevated. The other 90% of the cost will be paid by the federal government. Lewis said one of those 14 homes is currently being elevated.\nCommission President Tom Costigan turned to the residents in the room, \"I hope you all appreciate just how gigantic this is.\"\nMany towns on the Eastern Shore are taking steps to deal with this problem. As shown by the sea level increases reported in this week's Washington Post story, there is no time to waste.\nJim Johnson is the Star Democrat executive editor.

    "content": "Maryland\u2019s education \u2018Blueprint\u2019 struggles to expand pre-K\n\n May 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIJKE FRIEDMAN and NATALIE WEGER Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1586\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As a group of 4-year-old boys worked to create a towering building block castle in their colorful Montgomery County Public Schools pre-K classroom, Head Start teacher Molly Scherf reminded them it is important to build a strong foundation.The boys used their tiny hands to create the tower piece by piece, building the foundation to their castle \u2014 and also for their future education.With research showing children who attend pre-K perform better in later years, the Blueprint for Maryland's Future \u2014 the state's landmark education plan \u2014 aims to make pre-K much more widely available to every 3- and 4-year-old in the state.\nMolly Scherf, who has worked in early childhood education for 30 years, said it's a great idea.\n\"[Pre-K] is not just all about learning the letters of the alphabet or learning how to count to 10, it's also learning how to get along with your peers,\" she said.\nThe state's plan to make pre-K free to low- and moderate-income families and available to all faces some serious struggles, however. The Blueprint relies on a mix of private providers and public schools to expand the availability of pre-K \u2014 but many districts are struggling to enlist enough private providers. On top of that, some public schools that would otherwise host the pre-K population don't have the room to do so.\nEducators in the state call the Blueprint pre-K plan a \"mixed delivery system\" that aims to expand pre-K without making it a public school monopoly.\n\"So in theory, it's a great model,\" said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Accountability and Implementation Board, the state agency created to oversee the Blueprint. \"In practice, it has a lot of challenges.\"\nThe state says 30,718 children were enrolled in pre-K in Maryland during the 2022-23 school year, and that number is expected to expand as the 10-year Blueprint is implemented.\nThe Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education, which drew up the early childhood education effort incorporated into the Blueprint, estimated the changes it proposed would mean 80% of eligible children would be in pre-K when the plan is fully implemented. That's a lofty goal considering state figures showed the pre-K participation rate for 4-year-olds was below 50% in half of Maryland's school districts in 2022-23.\nCosts will increase along with the pre-K population. According to the state's Department of Legislative Services, Blueprint-related early childhood programs cost the state $445 million in fiscal year 2023 alone. While future cost increases depend largely on enrollment, that department projects a 15.7% increase in funding for pre-K programs between fiscal years 2024 and 2025.\nResearch shows that could be a good investment. William T. Gormley, co-director of Georgetown University's Center for Research on Children in the United States, and his colleagues tracked the results of youngsters in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for more than 20 years after they left pre-K. The researchers found that while 44% of children who attended pre-K went on to college, only a third of those who missed out on pre-K went on to higher education.\n\"In this respect, early childhood education is indeed the gift that keeps on giving,\" Gormley and his colleagues wrote in a 2023 paper.\nThat being the case, Pillar 1 of the Blueprint \u2014 early childhood education \u2014 calls for government-funded pre-K to be available to all low-income 4-year-olds by the 2025-26 fiscal year. Preschool will be free to all 3- and 4-year-olds from families that earn up to 300% of the federal poverty level. Families with incomes between 300% and 600% of the federal poverty level will pay for pre-K on a sliding scale, and higher-income families will pay for it in full.\nInstead of placing all pre-K students in conventional public school classrooms, the plan relies on participation from both public and private child care providers. Preschool classrooms can either be in public schools or other child care facilities.\nThis will create a diverse set of pre-K options that aims to make child care accessible for limited-income families, according to Molly McGriff, senior director of United for Childcare, an initiative of the United Way of Central Maryland that aims to make child care accessible for limited-income families.\n\"That diversity benefits families as they're able to choose from all different settings that maybe look a little bit different, might be closer to home, might be able to meet their needs better,\" she said.\nThe system's struggles\nSo far, though, the mixed delivery plan is not meeting expectations.School districts were expected to have 30% of their pre-K slots filled by private providers in the 2022-23 school year, but most school systems did not meet that requirement, according to Brianna January, an associate policy director for the Maryland Association of Counties.\nAnd all but one local school district \u2014 Montgomery County Public Schools \u2014 requested a waiver after being unable to meet the requirement of having 35% of pre-K seats in the private sector for the 2023-24 school year, said Hise, of the Accountability and Implementation Board.\nWith districts expected to fill half their pre-K slots through private providers by the 2026-27 school year, districts find themselves under increasing pressure to strike deals with companies that provide that service.\n\"It's proving to be a bit more challenging than I think a lot of folks really expected,\" January said.\nThe creators of the Blueprint expected private child care providers would be interested in joining the pre-K industry, January explained, but providers are not as eager as had been anticipated.\nFor one thing, there's a money issue.\n\"We recognize that the reimbursement rate for [private] providers is not high enough to incentivize them to provide slots for these 3-year-olds,\" said Del. Courtney Watson (D-Howard). \"That is a major problem across the state.\"\nIn addition, child care providers must overcome a number of barriers before they can actually qualify to offer pre-K.\nFor example, starting in the 2025-26 school year, pre-K teaching assistants will be required to obtain either an associate's degree or a Child Development Associate certificate. Pre-K teachers will be required to have a bachelor's degree and hold teaching certification in early childhood education or be enrolled in a certification program.\nThe trouble is some child care providers will not be able to go to school and keep their businesses running at the same time, said Christina Peusch, executive director of the Maryland State Childcare Association.\n\"That is set up to fail,\" Peusch said. \"It's not equitable.\"\nAnother potential barrier is private providers must adhere to Maryland EXCELS \u2014 the state's quality rating and improvement system for child care facilities. Bonuses ranging from $150 to $13,500 will be awarded to participating child care programs on a rating scale of 1 to 5 based on program type, quality rating and capacity.\nSt. Mary's County has no private providers that are rated \"EXCELS 5,\" the highest possible ranking, said Kristen Paul, director of early childhood programs at The Parents' Place of Maryland, which connects parents of children with disabilities and health care needs to resources.\n\"We don't have enough pre-K slots right now,\" Paul said. \"We've got a gap.\"\nA space shortage?On top of the struggles in finding private providers, some education experts are concerned there is not enough physical space in some school buildings to accommodate pre-K classrooms.\n\"I would love to have pre-K in our school,\" said Jamie Miller, principal of Broadneck Elementary School in Anne Arundel County. \"But our school building is very, very old and there's not a place for them. \u2026 Every single classroom is full and at max capacity, so I don't have a space right now.\"\nShamoyia Gardiner, executive director of Strong Schools Maryland, an organization created to advocate for the passage of the Blueprint, said she's worried about such space shortages.\nFor Maryland public schools to offer pre-K, the physical space in buildings must meet standards set by the state's Interagency Commission on School Construction. But Gardiner noted the commission's requirements were not aligned with the Blueprint during its creation.\nThat commission \u2014 which decides exactly which school construction projects the state will fund \u2014 uses a \"blunt tool\" of measuring the amount of square feet per student, said Lynne Harris, a member of the Montgomery County Board of Education. But that blunt instrument doesn't take into account that pre-K classrooms have different requirements, such as a bathroom, Harris said.\n\"Are they going to finally acknowledge that to build facilities to house the pre-K programming that is mandated by the Blueprint, it's going to require the [school construction commission] to relax?\" she said.\nSome private providers need more space, too, and the state has a grant program that aims to allow them to expand.\n\"The grant is highly competitive,\" said Ruby Daniels, president of the Maryland State Family Child Care Association. \"When you apply, you're actually competing with the [local education agencies], which is the public school. You're completely competing with Head Start, you're completely competing with child care centers.\"\nIn a letter sent to state leaders in November, the Maryland Association of Counties urged lawmakers to increase state aid to construct pre-K facilities and ease requirements to encourage more private providers to take part in the program.\nThis legislative session, the General Assembly is hoping to iron out some of the Blueprint's wrinkles to ensure Maryland is living up to its promises of expanding and improving early childhood education, said Watson, the Democratic state delegate from Howard County.\nJanuary emphasized the county leaders she works with are dedicated to implementing the Blueprint and collaborating with state leaders to help expand pre-K successfully.\n\"We have to work together. We have to get it right,\" January said. \"County governments are really trying to be good partners and they want to make the Blueprint work. They want to see it successful.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Elkton teacher has green thumb for growing students' knowledge\n\n May 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 1138\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ELKTON \u2014 Most people make the same wrong assumption about Brittany Rigdon.\"No, I did not grow up on a farm,\" Rigdon said with a chuckle, before noting, \"But a lot of people think that I did.\"\nThe mistake is understandable, though, given that Rigdon has been a high school agriculture/horticulture teacher for the past 16 years \u2014 the last seven of which in the Cecil County Public Schools system \u2014 and that her classroom is a greenhouse.\nBut the reason for the common misconception goes well beyond the basic fact that Rigdon teaches horticulture at the Cecil County School of Technology. For anyone who has interacted with her, the confusion has a lot to do with Rigdon's vast knowledge of horticulture and all subjects related to it.\nPerhaps the biggest reason people mistakenly believe that she has worked on a family farm since childhood, however, is this: Ridgon exudes a green-thumb passion for horticulture and for effectively teaching the subject to her students.\nAnd those are some of the reasons why Rigdon is the 2024 Cecil County Teacher of the Year, a distinction that CCPS officials announced last month during a gala at The Wellwood restaurant in Charlestown.\n'ON OUR LEVEL'\"She does way more than just being a teacher,\" said 18-year-old Colin Schmoker, a Rising Sun High School senior who is one of Ridgon's 18 students in the two-year horticulture program. \"Because of our plant sales, the goals that she sets for herself and for us helps us, as individuals, set our own goals for school, for work and for life in general.\"\nSchmoker was referring to how Rigdon uses a practical-application approach inside her main classroom \u2014 a 90'-by-30' greenhouse where, under her guidance, students grow 1,200 poinsettias during the fall semester and then thousands of colorful flowers during the spring semester.\nWith all of the proceeds redirected into the school's horticulture program, Ridgon and her students sell the poinsettias at Christmastime and then, during this time of the year, they sell spring flowers, including ones that have been arranged into prom corsages.\nRigdon's students will be selling class-grown flowers to the public between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Saturday (May 4) during the annual Cecil County School of Technology Spring Showcase on the CCST campus at 912 Appleton Rd., northeast of Elkton.\nDuring the process of preparing for the sales of poinsettias and spring flowers, Ridgon teaches her students about the business side, including pricing to turn a profit.\nRigdon provides her students with much more than backyard-garden skills and techniques for growing plants because this is, after all, a high school horticultural science class taught by a woman who presumably grew up on a farm.\nHer students know how to take soil and texture samples, with the knowledge of which readings are desirable and undesirable and \u2014 just as importantly \u2014 why. They know how to operate tractors and other landscaping machines.\nRigdon's students also know which pesticides to use, when to use them and how to apply them. Along those lines, all of the seniors in Rigdon's class recently passed a Maryland Department of Agriculture pesticide application class and, as a result, they are legally permitted to spray higher-dose pesticides that are unavailable to the general public. The pesticide-applications certification enables her students to earn a higher wage on landscaping jobs than the pay for uncertified employees.\nIn addition, her students know how to identify scores of plants. One of her students recently passed an academically rigorous exam given by the Maryland Nursery Landscape Greenhouse Association (MNLGA) in which, as part of it, test takers must identify 240 types of plants.\nThree of her students fell short by a half point and will retake the exam next week. The MNLGA test has a 33 percent pass rate and, for those who do make the grade, they are certified professional horticulturalists, which can lead to good-paying jobs and also waivers from certain college classes. Under the MNLGA umbrella are numerous prestiges gardens in the area, including Longwood Gardens.\nThere is much to learn in the CCST horticulture program and, according to her students, Rigdon is quite natural at imparting her wealth of knowledge to them.\n\"She likes to get on our level. She has a way of making us understand,\" said Belle Granger, 17, a Rising Sun High School senior.\nJoel George, an 18-year-old North East High School senior, echoed Belle.\n\"She has a great knowledge about her subject and makes it understandable for every student,\" George said, adding that Rigdon is known to work right alongside her students. \"She doesn't just show up. She helps us.\"\nIt's noteworthy that Schmoker complimented Rigdon's character, too, as did other students. \"She is a kind person,\" Schmoker said. \"She is very well-respected and she treats everyone with respect.\"\n'KIDS LIKE MYSELF'A Wilmington, Del. native who grew up in a suburban neighborhood, Rigdon took classes in the agriculture program at Thomas McKean High School in Hockessin, Del. because she considered pursuing a career as a veterinarian.\nWhile serving as a student aide for her agriculture teacher during her senior year, however, Ridgon made a realization that put her own a different career path.\n\"A lightbulb turned on. I decided that I wanted to teach kids \u2014 like myself \u2014 that you don't have to grow up on a farm to have a career in agriculture,\" Rigdon said.\nSo, after graduating from Thomas McKean High School in 2004, Rigdon selected her courses accordingly while attending Delaware Valley University in Doylestown, Pa. And in 2008, she graduated from that college with a B.S. Degree in secondary education and agriculture.\nAfter her college graduation and before starting her teaching career, Rigdon served a summer internship at Winerthur Museum, Garden and Library in Delaware. \"I lived on the property and I learned to love plants,\" Rigdon remarked.\nStudents in Rigdon's two-year horticulture program gain the knowledge and experience to work in landscaping, at greenhouses, in florists shops and on farms. Related jobs also can be found in the government sector. In addition, they can go to college and pursue advanced degrees in horticulture.\nIn her Teacher of the Year essay, Rigdon cited a famous quote and then put her own spin on it, taking the liberty to creatively express her belief that each student needs the attention and care of a teacher to flourish.\n\"I wrote, 'To plant a seed is to believe in the future',\" Rigdon said. \"Then I wrote that you have to have more than a belief system to grow a garden. You have to tend to the crops \u2014 and every student has his or her own needs.\"\nAlthough she didn't grow up on one, it's noteworthy that Ridgon now lives on a 20-acre farm in Conowingo with her husband, George Rigdon, and that she tends to flower beds there and other chores that come with the bucolic territory.\n\"I married a farm guy,\" Rigdon laughed. \"We have tractors, chickens, hay, pumpkins, raspberries . . .\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Will plan for better pay ease teacher shortage?\n\n May 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AIDAN HUGHES and DARANEE BALACHANDAR Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 911\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fifth-grade teacher Melissa Carpenter works a 10-hour day on average during the week, and her job sometimes requires her to put in hours on weekends, too.\"I feel like teaching is one of those jobs where we go to work to do more work \u2014 to do work after work,\" said Carpenter, who teaches at William B. Wade Elementary School in Waldorf in Charles County.\nCarpenter's long hours are far from unique among Maryland's educators, as the state and nation grapple with a teacher shortage.\nThe U.S. Department of Education keeps a Teacher Shortage Areas database \u2014 and it found that for the current school year, Maryland was short of teachers in 28 subjects, which the state defines as \"areas of certification.\" That's up from 17 five years earlier. Some teacher certification areas \u2014 such as English as a second language, health science and special education \u2014 are short on teachers from pre-K through the 12th grade.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future \u2013 a landmark state law reforming public education \u2014 aims to fix that problem by \"elevating the stature of the teaching profession\" through higher pay, better training and stronger recruitment efforts.\nHowever, experts and educators have mixed views about whether that will successfully address the root causes of the shortage.\n\"Money is a huge help, but it's not everything,\" said Simon Birenbaum, director of grading, assessment and scheduling at Baltimore City Public Schools. \"Human capital is the biggest issue, and money can help with that problem, but recruiting, training and retaining high-quality teachers and staff has to be the primary focus. No amount of money can compensate for a lack of highly-skilled educators.\"\nDOCUMENTING THE SHORTAGE\nMaryland's teacher woes follow national trends. The National Center for Education Statistics reported 86% of U.S. K-12 public schools faced challenges in hiring teachers for the current school year.\nAmid the shortage, the Blueprint calls for hiring an unspecified number of additional teachers to ease the workload of classroom veterans.\n\"You hear a lot about the teacher shortage \u2014 and how are we going to implement all these Blueprint programs, which require additional staffing, when we have a teacher shortage?\" asked Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\nShortages stem, in part, from the fact that teachers are leaving the profession. In Prince George's County, 1,126 teachers resigned between July 2022 and July 2023 \u2014 up from 989 the previous year, The Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, 625 resigned in Montgomery County Public Schools, up from 576 a year earlier.\nDorchester County experienced the highest attrition rate in Maryland during the 2021-22 school year at 18%, according to a Department of Education report.\n\"I used to never have people just quit in the middle of the year,\" said Dorchester County Superintendent Dave Bromwell, who recently retired. \"The pandemic told some people, you know what? If you're not happy, move on.\"\nAll those factors end up impacting teachers like Carpenter. She said her grade level saw an influx of students, with around 30 students in her own fifth grade class this year.\n\"Our class sizes are growing, and we don't have the support in place to help some of our struggling learners,\" she said.\nBLUEPRINT PAY BUMP\nIn order to address the teacher shortage, the Blueprint provides a number of measures that lawmakers hope will encourage people to become teachers and ensure that existing ones don't leave for more lucrative out-of-state positions \u2013 or exit the profession altogether.\nA key Blueprint initiative increases teacher pay to a minimum of $60,000 by 2026. In some counties, that means a nearly $15,000 pay bump for new teachers.\nDavid Larner, chief human resource and professional development officer at the Howard County Public School System, said the pay raise will attract teachers from other states and build up Maryland's teacher workforce.\n\"If our salaries are higher than salaries in surrounding states \u2026 then candidates are more likely to come,\" Larner said.\nHowever, Hansen, of the Brookings Institution, expressed skepticism about the likely impact of the measure on the state's teacher shortage.\nHansen argued that rather than a universal rise in minimum salary levels, money should be targeted where it's needed the most \u2013 attracting teacher talent in high-need schools and specialized fields like STEM subjects and special education. He also highlighted research that suggests salary is just one of many factors that can lead to teacher attrition.\n\"I think we need to be paying teachers more \u2013 I don't think paying a $60,000 minimum wage is the way to do it,\" he said.\nWORK IN PROGRESS\nBeyond the Blueprint, the General Assembly last year passed the Maryland Educator Shortage Reduction Act, which requires the state to set recruitment goals for teacher education programs, creates an alternative teacher prep program for early childhood educators and establishes a $20,000 yearly stipend for eligible student teachers.\nGov. Wes Moore, who proposed the legislation, said upon signing it that it is intended to place \"world-class teachers in every classroom.\"\nCarpenter, the Charles County teacher, said future changes may be necessary, too.\n\"We will have new students next year, and they will [have] different needs. So we need to make sure that we are constantly evolving,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Sparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George's County, stressed that reinforcing the teacher workforce is key to the Blueprint's overall success.\n\"It lands in the hands of our educators, and if we don't have educators who are highly qualified or able to do the work, then the Blueprint work would never get accomplished,\" she said.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "School officials: Blueprint money is not enough\n\n May 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: OLIVIA BORGULA and OLIVIA YASHAROFF Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1614\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n You might think spending $16.6 billion more in state funds from 2024 through 2029 \u2014 and billions more after that \u2014 would be enough to give Maryland a world-class education system. But that's not what many people at the state's local school districts think.For proof, look at what local district leaders said in March when they updated state officials on efforts to implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's landmark effort to rebuild its public schools.\n\"The funding provided under the Blueprint is not sufficient to meet all of the requirements,\" officials in the Baltimore City Public School System wrote.\n\"Blueprint funding tied to specific programs for expansion requires the elimination of other programs and supports,\" the St. Mary's County Public School System's report said.\nMeanwhile, in Kent County, school officials bemoaned that the district will see increased costs related to staffing, data systems, student support and transportation.\n\"KCPS has found that many of the requirements of the Blueprint come without subsequent funding sources to sufficiently cover full implementation,\" district officials wrote.\nCreated by legislation passed by the General Assembly in 2021, the Blueprint is built on five pillars: expanding pre-K to all 4-year-olds and low-income 3-year-olds, improving the teacher workforce, changing curriculums statewide to prepare students for college and careers, expanding funding and setting up a state agency to oversee it all.\nBut in those March updates, 15 of the state's 24 school districts listed funding or resource allocations among the three central challenges they face under the Blueprint.\nMeanwhile, some county officials \u2014 such as Harford County Executive Bob Cassilly \u2014 say the Blueprint is unaffordable.\n\"Unrealistic state spending mandates for the Blueprint for Education are straining local budgets statewide and should be paused and revisited,\" Cassilly said as he unveiled the county's latest budget April 15.\nNEW MANDATESWhile dramatically boosting state funding for public education over a decade, the Blueprint asks local school districts \u2014 and taxpayers \u2014 to do their part. And that is causing some concern among the state's school principals, said Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\n\"In education, one thing that sometimes happens is we get unfunded mandates, and unfunded mandates are very challenging,\" Kaufman said at a principals conference late last year.\nCounty leaders find the mandates challenging, too. In a letter to Gov. Wes Moore \u2014 a Democrat and strong supporter of the Blueprint \u2014 the Maryland Association of Counties last November listed a litany of concerns. They said the Blueprint's cost estimates don't take into account the bottom-line local impact of several major spending items, including:\nConstruction costs for additional classrooms needed under the plan's expansion of pre-K.Classroom modifications to accommodate instructional changes called for under the Blueprint plan to expand career and technical education.Additional staffing for special education students and English language learners.The new minimum $60,000 teacher salary starting in 2026 and other efforts to construct a \"career ladder\" for Maryland teachers.\nNoting that local education funding has already reached all-time highs, the Maryland Association of Counties said: \"This record county funding, combined with greater funding requirements mandated by the law, will limit counties' ability to fund competing governmental needs at basic operational levels.\"\nThe Blueprint's burden on local school districts is only beginning to be felt. By 2034, local school districts will be expected to pay $700 million more annually than they would if the Blueprint hadn't been adopted, a 2022 state report projected.\n\"As the Blueprint ramps up and the formulas increase, more and more counties will have to put more funds in because the local share will increase,\" said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board, the statewide agency created to oversee the Blueprint. \"We're just in the early first couple of years of Blueprint implementation. So it's only four or five counties that are required to put in more than they have been. But over time, it will be more than half of them.\"\nTROUBLE IN COUNTIESTo hear county officials tell it, though, the Blueprint's mandates are already leaving them in a pinch.\nWhen the Blueprint began its rollout, Dorchester County saw a $3 million jump in local funding contributions, according to County Council President Lenny Pfeffer.\n\"That $3 million jump was devastating to us,\" Pfeffer said. \"We had to pull from every resource and cut some programs that we wanted to do as far as highway maintenance, bridge maintenance and other things like that.\"\nMeanwhile in Cecil County, a school funding battle tied in part to the Blueprint led to the creation of a Facebook group \u2014 Fund CCPS \u2014 with 6,700 members.\nCecil County Executive Danielle Hornberger, a Republican, has refused to meet the school district's funding request. And last month, Hornberger filed an ethics complaint against Cecil County Schools Superintendent Jeffrey Lawson, accusing him of using public property and funds for political purposes in the budget battle.\n\"CCPS families deserve better,\" Hornberger said.\nThat prompted an angry response from Allison Stoudt, the Rising Sun High School senior who founded the Fund CCPS Facebook group. Noting that the county has funded local schools \"at the legal minimum\" for three years running and that its current budget proposal falls $13 million short of the $17 million in additional local aid the district is seeking, Stoudt called Hornberger's accusation against Lawson \"shameful.\"\nIn Worcester County, the county government has similarly refused to increase school funding above the state requirement minimums, leading to a $9 million cash shortfall that could force the district to trim between 90 and 100 staff positions.\n\"It is WCPS' belief that drastically cutting instructional staff runs contrary to the spirit of the Blueprint's goals of continual improvement and transformation in education,\" district officials said in their March Blueprint update.\nSHIFTING RESOURCESThe Blueprint calls for shifting resources within school districts at the expense of other schools.\nCarroll County Public Schools Superintendent Cynthia McCabe explained the potential ramifications of that change at a public meeting in Sykesville last year.\n\"What I don't want to be is a fearmonger, but I also don't want to get to September of 2024 and have parents calling me saying, 'Why are the class sizes so much bigger in my child's school this year?'\" McCabe said during the presentation.\nThe Blueprint shifts funding to higher-need schools in several ways.\nThe education reform plan provides \"concentration of poverty\" grants to some schools to bolster support for academics, extracurriculars, and mental and physical health. Grants are given to schools based on the number of students receiving free and reduced-price meals. In this fiscal year, 454 schools in Maryland received concentration of poverty grants, with just over one- fourth given to schools in Baltimore City.\n\"Especially the community where I serve within my district, they've benefited greatly from having concentrations of poverty funding,\" said Ashley Moore, principal at the Empowerment Academy, a charter school in Baltimore City.\nIn addition, a new requirement under the Blueprint requires students who qualify for Medicaid to automatically be enrolled in free and reduced-price school meals.\n\"This is an improvement from the standpoint of feeding kids,\" said Christopher Meyer, a research analyst at the Maryland Center on Economic Policy.\nBut shifting resources to the schools that need them leads to ramifications elsewhere.\nIn Baltimore County, for example, average class sizes will go from 25 to 24 in grades 1-3 starting in the fall, but middle school class sizes will grow from 20 to 22 while high school class sizes will increase from 21 to 23.\nAt a February media briefing, Baltimore County Schools Superintendent Myriam Rogers said elementary school class sizes have been reduced under the Blueprint because making sure students can read by third grade \"has been proven time and time again to be an indicator of success.\" In addition, she noted that fifth-graders must pass state tests on reading and math.\nAsked if the larger class sizes in other grades could negatively impact students, Rogers replied: \"No,\" saying district officials were being careful in how they were planning to adjust class sizes.\nBut McCabe, the Carroll County superintendent, reiterated her concern about class-size adjustments called for under the Blueprint.\n\"We are concerned that very large class sizes will be detrimental to student learning,\" McCabe said in an email. \"As we are seeing increased mental health concerns in our student population. It is essential that teachers have a manageable class size in order to meet the varied needs of students.\"\nTHE FUTUREThe Blueprint's long rollout period \u2014 along with the nation's post-pandemic bout with inflation \u2014 could pose other financial concerns to local school districts.\nMapping out the potential district-level impact of the Blueprint in 2022, the Maryland State Department of Legislative Services projected that 15 of the state's 24 school districts would have to increase local funding levels at some point before the Blueprint rollout is complete in 2034.\n\"The impacts are not uniform \u2026 leading several counties to need to make significant increases in their local appropriation to the boards of education in the early years, later years, or both,\" the state report said. \"Other county governments are forecast to spend about the same or slightly more than they would have otherwise.\"\nOf course, inflation could impact those projections. Meyer, the research analyst with the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, noted the Blueprint's cost projections were made before prices skyrocketed at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Actual costs in the economy have gone way up, but the funding amounts that are required under state law haven't,\" Meyer said.\nThat being the case, it's possible that some of the funding requirements in the Blueprint may be changed at some point, either by the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board or the General Assembly.\n\"No law is ever perfect,\" Maryland Education Coalition co-chair Rick Tyler Jr. said. \"We're still early in the process of what is intended to be a 10-year process.\"\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Even if the answer is no, Dr. Toughlove is sure you will enjoy the book \"Aaron Slater, Illustrator\", written by Andrea Beaty and Illustrated by David Roberts. Beaty and Roberts have produced a string of New York Times best-selling books including \"Iggy Peck, Architect\", \"Rosie Revere, Engineer\", \"Ada Twist, Scientist\", and \"Sofia Valdez, Future Prez.\"\nThis enchanting, rhyming tale is about a boy named Aaron who loves to listen to stories and dreams of writing a story someday. But when he goes to school, he struggles to learn to write. \"But the words are just squiggles, and try though he might, even with help Aaron can't get it right. Why can't I do it? Why is it so hard? He goes back to drawing on slate in his yard.\" (p. 8-9).\nAaron's self-confidence is shaken by his inability to excel at reading and writing, and his effervescent personality is transformed into a quiet, inconspicuous young boy. But in grade two, something magical happens. Aaron realizes that although writing and reading aloud is a challenge, his superpower is his ability to capture his thoughts with pictures. \"His art makes the difference. His art leads the way and helps him discover what he wants to say.\" (p. 32).\nSpeaking of pictures, the illustrations in \"Aaron Slater, Illustrator\" emanate joy and beauty and just jump off the page. Dr. Toughlove loves colorful illustrations, and this book does not disappoint. It is no wonder that David Roberts illustrations have received so much acclaim.\nIf children wish to explore art further, \"Aaron Slater's Big Project Book for Astonishing Artists\" provides additional information about how art influences our world and includes follow-up art projects as well. If you go to Andrea Beaty's website (andreabeaty.com) there are downloadable coloring sheets and other goodies available.\nThe rhyming verses in this book are also ideal for emergent readers who are working on learning how to sound out words, which is one of the cornerstones of mastering reading. \"Aaron Slater, Illustrator\" is appropriate for children aged 4-7 and is available at your county library.\nCarol Franks-Randall has a doctorate in education and is a retired educator and children's book author. She lives in Centreville and each month writes children's book reviews as Dr. Toughlove, one of the protagonists in her first book, \"Jamal and Me.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They do not acknowledge or condemn the role of Hamas (first designated as a terrorist organization in 1997 by the U.S. State Department) in launching the current and ongoing war in a long history of wars between Hamas and Israel.\nThey do not acknowledge Hamas started this war on October 7, 2023, when they killed an estimated 2,000 innocent Israeli civilians, including children; and took 250 hostages, some of whom have died in captivity.\nToday's campus protesters are rabidly antisemitic who support the goals of Hamas \u2014 reject the right of Israel to exist, drive Jews from Gaza, erase Israel as a nation, and by extension, challenge the principles and values of western society.\nThey defend their actions based in part on American constitutional rights on freedom on assembly and freedom of speech.\nThat defense is absurd.\nAmerican constitutional rights do not defend verbal harassment, threats and inflicting physical harm on Jews, Jewish students, supporters of Israel or anyone else.\nThese rights do not defend illegally occupying buildings and grounds on college campuses to disrupt learning and related school activities such as graduations.\nColleges should never permit or tolerate any advancement of antisemitism under the guise of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.\nIt's time for public officials and college administrators to walk their talk on their historical and often stated deep commitment to the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion.\nOne way to accomplish that is to share widely the following story of Martin Niem\u00f6ller, a theologian and minister in Germany before, during and after World War II.\nBefore the war, Niem\u00f6ller, like many Germans, resented how Germany was treated after World War I. Niem\u00f6ller was active in antisemitic political parties and organizations. He was enthusiastic about the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and voted for the Nazi party in 1933.\nEarly on during World War II he was aware of the Nazi's persecution of other Europeans, but he remained silent. Niem\u00f6ller was especially supportive of persecution of members of political movements with whom he disagreed.\nLater during the war, Niem\u00f6ller helped launch a new church denomination that opposed the Nazification of German Protestant churches. That led to his being sent to a concentration camp for seven years where he narrowly avoided being executed.\nFollowing the war, Niem\u00f6ller went on a speaking tour throughout Germany. On that tour, he acknowledged and expressed great remorse over the impact of his own inaction on and indifference to the fate of victims in the Holocaust.\nNiem\u00f6ller included the following remarks in his presentations about the German Nazis:\nFirst, they came for the communists. I did not speak out because I was not a communist.\nThen, they came for the socialists. I did not speak out because I was not a socialist.\nThen, they came for the unionists. I did not speak out because I was not a unionist.\nThen, they came for the Jews. I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.\nThen, they came for me, and there was no one left to speak out for me.\nOver the years, Niem\u00f6ller varied the names of the groups the Nazis came for prior to coming for him. Sometimes he mentioned all the above groups and other times he selectively replaced them with others such as people with mental and physical disabilities and Jehovah's Witnesses. That was the universe he was aware of at that time.\nToday, our list could include the same groups plus other ethnic groups, the elderly, children, progressives, conservatives, liberals or virtually any readily identifiable group in our society.\nRegardless of using his original list, a revised list, or a combination list from both, Niem\u00f6ller's overall message is as important today as when he first delivered it.\nAnother message that is as important today as when first expressed by philosopher George Santayana who warned \"Those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it.\"\nIt is my hope that sooner rather than later, college students, college leaders, elected officials and the American public will become more aware of and learn from Niem\u00f6ller's history with antisemitism and will also heed Santayana's warning.\nThe messages from both are simple yet profound and timely.\nWe must not be silent, indifferent or inactive in response to hatred whenever it is directed at any of the groups identified above; plus any others I may have inadvertently missed.\nLikewise, we must accept if we do not learn from history, we are condemned to repeat it.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Teachers would spin a wheel, and the number that they get would correlate to a challenge. The challenges included writing a paragraph of praise to a fellow teacher and sending it to the principal to give the message anonymously.\nHaley Wright, a teacher at Maple Elementary, said she had a lot of fun this week. She enjoyed the appreciation she received from staff and the chance to connect with other teachers at the school.\n\"It allows teachers who may not always see each other or maybe they're able to establish new friendships among their staff members. The kids really get into it,\" Wright said. \"On their morning announcements, students asked staff to ask us, 'Did we spin the wheel?' 'What challenge are we going to work on today?' So I think it also allows for the students to get excited about it, too.\"\nNatalie Drake, teacher at Maple Elementary, said she enjoyed the work that the administration put into this week, especially while making it a team activity. Drake described how teachers and support staff were split into teams to earn points to be the winning team at the end of the week.\nBy far, Drake's favorite part was feeling seen by other teachers and staff at the school.\n\"I did receive one of those anonymous emails today, and that really just put a smile on my face,\" Drake said. \"Other people here at school recognize the hard work that we all put in. They're very appreciative of all that we do here. So not just our administration appreciates us, but also our colleagues are appreciative of us.\"\nFor Ford, teachers work hard all year, and with standardized testing, it is easy for everyone to feel a bit burned out this time of the year. These events are meant to refresh everyone and provide a positive outlet for energy for teachers, staff and students.\n\"Teaching is hard. But it's fun, and it's rewarding,\" Ford said. \"I enjoy seeing my teachers in action, their passion, and you can truly tell that they care about all of their students, and it just makes me feel good. It makes me proud to be the principal here and just proud to be able to work with such amazing educators.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I have purposely waited to announce my candidacy because I was curious what type of hate I was going to start to encounter.Well ... the Star Democrat has wasted no time with starting to blatantly attack my character because Moms for Liberty is endorsing me. Jim Johnson (editor) wrote an article (May 5) stating that he \"wished the local candidates had taken the time to write about stances on issues.\" Well, Mr. Johnson, if you remember the phone call I made to you the other day (Wednesday), you would be amiss to remember that I stated that I was still seeking to learn input from parents around the area on their concerns with schools and education, that I was finishing four college courses related to my jobs in nursing and real estate, was focusing on getting my volunteer work aligned and preparing for surgery so I could start campaigning in June. I also told you I had emailed the writer and told her I would be happy to meet with face to face to discuss her questions.\nSo don't start questioning my character, ideologies, or stance on anything just because I didn't feel I was prepared to answer your questions at the time and a group you claim to \"pose a threat\" is giving me support. Maybe you pose a threat more with your own biased hatred and to know you haven't even met me yet.\nSince I posted this on Facebook first, I haven't been let down with the haters. Wow. And they call Moms for Liberty hateful ... go figure!\nKARLA WIELAND-CHERRY\nTrappe \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But the reality is that, at the national level, their party remains the principal roadblock to any meaningful, long-term solutions.To understand all this, it's necessary to consider the broad contours of the crisis. During and following the pandemic, many child care centers closed, and many areas of the country, known as \"child care deserts,\" today have critical shortages of licensed slots for children.\nMeanwhile, thousands of centers remain under-enrolled because operators can't afford to pay early childhood educators competitive wages. At an average hourly rate of $13.71 in 2022, early childhood educators are among the lowest paid workers in the country.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, child care should constitute no more than 7% of a family's income, but costs for a family with two children in care can range anywhere from 10% to 33% of a family's budget, exceeding rental and mortgage costs in many states.\nJust last month, Congress passed, and the president signed, a $1.2 trillion funding bill that included almost $9 billion for child care and $12 billion for Headstart, the early childhood program for low-income families. But even those funds will serve a relatively small fraction of eligible families, and the state-level fixes, helpful as they are, will only go so far.\nRepublicans have resisted more substantive solutions to the child care crisis out of a familiar opposition to many, if not most, forms of social spending \u2014 sometimes labeling them \"socialist,\" other times describing child care itself as disruptive to traditional family roles, that is a mother at home. The net result places the burden of care on individuals and individual families, a proposition that works only for the most affluent.\nThe alternative is to recognize \u2014 as many European countries do \u2014 that high quality care, whether for small children or for the elderly, is a collective responsibility. This idea is the essence of what many call a \"caring society,\" a society that enshrines care as a human right and that values the well-being of all individuals, all families, no matter what their socio-economic status may be.\nBut for millions, the child care crisis remains a troubling problem that won't solve itself. Alternatives beckon; other possibilities for a caring society beckon. Will these inspire action?\nAndrew Moss, syndicated by PeaceVoice, writes on labor, nonviolence, and culture from Los Angeles.

    "content": "Moms For Liberty advocates for school parents\n\n May 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JAN GREENHAWK | Section: Columns \n \n 798\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In his column in the Easton Star Democrat, Sunday, May 5, Executive Editor Jim Johnson wrote an article entitled, \"Moms For Liberty fields candidates in clections.\"I am the current chapter chair for Moms For Liberty Talbot. Mr. Johnson made no attempt to contact me to verify or discuss any of the information contained in his article.\nMoms For Liberty Talbot encourages people to run for school board and other political offices. We feel the more choices people have, the better. Although we didn't \"field\" the candidates mentioned we certainly sent out a call for people to run in the districts that are open for election in 2024. It is a sad situation when a candidate for any position runs unopposed.\nJohnson states, \"Voters need to know that three candidates for the Talbot County Board of Education are backed by Moms For Liberty, a group that has raised questions across the country and stirred controversy with its views.\"\nNeither Moms For Liberty Talbot nor the national organization Moms For Liberty has made an official endorsement or backed any candidates in the Talbot school board races. That doesn't mean we won't support board candidates at a certain point, but we are not at this time. We like to do our research and get to know the candidates first.\nMr. Johnson could have made a simple phone call to me to find out our status on endorsements or backing candidates, but he did not.\nI can't speak for any of the candidates regarding their responses or lack thereof to the Star Democrat \"questionnaire,\" but I will remind Mr. Johnson that since there are not three candidates in either of the districts, there is no meaningful primary in any of them. Therefore, a candidate can wait until closer to the election to share their opinions with any of the many groups that send out questionnaires.\nThe Star Democrat is a newspaper, Mr. Johnson, not an official arbiter of how candidates should conduct their campaign or when they should answer questions from any group in an election year.\nOur local chapter has scheduled and will offer an opportunity to all school board candidates to meet voters and answer questions in a forum in the fall closer to the election. Invitations will be sent to all candidates prior to that event.\nMr. Johnson is wrong in his portrayal of Moms For Liberty. He says we are controversial. I guess when you advocate for parents instead of unions and special interest groups, you are called controversial.\nAs Mr. Johnson picked descriptors of Moms For Liberty, he used biased, disproven allegations from The Associated Press and an extremely liberal politics professor from Virginia. These descriptions don't address the reality that Moms For Liberty supports parental rights which allow parents a seat at the decision-making table for the educational, medical and mental health decisions made regarding their children.\nMoms For Liberty is dedicated to helping all parents be aware of what is happening in the schools so they can assert their rights in the educational decision-making process.\nDid Mr. Johnson ask any local education officials about how we work with them in Talbot County? Doubtful.\nAs the local chair of Moms For Liberty, I meet often with Talbot County officials including Superintendent of Schools Dr. Pepukayi. We discuss the many issues, questions and concerns of parents in the county. It is always a positive dialogue and very beneficial.\nDr. Pepukayi and school board President Emily Jackson attend our member meetings periodically to answer questions and have discussions. Dr. Pepukayi has done so twice; Emily Jackson once. All three of these events were an opportunity to share ideas in a respectful, positive manner. Does Mr. Johnson know we have a good relationship with both and with many people in the local school district?\nWe attend school board meetings so that we know what is going on in our schools. We are often supportive of our school board and have joined with them in the past to oppose state legislation that would diminish their role in local control of the schools.\nFor a candidate to answer questions created arbitrarily by a reporter eight months from the election is counterproductive and, quite frankly, not very smart. Issues can change so much between now and then. Maybe the better question is why the Star Democrat put out the questionnaire so early in the election year especially since there is no real primary in any of the school board races.\nOverall, Mr. Johnson's opinion piece is being used to target a group he doesn't like and to prejudice voters against candidates he doesn't know. He does this with lies, distortions and omissions.\nMaybe he should sit down and talk with the candidates and also our group. Moms For Liberty Talbot will await his call.\nJan Greenhawk is the chapter chair of Moms For Liberty Talbot.

The group only later joined the M4L organization.\nMany parents are dismayed that kids are being taught they are either \"oppressors\" or \"oppressed\" depending on their race. They are being told such things as \"boys can have babies\" and that people can actually change their gender ... in school. Trans boys were allowed to compete against girls in sports and use female bathrooms.\nThey are finding books in their children's elementary school libraries with sexually explicit photos of every imaginable sex act. If we want books removed, it is this kind of book to which we are objecting. (Banning books like Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, I find objectionable.)\nSince the school \"report cards\" came out and showed dismal proficiency scores in math and English for all grade levels in Talbot County, a major concern of the group.\nThe Maryland Board of Education Blueprint for the Future (with its mandates regarding some of these issues that are tied to school funding) is another major concern.\nMoms for Liberty of Talbot would like to support Talbot school board candidates who have these issues front and center. People who can think out of the box and find solutions that have been elusive when following the national and state agendas. We want a school board that will demand proficiency at all grade levels.\nI am not aware of any candidates that have been endorsed by Moms for Liberty to date.\nAbove and beyond all else Moms for Liberty stresses parents' rights to have a major voice in their children's education and the major say in their social and sexual upbringing. M4L members believe that schools are there to teach our kids how to think critically, not what to think.\nI suggest that you and your staff do some basic research before printing.\nKENT ROBERTSON\nRoyal Oak \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This trust is founded in my own experiences. Kindly leave our children alone, Moms for Liberty.\nMoms for Liberty is an extremist organization grounded in advocacy for issues that are irrelevant and misplaced in Talbot County. Moms for Liberty advocates against rights for all, complicating issues around equality, ethnicity, advocating for book bans in school, and opposing common sense, scientifically grounded health care policies in schools.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that tracks extremism, has designated them an extremist group. Moms for Liberty is jamming the zone with rhetoric and conspiracy, purposefully misguiding those who listen and downplaying the everyday achievements made by our school system including the successes of our staff and students. They are a growing organization with chapters across the country. Talbot County's chapter chooses to be affiliated with this organization and proudly trumpets that affiliation.\nIt's important to understand the candidates that Moms for Liberty is endorsing in Talbot County, as these candidates will become a mouthpiece of the organization, and continue to propagate anti-education, anti-diversity rhetoric.\nAs the Star Democratic reminded us, candidates recruited and endorsed by Moms for Liberty in Talbot County include:\nAnne O'Conner.Kerry Gunshenan.Karla Wieland Cherry.\nAt best, these candidates are accepting an endorsement from this divisive, extremist organization that has no place in our county, without understanding what that endorsement means. At worst, these candidates subscribe to this unhinged web of lies and will play an active role in their conspiracies.\nEither way, I do not support these candidates, nor should you.\nTOTCH HARTGE\nEaston \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In absolute terms, St. Mary's charges lower tuition than it did in the 2013-2014 academic year \u2014 a difference magnified significantly by inflation over that period of more than 30%, according to a release from the college.\nThe board-approved increase of 3.9% for room and board reflects the increased costs of goods and services as well as an increase in the Maryland minimum wage.\nThe meeting was led for the final time by outgoing Chair Susan L. Dyer, who completed the maximum three-year term. A commercial real estate developer and managing partner in a restaurant in Leonardtown, Dyer has more than 30 years of experience as a recognized leader and expert in information technology strategy, design, development and delivery of large-scale business and scientific systems.\n\"It has been my absolute pleasure to serve as chair of this outstanding board of trustees and our equally amazing faculty and exceptional staff,\" Dyer said. \"Under the tremendous vision and leadership of President Jordan, we have consistently focused on determining the best outcomes for our students, which truly reflects the heart of this institution.\"\nUnder Dyer's leadership, the trustees oversaw significant positive changes, including maintaining the aforementioned tuition freeze and long-range tuition strategy, the approval of new academic majors, the approval of the three-year Rising Tide strategic plan and an upgrade of the college's credit rating, according to the release.\nDyer will be replaced as chair by John Bell, a 1995 graduate of St. Mary's College who is the managing director of Wells Fargo Corporate & Investment Bank. Bell is the first alumnus to chair the board of trustees.\nThe board was informed by Jordan of her decision to retire in June 2025, and of the transition of the college's Taking the LEAD fundraising campaign to a How High Can We Fly phase for its final year after eclipsing its initial goal of $20 million a year ahead of schedule.\n\"Ten years ago, I said 'now is the time'\u2014the time to become a model of what higher education can achieve, the time for us \u2014 the invisible \u2014 to become visible,\" Jordan, who as appointed president of the college in 2014, said. \"I am immensely proud of our shared accomplishments including the increasing diversity of our student body, steady enrollment growth, curricular and co-curricular innovations, the focus on an expanding campus culture where everyone can thrive, and deeper partnerships with the broader community.\"\nThe board also approved the 2024-2025 meeting calendar, the awarding of degrees to the Class of 2024, a new attendance policy, diversity report, state capital budget proposal and its authority and responsibility matrix. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Will Maryland\u2019s Blueprint for education work?\n\n May 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LIZZY ALSPACH and APURVA MAHAJAN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1394\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland plans to spend $16.6 billion through 2029, along with billions more after that, to improve its public schools.But will it work?\nState legislators created a seven-member oversight board to ensure it would.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a transformative education law passed in 2021, aims to boost student performance and education quality throughout Maryland schools. It outlines these goals in five pillars: the expansion of prekindergarten, the hiring and retention of high-quality and diverse teachers and leaders, college and career readiness, additional resources, and accountability and governance.\nLawmakers established the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board to monitor the Blueprint's progress. The board oversees funding and initiative implementation while providing guidance to school districts, all with the intention of improving academic performance in Maryland.\n\"I think part of it is just understanding that we can do better, we need to do better and we're going to do better,\" said Rachel Hise, executive director of the accountability board. \"That's the promise of the Blueprint.\"\nSchool leaders across the state tend to agree \u2014 but they said the Blueprint comes with complications that go beyond the financial challenges it poses to the state and its 24 public school districts. Educators said they're concerned about the Blueprint's deadlines, a lack of detailed procedural information and the plan's overall place in the educational system.\n\"Implementing a law as comprehensive as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future is going to be a herculean effort under the best of circumstances,\" Baltimore City Public Schools officials wrote in their May 1 report to the accountability board. \"But combined with the added complexities of pandemic recovery, delays that resulted in extremely limited pre-implementation planning time for districts, and the slow pace of regulations and guidance pertaining to the Blueprint, the challenges are amplified.\"\nAssessing the BlueprintThe Accountability and Implementation Board will oversee the progress of each public school system in implementing Blueprint initiatives.\nThe board is by law required to:\nDevelop a plan to fully implement the Blueprint in public school systems, complete with timelines and deadlines.Monitor the progress school districts and the state are making regarding the Blueprint by reporting annually on 92 data measures, which collect information on student performance, teacher preparation and outcomes backed by Blueprint funding.Determine if changes need to be made to the plan to achieve the plan's original goals.Ensure \"Expert Review Teams\" of teachers, faculty and staff observe schools and understand how to make recommendations about changing how the plan is implemented.Release about a quarter of Blueprint funds each year to school systems that are implementing initiatives properly.Hire an independent contractor to evaluate the Blueprint's success.Ensure school systems demonstrate at least 75% of funding received per student follows the students to their school.\nUnder the law, the accountability board can withhold funding from school systems that fail to implement Blueprint initiatives or show significant student progress.\nThe board holds routine meetings to hear from Marylanders. It also has a series of advisory groups to gather feedback from teachers, parents, students and other stakeholders, according to Laura Stapleton, a board member and chair of the University of Maryland's Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methodology.\n\"There's so many moving parts,\" Stapleton said. \"Many different stakeholders are needed to implement all the various parts of the Blueprint.\"\nStretching deadlinesEvery Maryland public school district is responsible for rolling out Blueprint initiatives and collecting each of the 92 different data measures for the Accountability and Implementation Board to evaluate, Stapleton said.\nBut school district officials said none of that is easy.\n\"With educational reform of this scale, it is difficult to keep up with the constant changes, timelines and work of each pillar,\" Carroll County school district leaders said in their May 1 submission to the accountability board.\nJanine Bacquie, Montgomery County Public Schools' Blueprint implementation coordinator, said her district is straining to properly gather data and implement Blueprint initiatives within allocated deadlines.\n\"We're struggling to get the guidance that we need to do the work that we need to do with a short timeline,\" Bacquie said. \"If we had another year or two, it'd certainly take some of the pressure off.\"\nAll 24 school districts were originally required to submit their final Blueprint implementation plans by March 2024.\nBut because the state provided necessary materials \u2014 such as report templates and expectations \u2014 to districts only two months before the March deadline, the submission schedule was revised.\nThe March deadline was changed so it only had to be a 10-page preliminary report, according to Bacquie. The final report deadline was then pushed back to May 1.\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board is facing a tough deadline, too. According to Stapleton, an independent contractor is set to perform an evaluation of the Blueprint by October.\nBut Stapleton said she hopes the deadline for the evaluation can be pushed back a few years to give the Blueprint's many initiatives more time to lead to change.\nA slow flow of informationMeanwhile, Blueprint information seems to move slowly to and through the state's school districts.\n\"Because the implementation of Blueprint is massive and encompasses the entire district, one of the biggest challenges is communicating with employees the ways in which their work already aligns with the Blueprint,\" Prince George's County school officials said in their March 2024 submission to the accountability board.\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board holds regular meetings on Zoom for anyone to attend. All meetings are held online and published in an online archive for anyone to view.\nBut Javier Valera, a math content specialist at a public middle school in Montgomery County, said he and other teachers have no clue about the depth of information in the Blueprint.\nHe said the state should work harder to keep teachers informed.\nChanges are coming next year, \"and we don't even know anything about it,\" Valera said. \"It is concerning, because we are going to be the ones implementing the plan. \u2026 There should be more transparency and they need to talk with us and let us know what is this about.\"\nSparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George's County, echoed Valera's sentiments about a need for more details about the Blueprint.\n\"There's a lot of information that definitely needs to be clarified,\" Jefferson said. \"I think it needs to be disseminated in a clear, concise manner where of course our principals are able to understand \u2014 and understand the impact that it has for each school.\"\nMembers of the accountability board encourage community members to provide feedback. Principals, parents and teachers are urged to reach out about the Blueprint, Rachel Amstutz, the accountability board's policy director, said at a principals conference late last year.\n\"We need to hear from the local level what's happening and what you need,\" Amstutz said. \"We need to hear from our parents what's working for their kids and what isn't.\"\nLingering concernsImplementing the Blueprint hasn't gone exactly as planned so far. Deadlines for criteria and implementation plans have been extended at least three times. And in district-level Blueprint plans submitted this spring, school officials across the state expressed a variety of concerns.\n\"From funding uncertainties to staffing shortages and delays in receiving critical guidance, the district must navigate various obstacles to ensure the successful execution of Blueprint initiatives,\" Caroline County school officials said in their March submission to the accountability board.\nMeanwhile, school officials in Allegany County said workforce issues make implementing the Blueprint a challenge. \"Sustaining district-level initiatives across all schools is difficult because of staff retirements and turnover rates,\" officials wrote in their May 1 report.\nIn their Blueprint update, St. Mary's County school officials said they are concerned about all the elements of public education the Blueprint ignores. Other crucial parts of the learning experience could see funding cuts as the district strives to meet the Blueprint's mandates, they said.\n\"The ubiquitous challenge inherent in meeting Blueprint goals is in the fact that the Blueprint is silent on supporting all else, i.e., the arts, athletics, enrichment and after-school programming, transportation, facilities, health care, etc.,\" St. Mary's County school officials wrote. \"These elements of school are necessary and imperative in supporting the whole child.\"\nAmid all the concerns, Bacquie, Montgomery County's Blueprint coordinator, said further delays may be necessary. The rush to complete various measures in the Blueprint could render the plan to reinvent Maryland's public schools less effective than it could otherwise be, she said.\n\"It's not something where you just come in and say something's going to change overnight,\" Bacquie said. \"You're changing hearts, thoughts, minds, strategies.\"\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That doesn't mean, as everybody may think, that we're going to react with violence. We're going to react with education.\"\nAccording to a letter signed by Baltimore's Masjid Ad-Da'wah Ilat Tawheed Imam Raha Batts, the videos shows Gibbs \"being verbally and physically attacked with her hijab being violently snatched from her head.\"\nThe letter says that those involved chanted Islamic phrases to \"taunt\" Gibbs. It also says Gibbs was physically assaulted in the presence of the assailant's father.\nGibbs' mom, LaToya Gibbs, said in an interview May 9 that it's been heartbreaking and devastating to see her daughter go through this.\n\"It's been really hard on her mental health and mine,\" she said.\nShe said Tori Gibbs will be doing home hospital schooling through the end of the year due to her mental health.\nCarter said that when he saw the video, he felt outrage.\n\"Everybody should feel safe,\" he said.\nAt the barbecue, organizers grilled hamburgers and hot dogs and offered pamphlets and books about Islam for people to peruse.\nAlong with offering learning opportunities to people in the community, Carter said they came to help foster a peaceful resolution between the children and parents involved in the incident. He said he was able to help make that happen in the early afternoon before the barbecue began.\n\"We're not protesting or anything like that,\" Carter said about the event. \"But we are calling for change. We're calling for education, and we're calling for change.\"\nThe same day as the barbecue, LaToya Gibbs said she and faith leaders sat down with Dorchester County Public Schools Interim Superintendent Jymil Thompson. Although she said the district had given her \"the runaround\" in the past, she said the meeting was a positive one.\n\"Unfortunately it took for my brothers and sisters to make a post and bring more awareness than I could,\" she said about finally getting that meeting.\nLaToya Gibbs said that at the meeting, she talked to Thompson about how better communication with parents could have stopped the situation from getting as bad as it did.\nAccording to a statement from DCPS, Thompson called the meeting constructive and said the Gibbs family's concerns were taken seriously.\n\"The school and community need to work together to prevent small issues becoming big,\" he said about Imam Raha Batts' suggestion to work together on a bullying awareness program. \"It is sensible to use school, where the community's youngsters come together, to further education against bullying. I look forward to working with the Imam on this project.\"\nIn an email, DCPS Communications and Community Outreach Specialist Valerie Goff said that following the meeting, Thompson will be monitoring the situation and checking in with the family.\nIn an interview May 9, Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd said that on April 5 the department began investigating the incident, which took place outside a Mace's Lane Middle student's home on March 26. He said police did a detailed investigation that included getting video footage of the incident from social media and from city street cameras.\nTodd said Rian Johnson, a parent of one of the children involved in the incident, has been charged with conspiracy of assault in the second degree, conspiracy of reckless endangerment, reckless endangerment and contributing to the condition of a child. He said one of the children involved was identified as a juvenile offender but has not been charged. He said the Dorchester County State's Attorney is looking into whether the offender's actions could be considered a hate crime.\nLaToya Gibbs said the community barbecue resulted in five attendees taking their Shahada, which means they made the decision to convert to Islam. She said two of those five attendees were the fathers of girls in the video that showed Tori Gibbs being attacked.\nTori Gibbs' great aunt, Kandy Waller, said she just wants her niece to be OK. She said the bullying has been a constant, and she hopes the barbecue results in an end to the bullying and harassment.\n\"I just want her to be able to enjoy her childhood like everybody else without the threat of violence,\" Waller said.\nLaToya Gibbs said the barbecue had a positive effect on her Tori.\n\"She did say she was more confident (seeing) all the people come together and show support for her,\" LaToya Gibbs said.\nThis story has been updated to include comments from DCPS. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was in her second year of teaching.\n\"Her loss leaves a big hole in the heart of Sandy Hill Elementary School,\" the letter says.\nCockey \u2014 who also coached the school's cheer team \u2014 was high-energy, friendly and lively, Gibson writes in the letter.\n\"Even if you're child was not a student of Miss Cockey, they will probably know her as she was very engaged with the life of the school,\" Gibbson said.\nBefore coming to Sandy Hill to teach, Cockey interned at Vienna Elementary School during the 2021 to 2022 school year, Dorchester County Public Schools communications and community outreach specialist Valerie Goff said.\nAccording to an email from Maryland State Police, a preliminary investigation found that Cockey \u2014 who was traveling westbound on U.S. Route 50 near Maryland Route 347 in Hebron \u2014 drifted left for unknown reasons and partially entered a left turn lane, striking the rear of a box truck. MSP said Cockey continued to travel through the center median, going west across the eastbound Route 50 lanes and sideswiping a Mazda CX-4 before coming to a stop in a field.\nCockey was pronounced dead on the scene. No other deaths or injuries were reported in the ongoing investigation.\nGoff said that along with notifying the school community of Cockey's death via a letter, Gibson called and spoke with each of the families of Cockey's students.\nOn Thursday morning, students and staff began the day in small classroom circle discussions to share their feelings and offer support.\nGoff said education psychologists, social workers and counselors from other schools were brought to the school, as well as external partners like Mid Shore Mediation, Life's Energy Wellness Center and Mobile Crisis.\nGoff said these extra supports would be available to students and staff on Friday, and from there, the school would \"play it by ear.\"\n\"People are on call, so they'll be coming in on an as-needed basis,\" she said.\nIn the classroom circles, the extra counselors, social workers, psychologists and partners were great in supporting teachers, Goff said. She said some teachers were still in shock about the loss of their colleague.\n\"It was great having that extra support there at the school, both from other schools and from, as I said, our external partners,\" she said.\nTeachers were given resources about grief to use with their students.\nGoff said that students \u2014 particularly fourth and fifth graders \u2014 have started conversations about how the school community can memorialize Cockey.\n\"There are going to be plans about that,\" she said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Foremost, salary increases, with the next priority to address health insurance cost increases (approximately 8%), and an increase in utilities; adjusting for what was also an increase in FY24, and subsequently adjusted for in FY25.\n\"It was a very tight and very concerning push and shove\u2026for coming up with the budget,\" Couch said.\nAdding to the challenge, everything is placed in designated line items now, Couch said, referring to the requirements coming from the Accountability and Implementation Board (another component of the Blueprint) that dictates how funds are allocated and prevents the transfer of funds among categories.\n\"Right now we can't see how it's going to work and its going to be very muddy and its going to be devastating I think unless something changes,\" she said, The AIB consultant is very much aware of this problem and can help us try to figure it out.\nOf the proposed budget, \"This is what I believe what we need to operate our school system,\" Couch said. \"If we don't get the money to make this budget, we will need to figure out what we can do without.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Lewis explained, face recognition, data syphoning and micro targeting are all algorithms AI uses to collect and generate information.\nAI is already being used to suppress votes, strengthen division and create narratives and realistic fake news, he said.\nPredicting 2024 will see more voters in polls across the world than any other point in history, and noting \"You can't spell campaign without AI,\" Lewis believes AI will only continue to grow during the election periods and give way to periods of false information spreading raapidly.\n\"The scary part of AI is how realistic it can appear,\" he said.\nCrucial pillars for the path forward include information literacy, informed citizenry, civic learning and personal and political virtue, according to Lewis.\n\"Moral finger wagging\" is an essential aspect of a functioning democracy and areas of \"news deserts\" with little to no local media coverage are particularly vulnerable and susceptible to misinformation, according to Lewis.\n\"Reliable information is often behind a paywall while bad information is often free,\" he noted.\nHowever, as fast as AI is adapting, so is the world.\nThrough \"information inoculation,\" students are learning to be more proactive and less vulnerable to false information and media manipulation, Lewis said.\nThe Gunston School has set a multi-year goal to evaluate and upgrade its approach to civic learning and civic education to help students better understand AI, he said.\nLewis teaches Advanced Placement U.S. Government and has adapted his homework assignments to combat AI's ability to write term papers, he said.\nAlthough scary and uncertain, like the internet, AI has opened doors into new perspectives and benefits including modern medicine.\nLewis strongly advocated for always researching before sharing information.\n\"The takeaway is how powerful this really is,\" he said.\nWhile future technology may be less than uncertain, the dedication of organizations like the League of Women Voters keep democracy alive and thriving in an informed community, according to Lewis.\nThe League of Women Voters is a non-partisan organization that works to encourage informed and active participation in government and works to increase understanding of national, state and local public policy through education and advocacy.\nCurrently 60 members strong, the League is active in community voter services including voter registration events and printing voter guides.\nIn addition to the presentation and meeting, the League offered guides on voting and governmental officials.\nPresident Liz Hammond encouraged everyone to spread the word of the crucial importance of voting and making a difference in democracy.\n\"It is disheartening whenever we hear from people who say they don't vote,\" Hammond said.\nMore information including a quarterly newsletter can be found at lwvqac.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester BOE passes emergency virtual education plan with amendment\n\n May 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 647\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 A drafted prolonged state of emergency virtual education plan, now required by the state through a Maryland Senate bill, brought discussion among the Dorchester County Board of Education at a board meeting Thursday.Dorchester County Public Schools' Jodi Colman, the director of curriculum, instruction and assessment, said the drafted plan includes information about staffing, personnel, student instruction and assessment and learning supports in the event of an emergency that is longer than 14 consecutive days. The plan can be amended as needed when entering into a state of emergency, she said.\n\"The purpose of this is in case something like COVID happened,\" she said about the plan.\nColman said the district needs to submit its plan to the Maryland State Department of Education by June 1.\nAfter Colman talked about why the plan is needed, board member Talibah Chikwendu asked why the draft plan requires that content supervisors are invited into Schoology classrooms, a school management system that connects students and teachers online.\nChikwendu said as a teacher, she puts multiple plans in different places and adjusts those plans based on what she's seeing in the classroom and how students are doing. She said she doesn't like the idea of someone else being able to go into the Schoology classroom and possibly move around or delete things.\n\"Especially if I'm going to be held accountable or made responsible for what is in there,\" she said.\nBoard member Sheri Hubbard asked if this is something content supervisors have access to now. Chikwendu said that they did not currently have that access and that it needs to be given upon request.\n\"Which certainly they could request and certainly a teacher should do,\" Chikwendu said. \"But they don't automatically have it. This plan says that they automatically have to do this, and I don't like that.\"\nColman said her intention for including that line in the plan was to be a support for teachers and not so that supervisors could go into Schoology and make changes.\n\"As you're wearing your teacher hat, if you're not seeing that as a support, that's not what I was going for,\" Colman said to Chikwendu.\nChikwendu said she agreed with offering it as a support but did not like the idea of making it mandatory. The board voted to approve the prolonged emergency virtual education plan on the condition that the content supervisor line is amended to be offered as support rather than mandatory.\nBefore the board passed the plan, the subject of camera usage in virtual classrooms was also brought up. In the plan, it says that cameras need to be turned on in the event that classes become virtual.\nChikwendu said she understood why having cameras on is important, but brought up concerns with bandwidth.\n\"When you have a classroom of even 15 students and all of their cameras are on and your camera is on, the bandwidth is horrible,\" she said, later adding, \"I get why we need to turn them on, I'm just wondering how we manage the bandwidth issues that come with keeping a whole class together for the period of time the Google Meet is on if we have all those kids' cameras on at the same time.\"\nColman said she went back and forth on this aspect of the plan. She said the district learned with the COVID-19 pandemic that not requiring cameras to be on creates a lack of accountability. She said a sentence could be added to the plan to explain that cameras can be turned off in the event of wifi or bandwidth issues.\nChikwendu said she just wanted to make sure everyone was aware of the issue.\nThe board also talked about students not feeling comfortable with classmates and teachers seeing their homes in the background in virtual classroom settings. Hubbard suggested using a standard background for all students on camera so that students' homes aren't in view. Colman said this was something the district could do. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

But beyond the library's physical appearance, the renovation project was designed to help the library continue to function as a hub of the community, offering a variety of programming for library patrons of different ages.\n\"We have got gaming stations in the teen zone and for adults we have study rooms and zoom meetings for tutoring,\" Nancy Pollen, a library associate said. \"We make it so much fun. We have puppet programs and read to a beagle.\"\nThe group gathered for a ribbon cutting amidst the stacks of books.\nYears of effort went into raising money and designing the new space. An architect of the project, Connie Kumor of RMM Architects, brought her family to the grand opening.\n\"A lot of the design was making the space more friendly and open,\" Kumor said. \"When we started the project, especially the children's area, there was a big dividing wall right down the middle, and there were no restrooms for families to use while they were in this space, and the lighting levels were a bit tough for a library environment. We really wanted to open up the space for everybody and make it more inviting.\"\nKumor said that all the renovation work was done to the interior and that the original footprint of the building did not change. She noted that Executive Director Debbie Bennett has been planning this project for a long time, and Kumor was happy to see it completed.\nBennett, who is retiring at the end of June after decades of service, was whirling around in the midst of many wellwishers.\n\"This is terribly exciting,\" Bennett said. \"We started in the fiscal year of 2019. We did a space utilization study and a design plan, then the renovation of the first floor, finally the replacement of the slate on the back pitched roof and a major upgrade on the elevator.\"\nShe said that this is one of her major legacies. It continued the effort that was started by the library founder John Hargreaves in 1961.\nShe also cited the Maryland State Library Capital Grant and all political support the library got from state legislators. There were also several large donations and hundreds of small donations from the community.\n\"We have a small but mighty Friends of the Library,\" Bennett said. \"I asked them to raise $50,000 for furniture, which wasn't included in the grant. They raised $78,000.\"\nIrene Padilla, the state librarian who was present at the ribbon cutting, said, \"We know what a great resource this is for Caroline County. Libraries play an important role in the success of any community.\n\"Beyond the 1,000s of books that you have on your shelves, there is the access to computers, the internet, makerspace, printing services and a myriad of digital resources. Thank you to the professional staff. We all need their help to succeed in the 20th century.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Sodexo contract was set to expire on June 30 and QACPS is now joining 22 other school systems that run in-house food-service programs in their districts.\nAs of July 2024, QACPS food services will be self-operational and no longer operated by Sodexo as a food service management company. In order to be self operational, a vendor contract is needed to provide the necessary food and items which is currently being procured through the district's food service management company, according to Hickey.\nThe district looks to save money in aspects such as management, by going self operational, she said, and will be joining forces with MSEC to join in a contract with Sysco.\nCaroline County put forth a bid for food and food related items and Sysco was the only bid received, Hickey said.\nThe MSEC contract contains a clause for Queen Anne's to partner and utilize the services. The contract was recently renewed for the third year to begin July 2024 with two more years of renewal options, she said.\nThe total estimated cost for FY25 is $800,000 and will utilize the food service balance account, according to Hickey.\nFood service department staff have been notified of the district's conversion to self-operational and have been given the opportunity to ask questions.\n\"No hourly positions are being cut and they are all encouraged to reapply when the positions become available, \" Hickey said.\nBoard member Richard Smith noted, \"I was back in the day when we had it in-house, then we went out, now we're back in.\"\nWhile the operational budget may not look different within the first year, Hickey emphasized, \"What we're doing is keeping that money in the county, and being able to prioritize and utilize local vendors which it cannot do right now,\" she said. By October, the district hopes to have a partnership with a local vendor in time for Homegrown School Week.\nIn addition to the cost savings, Board President Helen Bennet was particularly excited about the prospect of partnering with local farms, particularly for the benefit of FFA, and looked forward to updates as it moved forward.\nThe board's approval of the contract was necessary as the district needs to begin ordering food for summer programs and the start of next school year, Hickey said.\nIt was also noted, as the district shifts away from its current food service management company Sodexo, so too does its milk distributor service contract and the BOE approved piggybacking off of the MSEC milk contract with Cloverland Dairy.\nCloverland is QACPS's current milk provider through the Sodexo, so the approval just brings a different contract, Hickey said.\nPricing on half pints of regular milk are estimated to be better with the piggybacking contract, Hickey said.\nWicomico County Public Schools put the public bid out for milk delivery and the contract contains a piggyback clause for QACPS to jump on, she said.\nThe total price is expected to be $190,000 for the Fiscal Year 2025 and funding will come from the food service funding account, according to Hickey.\nAn established milk vendor is required as part of compliance with the national school lunch and breakfast programs and federal guidelines, she said.\nThe contract is in effect until June 2026 unless terminated early by Wicomico, which is unlikely, Hickey noted, as Clover Farm is one of the only dairies in the area that has K-12 compliant milk products and has been that way for some time.\nThe board will next meet June 5. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Student seeks to share Choptank River history\n\n May 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: NIAMBI DAVIS Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 967\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON \u2014 Kennedy Thomason grew up as an avid reader of historical fiction.Now, after working towards a degree in history, Thomason is sharing her historical interests with countless others, thanks to her family's river cruise business.\nThe 2019 graduate of Ridgely's North Caroline High School carried her love of history to Chesapeake College, where she graduated with an associate's degree in liberal arts, followed by a transfer to Washington College in Chestertown to major in American studies.\n\"It's the liberal arts version of a history major,\" she explained, pointing to the Washington College website description as \"the exploration of U.S. culture and American national identity from cross-disciplinary perspectives in order to help students develop a rich understanding of the American experience.\"\n\"I chose this major because I'm particularly interested in how our history influences the society in which we live,\" she said. \"Understanding the human experiences that have led us to this point is vital to figuring out where we go from here. The study of history is the key to solving the labyrinth of social, economic and political problems we face today.\"\nAt the Starr Center for the American Experience, Thomason works as a digital archiving intern under the supervision of Melissa P. Kemp, the center's digital archivist and historian.\nShe scans, archives and uploads content into the Chesapeake Heartland archive, which features local African American families and their personal collections of family photos, home videos, yearbooks and other mementos they've collected over the years.\n\"I've learned a lot about digital history and its importance, as well as how tedious it can be,\" Thomason said.\nFor Thomason, the rewards of her Starr Center experience are many. \"It's the confidence boost and sense of community that comes from association with professors and students who are just as passionate as I am. At school I feel a sense of belonging and I'm exposed to opportunities that I never knew were available,\" she said.\nShe considers the most challenging aspect of student life as striking a balance between college, work and life. \"I am a unique undergraduate, especially for a Washington College student, because I have a two year old daughter. Most of the students around me at school still live at home or in dorms and are accustomed to only being responsible for themselves and their studies. Commuting from about an hour away, having a little person depending on me, a household to keep up with, and finding time to work has added many struggles that most of my peers do not have to navigate. But I wouldn't change it for the world!\"\nAs the oldest of the Thomason family's five children, Kennedy counts her parents as inspiration.\n\"I remember watching my mother wrangle five children. I learned a lot from my mom and I admire her and look up to her. She and my dad supported all five of us doing five different things. We have always been a very tight-knit family unit with parents who have provided immense support. I could not do what I do without them. They keep my daughter (whose name is Sailor) when I need them to. Our family has always functioned as a unit working towards whatever goal we have, that day, that week, whenever.\"\nWhen her family purchased Denton's Ellen B from Captain Bill Behlke, it was a given that the River City Cruise Company would be a family affair. Thomason immediately planned to add history as part of the river tours.\n\"I love the Choptank River,\" she said.\nAware of the deep historical roots she was certain that many Eastern Shore residents knew of the area's history and wanted to learn more.\n\"I'm a huge proponent of accessibility to history, which means I'm always trying to think of ways to bring history to the public rather than waiting for the public to seek it out,\" she said. \"The river tours are just one aspect of my advocacy.\"\nThe first year of the River City Cruise Company was a great success. \"I had the time of my life on each trip,\" Thomason recalled.\nHer favorite guests were the people who came along for the ride but found themselves fascinated by the stories of the Choptank's history and heritage.\n\"I also loved seeing people from our community learn more about the land. Although I love and appreciate the out-of-towners that come and enjoy everything the Choptank has to offer, seeing locals being able to connect their lives with the past is truly special. One thing that I tell each cruise is there's no reason that people, states or oceans away should know more about our land than us.\"\nThis year, she's revamping the script and expanding the talking points to make each cruise truly unique. \"I never want someone to feel that they came once and can't come again. I always want people to take away something new, even if they've taken the tour ten times.\"\nRecently, Thomason was awarded funds to complete her own Choptank River History project from the Gerda Blumenthal Grant through Washington College's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.\nOver the summer she'll publish a series of blog posts in conjunction with the Caroline County Historical Society's website that will focus on ways the Choptank has shaped the greater Caroline County community.\n\"My motto for the project has been that people tend to think of rivers as borders, but, historically, the Choptank has been the center,\" Thomason said. \"What exactly this project will look like I am still trying to work out, but I am excited about it. I plan on having at least one public event and my research will lead to a more robust history tour.\"\nThis fall Thomason will graduate from Washington College. She's still trying to figure out what she wants to do post-graduation. Whatever she chooses, the study of history will benefit.\nVisit River City Cruise Company on Facebook, email them at riverruncruise@gmail.comor call 410-673-8201. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Coopersmith recounted his journey as a community college graduate over 40 years ago.\nIn his speech, he referenced two themes he wanted to share with the graduates: the first acknowledges the extraordinary times they are living through, and the second theme is the hope that the graduates embody.\n\"I wish to focus on all of you, our first cohort of students graduating with degrees and certificates that were impacted the most by the immediate and following effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Coppersmith said. \"You have persevered in the most difficult times we have seen as a nation in decades, and your decision to pursue your education, to quote a colleague of mine, Dr. David Harper, is a sign of hope, in and of itself.\"\nAn array of individuals were honored, including Rob Thompson, current director of arts for Chesapeake College, who received the 2024-2026 Bounds Distinguished Teaching Chair Award.\nIn Thompson's speech, he spoke of Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for president in 1872, and her dedication to her dream for a more equal society. He described her as a pioneer for women's rights.\n\"Woodhull never asked for permission to try and change the world or to embark on any of the careers she took up,\" Thompson said. \"She felt an injustice, she found a purpose, and she took action in as many ways as she could think of. For as long as she could stand, it would all be a national figure. But as her story shows, she was just as focused on changing conditions in her home as she was on the nation.\"\nThompson described the importance of shaping homes and communities and the power that adapting after failure has on people.\n\"That's not so much persisting as it is adapting and seeking an alternative,\" Thompson said. \"Chasing dreams requires that you travel down some dark and twisting trails. But you've got to keep searching. My student's dreams and their remarkable capacity to show up with creative minds and passionate hearts have carried me through this career. I'm talking about you guys.\"\nAfter Thompson's speech, Milton Nagel, vice chair of the Chesapeake College Board of Trustees, presented the John T. Harrison Award to Zulema Delacruz Martinez. The John T. Harrison Award is given each year to a student who has demonstrated the highest academic performance, leadership and overall contributions to the college and the community.\nDelacruz Martinez was praised for her commitment to Hispanic and Latino students within the region who are interested in college but may be intimidated by the academic process. She has organized several events to welcome the students and their families to complete college applications and sign up for resource services.\nDuring her speech, Delacruz Martinez recounted her childhood growing up in a nontraditional home and witnessing the extraordinary hard work that her mother had to do to provide for her and her brother.\n\"My mother overcame so many obstacles while making so many sacrifices. It was then, at the age of 8, that I vowed to do the same. I decided I would learn from her experience of having a front-row seat to my mother's hardships as she overcame her adversities. All of those experiences have pushed me to persevere.\"\nShe recounted the resources her advisers gave her and the many people who helped guide and support her to finish. During her time at Chesapeake College, she founded the Hispanic Latino Student Union, learned to be a leader and found her home there.\nToward the end of her speech, Delacruz Martinez praised her classmates and offered words of encouragement.\n\"Take advantage of every opportunity that comes your way. Build upon meaningful relationships with those around you and keep persevering as you keep persevering. Whether that be in your future college endeavors or in your day-to-day lives,\" Delacruz Martinez said. \"I leave you with this quote: 'To make a great dream a reality. The first requirement is a great capacity to dream. The second is persistence.'\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So, we really have 10 graduates this year.\"\nAs part of the program, all seven graduates, individually, got up to the podium to speak, if to say nothing more than thank you to their parents for dedicating themselves to helping them with their educations. Each also selected a verse from the Bible they found impressive and meaningful in their lives. Those verses were shared in a power-point presentation prior to the graduation ceremony.\nSeveral of the parents also spoke at the podium, congratulating their child, and the other graduates.\nAs for future challenges, each graduate listed what's next in their lives. Cody plans on becoming an electrician and will embark on training to become a journeyman in that profession. Ashlyn has a late June wedding planned and will be attending River Bible Institute in Tampa, this fall. She is an accomplished ice skater which she's been doing since she was three. Alyssa will be attending the University of Kentucky this fall, majoring in Equine Business and Management with a minor in Communications. She will be a member of the UK Eventing Team, and hopes to earn a spot of the USA Olympic Equestrian Team. Kylee has many interests, hoping to teach and continue her passion with competitive dancing. Makayla who has been taking classes in dual enrollment at Chesapeake College, was the founder of the college's mental health club which currently has 28 members, and will be serving as Vice President of the college's SGA next semester. She plans to eventually earn her PhD in psychology. Mason will also be attending River Bible Institute in Tampa. Hayden plans to find a career in Cyber Security.\nOf the students who were interviewed, none of them said they felt they missed out on anything by transitioning to the homeschool program. Kylee said, \"I felt homeschool provided me with more opportunities than if I had stayed in regular school classes.\" Makayla added, \"I needed a more mature setting than what I found in school when I left to do homeschooling. I was still able to have my friends and socialize with them.\"\nMost of the homeschool student graduates started in public schools, but moved to homeschooling when the pandemic started. They decided to stay with homeschooling when the pandemic ended.\nTo conclude the commencement program, Pastor Tom Chandler provided \"a challenge\" to the graduates going forward with their lives. He said, \"I'm a homeschool parent. I understand the sacrifices that are made to do a homeschool program with your child. However, the benefits outweigh the sacrifices \u2014 we call that, investments in the future. You parents are to be commended for your commitment to your children's educations.\"\nHe continued, saying \"Jesus said, 'There is no greater sacrifice one can make than to give up their life to another. We all need to remember that in our own lives. Living a life that prioritizes selfless, loving sacrifice for others rather than living for self. Ultimately, living each day to the benefit of the next generation.\"\nHomeschool programs must be supervised by local public schools to ensure that students of all ages are truly receiving an education at home. Largent said, \"We, at Shore Christian Fellowship, serve as an 'umbrella' of the homeschool program. We help make sure parents are following the homeschool program as it is designed. We meet with parents, answer any questions, explain anything they might not understand. We make sure their children meet all the requirements to help their children get their education's properly. You can do it with our help, or do it yourself by going directly to the board of educations to file the proof of learning they are doing at home. Those filings must take place at least twice a year, if you want to do it yourself, rather than ask of help from us.\"\nLargent also said, \"We have more than 100 families registered in the homeschool program at Shore Christian Fellowship who we are helping. It's the most we've ever had.\"\nThere are other families within Queen Anne's County, who report directly to Queen Anne's County Public Schools who are not part of the SCF umbrella. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Led by their teacher, students strategically manage their portfolio over a 10-week period, consistently buying and selling stocks, bonds and mutual funds in effort to increase their portfolio return.\nThe winning teams achieved the highest portfolio returns among student teams in their age group.\nEaston Middle School had winning teams in both the fall and spring regional competitions and a winning team in the fall state competition.\nThe teams were led by social studies teacher Edward Keeler.\n\"Congratulations to Mr. Keeler and his stock market savvy students for winning the MD State Stock Market Games sponsored by the MD Council on Economic Education,\" EMS said in a Facebook post following the awards ceremony. \"Fun fact: Mr. Keeler has led more students to victory and has won this event more often than any teacher in the State of Maryland. We are extremely impressed and are #PantherProud of all who participated and placed.\"\nThe fall regional winning team consisted of Wilmer Rodriguez Argueta, Javir Harrington and Gibson Taylor.\nThe spring regional winning team consisted of Jordan Langrell and Cameron Rodrigue.\nThe fall state winning team consisted of Caiden Sackett, Braden Streaker and Miles Fink.\nThe Stock Market Game competition gives students real-world experience in investing, challenging them to make decisions about the direction of markets, buying or selling stocks, and completing transactions online. With real-time portfolio statement updates, teams are able to see how their team ranks compared to others, as well as the current value of their stocks.\nThe Maryland Council on Economic Education offers the Stock Market Game to students and teachers throughout Maryland each fall and spring to provide education about stock markets, the American economic system and the global economy. Participants develop skills in math, language arts, research and critical thinking.\nTo learn more about the Stock Market Game, visit www.econed.org/page-18321. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Carlson, a decorated veteran and member of the Elks, moved with quiet precision to attach the flag and hoist it. The two men worked together. This was not their first rodeo.\nFeehley takes veterans of all military branches into the schools to teach the kids a simple message \u2014 thank you for your service.\n\"I really think that from after the Korean War, even though this country was in a few conflicts, to when the Gulf War started, veterans were lost in the shuffle,\" Feehley said. \"Nobody gave them any recognition that I think a veteran deserves.\"\nHe is reminded of a famous saying: \"All gave some and some gave all.\"\n\"That all gave some is what I try to impart, which is why I started what we call a teach-in at the schools,\" Feehley said.\nAt Easton Elementary School, he teaches that veterans are all around us.\n\"The veteran is their school bus driver. A veteran may be their teacher. A veteran is their mom or dad or sister, their brother, the next-door neighbor,\" Feehley said.\nSome veterans have a different rhythm than 9 to 5 workers. When it is time to serve, they go.\n\"But that veteran also was away from their family for a long time,\" he said.\nHe and his team teach that some veterans have a tough time when they get back.\n\"That veteran sometimes didn't have the same advantages they have today. They might not be able to take a shower for more than a week. They might not have had any opportunities to watch television or to listen to the radio,\" Feehley said.\nHe teaches that the veterans' families can go through loss.\n\"The veteran's family had to do without their dad or their brother or their uncle or their cousin at the table or the family reunions,\" Feehley said.\nHe tells students not to take the liberties they have for granted.\n\"They have the choice of what TV show to watch. They have the choice of whether to pack your lunch or get it at school. To have the choice of what clothes you are wearing today. If it wasn't for a veteran, you might not have those choices,\" Feehley said.\nSo how should his students and the public engage with vets when we see them? What can be said?\n\"When you are walking through the parking lot and you see a car that has a Coast Guard sticker on the bumper and you see the driver simply say, 'Thank you,' and they will know exactly what you are talking about,\" Feehley said.\nHe says the young students are enthusiastic and engaged. He has members from each of the armed forces for each session where he acts as the moderator.\n\"I direct the question to a particular veteran. When the kids, who are in school, leave (our program) they are smiling. They can't get enough. When the assembly is over, they still want to interact with the veterans up on the stage. Fifth graders, fourth graders,\" he said.\nIt is not a recruiting effort. It is a lesson in gratitude.\nHe does what he does to remind people.\n\"Everybody who served in the armed forces gave something. Here is how we make your life a little better every day. Better than perhaps what it could have been. The kids love it. The teachers love it. The veterans hope they can come back next year,\" Feehley said.\n\"I think the best part is to try and let the kids know what a veteran is and why to say, 'Thank you.'\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I had been trying to figure out how to eliminate the uncertainty, but really, I should have been trying to figure out how to embrace it.\"\nOn Saturday morning, Flacco returned to Delaware Stadium, where he set 20 school records and led the Blue Hens to an appearance in the national championship in 2007, to give the commencement address.\nKeeping with his \"Joe Cool\" reputation, Flacco gave a measured speech, showing little emotion and steering far clear of any controversy.\nHe told the newly minted graduates that during every step of his career \u2014 high school, the University of Pittsburgh, UD and the NFL \u2014 he always came in wondering if he would measure up.\nThose feelings of uncertainty piled up even more later in his career as he struggled in Baltimore and was ultimately traded to the Broncos and then the Eagles and Jets, where he saw limited playing time.\n\"Through it all, I held onto the knowledge that failure was OK as long as I learned from it and got back out there to try again and execute,\" Flacco said. \"It didn't matter if it was coming back after making a bad throw or waiting for my next chance to play. As long as I could embrace uncertainty, thus getting rid of the fear, I could find peace and set my mind to the task at hand instead of worrying about the uncertainty.\"\nLast fall, for the first time in his NFL career, Flacco found himself starting the season on his couch, wondering if any team would sign him. Finally, Cleveland came calling, and Flacco experienced a career resurgence when he led the Browns to the playoffs.\nFlacco said he appreciated the time he got to spend with family, preparing himself to make the most of any chance that he got.\n\"I had put the work in and embraced the uncertainty, and win or lose, I felt a sense of satisfaction with the whole experience,\" he said. \"I was only able to do that because of the relationships I had built and their love and commitment surrounding me, coupled with the experience and knowledge I had gained in embracing uncertainty to my advantage.\"\nFlacco told the graduates to lean on their family and friends for support, work hard to prepare for whatever challenge they face and accept that success may take a while.\n\"Failure is OK as long as you learn from it,\" he said.\nFlacco also made sure to answer what he says is the most common question he gets: What was it like to play with Ray Lewis?\n\"One of the coolest things about playing with him was getting to watch him come out of the tunnel,\" Flacco said. \"And even cooler than watching him was turning my attention to the visiting sideline and seeing all of their jaws on the turf.\"\nHe noted that he grew up idolizing players like Lewis and Ed Reed but assumed that anyone with that big of a personality and reputation for toughness on the field would be mean and unwelcoming.\n\"I couldn't have been more wrong,\" he said. \"I realized that they were not only really good football players, but they were also really good men. These guys were tough, had seen a lot and respected hard work.\"\nFlacco had quite a few fans in the crowd Saturday, including graduating seniors Jake DeMilta, Jordan Haft and Holden Morelli, who were all sitting in the front row wearing Flacco's #5 jersey instead of their graduation gowns.\n\"He's the greatest player in school history,\" DeMilta said.\nMorelli was wearing Flacco's Jets jersey instead of the more common Ravens or UD jerseys.\n\"I've got to be the only person with this in the whole country,\" he said, laughing.\nUD President Dennis Assanis told the 6,149 members of the Class of 2024 they should be proud of their hard work over the past four years.\n\"Perhaps you have not yet been named Super Bowl MVP like Joe,\" Assanis said. \"But you have all certainly accomplished so much during your time at the University of Delaware.\"\nHe told graduates that, in a time of great disruption by artificial intelligence and other technological advances, they should never underestimate the power of empathy, compassion and human understanding.\n\"The personal and unique moments that inspire, excite or motivate us, the moments that make us cry, laugh, love and care, and our shared feelings and thoughts, as members of this special campus community, truly define the human experience,\" he said. \"I hope you will always remember that human connection is precious and irreplaceable.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Shelly was part of the Terrapin Program through Maryland Environmental Service, the agency heading up the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island.\nAs part of the research program, Shelly spent her first year growing from a tiny hatchling to a young terrapin at Kent County Middle School before being release back on Poplar Island.\nFor Copeland, this was his first time raising a terrapin, an experience he described as \"amazing.\"\n\"Not only was it truly great for the students to learn more about terrapin ecology and physiology, it was also a good opportunity for students to learn about the environmental impacts we as humans impose on literally our backyard, the Chesapeake Bay,\" Copeland said.\nCawthorne said she loved every minute helping raise Shelly and was very thankful for the experience.\n\"Seeing the look of awe and excitement in the students' faces whenever Shelly made her way to my classroom was nothing short of wonderful. The students learned so much about terrapins and we were very sad to see her go,\" Cawthorne said.\nFor more than a decade, the State of Maryland has been rebuilding Poplar Island.\nIn its day, there were families that called Polar Island home. It also hosted a getaway used by the most powerful people in Washington, D.C., including U.S. presidents like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman.\nThe waters of the Chesapeake eroded Poplar Island so much so that by 2000, it was predicted the entire island would soon be washed away.\nThe Poplar Island restoration site is still under construction. While no people live on the island, many species of wildlife now call it home \u2014 or at least a stop on their migratory route.\nScientists led by biologist Willem Roosenburg at Ohio University are conducting a study of terrapins on Poplar Island. They locate nests and count and measure eggs.\n\"A lack of land predators, undisturbed sandy shorelines, and a variety of habitat types make Poplar an ideal terrapin nesting site,\" the Terrapin Program website states.\nWith around 800 diamondback terrapins \u2014 the state reptile of Maryland \u2014 hatching annually on Poplar Island, the researchers collect about 150 eggs each year and give the juveniles to schools raise.\nThis \"head start\" program aims to determine if this level of human involvement in terrapins' early stages of life gives them a better chance in the long run of surviving in the nature world, according to the Terrapin Program site.\nIt also gives students the opportunity to more personally engage with the Bay's ecosystem.\n\"Through this program, students are playing an important role in relevant, cutting-edge research focused on the conservation of the species,\" the Terrapin Program site states. \"The combination of scientific applications, hands-on involvement and the emotional attachment to the terrapins provides a unique opportunity to inspire a meaningful connection with the Chesapeake Bay.\"\nThrough releasing Shelly back into the wild, Cawthorne and Copeland both said they hope the middle school students learned that any action they take, no matter how large or small, can have a huge impact on the health of the Bay.\nThe field trip was funded in part by the Kent County Public Schools Education Foundation Fund.\nPart of Mid-Shore Community Foundation, the education foundation fund helps cover the costs of extended field trips, provides mini-grants to teachers and more.\nFor details about the Kent County Public Schools Education Foundation Fund, or to make a donation, visit www.kent.k12.md.us/Foundation.aspx. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Raising the future at the Talbot County Free Library\n\n May 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 649\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Do you ever feel as if your later years have become haunted by your first? I hear a cardinal singing from the branches overhead and, for a moment, I'm a little boy again, sitting with my mother on the stone steps that led down to Mr. Bowman's garden, sunlight dappling the ground.The scent of Dentyne gum works for me too (my father chewed Dentyne), a bonnet similar to those my sister wore at Easter, even an I.V. needle stuck in the back of my hand like the one they put there when I had croup can work the trick.\nEvery day a connection like these snaps into place, elicits a memory, then colors my day.\nAll of which makes me wonder if the psychiatrists have it right, that our adult lives merely recapitulate our childhoods. Perhaps in response to different stimuli, and hopefully exercising a little more maturity, don't we all, from time to time, run up against the same fears, feel joy in the same way, seek to be loved as we were as children?\nIf true, this would explain why so much art finds its source in childhood: Marc Chagall's Shtetel, Virginia Woolf's Cornwall, Marcel Pagnol's Provence, Willa Cather's Nebraska.\nTo write, to paint, to create a new reality from scratch, one must feel a little playful \u2014 and playing, of course, is the province of childhood.\nBut in truth, doesn't each of us create a new reality from scratch every day? Certainly many of the best solutions I've come up with in my personal and professional lives came about because, as I considered whatever challenge I faced, I gave myself permission to think outside the box: to invent, be creative, be childlike.\nAll of which should convince us, if there was ever any reason to doubt it, that the lives and experiences of our children's earliest days portend those of their adulthood, that even as we direct them toward maturity, we must do everything in our power to give their first years a happy, playful tenor.\nThe Talbot County Free Library's ninth annual Chesapeake Children's Book Festival will take place come rain or shine on Saturday, June 22, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the library's Easton branch. This year's festival will feature 22 children's book authors and illustrators, all of whom underwent a rigorous vetting process before being selected to participate.\nChildren who sign up at the festival for the library's Summer Reading Program will receive a voucher good for one free book (while supplies last) from the attending author of their choice. It's always fun to see the pride children take in asking the author they've selected to sign the book they've received.\nThis year's authors include Andi Diehn, author of the beautifully illustrated \"Mama's Days,\" the Finnish-American author and illustrator Mirka Hokkanen, best known for her \"Kitty and Cat\" picture books, and acclaimed children's book author and illustrator Timothy Young, who designed and built Muppets for Jim Henson and created the very first Simpsons toys. Young's latest work is a middle-grade chapter book \"Mac and the Millstone of Time,\" set in Talbot County's Old Wye Mill.\nTraditionally, the festival resembles a small, library-sized carnival, designed to create a special day of fun for little ones.\nThis year, for the first time, the Maryland State Opera Bears will perform. The Opera Bears, Grizzelina and Grizzelino, are large puppets who, along with their puppeteers, show children how opera can tell magical stories.\nIn addition to the warbling bears, the Imagination Library, Flying Cloud Bookstore and the Daughters of the American Revolution will offer crafts, the Judy Center will have their Make-A-Book table set up, and the Pickering Creek Audubon Center and the Master Gardeners will make sure that Mother Nature provides an important part of the day's excitement.\nAll in all, the Chesapeake Children's Book Festival should be another great day for children at the Talbot County Free Library, the place where their futures grow bright. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She thought it would be a great opportunity for her students to do research and community service for veterans.\n\"It was a great opportunity,\" Gosselin said. \"I love working with students, and I love what it's all about, and even more since we're getting to support our veterans.\"\nDuane Hilghman, a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, assisted in presenting certificates to the students for their work. He expressed gratitude to the students and their teacher for the beautiful posters they created and for young people's efforts for veteran services on the Eastern Shore.\n\"We're getting the youth involved in a very important project and dance to support our veterans, and it means a lot to us when you get youth involved in activities like this,\" Hilghman said. \"They learn and understand what happened years ago.

MICHAELS \u2014 On Wednesday evening, the community supported 63 students from St. Michaels High School as they received their diplomas.Senior Class President Madi White welcomed the students' loved ones and congratulated the Class of 2024 for their accomplishments. In her speech, she expressed the hardships that her class had endured to get to graduation.\n\"The faces, the smiles, the tears, they all represent a journey of great memories and unforgettable hardships,\" White said. \"Four years, 1461 days and 35,064 hours \u2026 That number didn't feel real because it's hard to believe that we spent a kajillion seconds waiting for this moment ... Before we dive headfirst into our ceremony, we must acknowledge how we got here. Our support system was none other than the best.\"\nAt the end of her speech, White reminded her classmates that they are not facing the future alone but with that robust support system.\nAfter the welcome speech, graduate Will Bridges presented the mantel, a time-honored tradition at St. Michaels High School. Bridges then passed the mantle over to Lexi Rockwell, president of the junior class.\n\"It is a symbol of all the ideals and principles for which our school stands and a badge of seniority,\" Bridges said. \"Tonight, we must surrender the club to the class of 2025. We hereby give the honor, place, privilege and responsibility to live up to the lofty ideals of which the garment is a symbol. I say to you, take it, love it.\"\nNathan Henckel gave the valedictorian address. In his speech, he expressed the excitement that his class had in anticipation of this day. Henckel quoted Hannah Montana, referring to her as \"one of the most influential icons of our time.\"\n\"'Of course, I always knew this day would come; we'd be standing one by one with the future in our hands, so many dreams, so many plans,'\" Henckel said. \"Yet, despite being in this room right now, with all of our future plans set, we cannot ignore how this journey began.\"\nHe expressed the difficulties of losing a part of his education journey to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Henckel said that as he reflected on his high school years, he found that his teacher, Lauren Greer, had encouraged and uplifted him.\n\"Whether I needed to ask the question about the stem from protein synthesis, have an email proofread, or simply needed a space to vibe..., 547 was always a place for me,\" Henckel said. \"It's because of teachers like this that I feel extremely prepared for all my future endeavors.\"\nTalbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi, an alumnus of St. Michaels High School, congratulated the class. Pepukayi advised the graduates to appreciate this time in their lives and to do as their chosen class motto said: \"Just keep swimming.\"\n\"Be an example, inspire others, use your talents and gifts, bring it around, take everything in this evening,\" Pepukayi said. \"Because soon enough, you'll be back in the race ... Congratulations. Best of luck, no matter if you breaststroke, sidestroke, butterfly or doggy paddle. Just keep swimming.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The students sitting before you tonight have exemplified resilience more than any of us adults have before the age of 18. They have had musicals canceled, sports seasons cut short, dances canceled, and couldn't find sustainable employment during the pandemic. But I can tell you one thing\u2026.these kids came out on top! I don't want to focus on what they have lost tonight, but rather what they have gained.\"\nIt was noted that this class rose above COVID their freshman year, earned $14,095,882 in scholarships and completed over 37,291 service learning hours.\nTCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi came up to the lectern in a green robe.\n\"I am humbled to serve a little over 4,500 students but for this evening we are focusing on these 278 students that will soon become Easton High Warrior alumni,\" Pepukayi said. \"... Be great and make mistakes. Fail forward again and again. Dare to learn something new.\"\nValedictorian Iven Chen stood up from his chair and addressed the audience and his fellow Warriors. He remembered losing the whole first year to COVID and not even coming to campus. But the proper rhythm was restored as the four years went by.\n\"If you're like me, you'll worry about not making enough memories once you realize your time is almost over. You feel the urge to make the most of your lasts as they start piling up: your last year, your last homecoming, your last game, your last prom, all leading up to your last day,\" Chen said.\nHe hit a funny and poignant note about life's choices as they become adults.\n\"If there's one thing you should take away from this, it's that you have the ability to pursue your own path. You've done this before when navigating the maze of high school, and you can definitely do it again. Heck, if there are too many walls in your way, just be like the Kool-Aid man and bust your way through them,\" Chen said.\nThe salutatorian was Sabin Long, who said he noticed how time passing had changed him, ultimately helping him reach this moment of graduation.\n\"Wherever you all are going in the next part of your life, I hope the community there welcomes you the way the community here has welcomed me \u2014 the way you all have welcomed me,\" Long said.\nSenior Class President Colin Smith and TCPS Board Member and Senior Class Executive President Samantha Jessee also addressed the packed auditorium.\nSmith said, \"Take this opportunity to break the pattern. Run that race, take that trip, make that new friend. We only have one opportunity to live our lives. We only live once, and there are no second chances.\"\nJessee said, \"Being captain of the cheer team allowed my passion for school spirit to thrive. EHS has laid out the blueprint for our successes, making conquering and achieving our dreams more than obtainable. In the words of Elvis Presley, you've gotta follow that dream, wherever that dream may lead.\"\nThen it was time for the diplomas to be handed out. Dr. Pepukayi and Emily Jackson, president of the Talbot County Board of Education, handed out 287 diplomas.\nAfter every one was honored, they turned their tassels and threw their caps in the air. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He talked about a student who, over the last four years, went from not attending class, to arguing with Tucker to calling Tucker the reason they come to school every day.\n\"There were a lot of times that I didn't want to get up and come to school, but I thought (about) what you told me,\" Tucker said about the student. \"And it inspired me to get here. Maybe not on time, but I got here.\"\nThe graduation ceremony brought tears and laughter on Thursday evening. Along with the speeches, the CSD chorus performed \"I Lived\" by OneRepublic, and the students, along with some staff and administration members, performed \"Don't Stop Believin'\" by Journey and \"The Time of My Life\" by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now, it's your time to shine.\"\nThis year's valedictorian is Ben Loller, who will be heading to prestigious Brown University this fall to study computer science. The salutatorian is Madison Messick; she earned a full ride to the University of Maryland, College Park.\nThose are just two of the many accomplishments Hemstetter listed.\nThere were increased numbers of students who achieved dual-completer status for finishing a Career and Technical Education pathway, of students taking Advanced Placement classes and exams, of students earning dual enrollment credits through classes at Chesapeake College and Washington College and so much more.\nLooking to their immediate future plans, 70% of the class will be attending a two- or four-year college or trade school, 26% of the class will be entering the workforce and 4% have enlisted in the military.\n\"As you venture into new territories \u2014 be it college, careers, workforce, military or other pursuits \u2014 never forget the power of your authenticity,\" Hemstetter told the class. \"It's your genuine self that will open doors, forge connections and create lasting impact.\"\nDr. Karen Couch, superintendent of Kent County Public Schools, offered her remarks in a video message. She was attending her grandson's high school graduation in Howard County.\nCouch spoke about the immense pride and enthusiasm she has for the graduating seniors, many of whom she has known since she arrived in Kent County at the start of their second-grade year.\n\"Graduates, as you stand on the threshold of new beginnings, remember the journey that brought each one of you here today,\" she said. \"With those first uncertain steps in our hallways to this moment of time, you have demonstrated resilience, passion and dedication to excellence.\"\nCouch said the class of 2024 \"embodies the best of our values: integrity, resiliency and a commitment to learning.\"\n\"You're not just graduates, you are the future, ready to make your mark on the world,\" she said. \"My heartiest of congratulations goes out to the Class of 2024. May your futures be bright, your lives full of joy and your contributions meaningful.\"\nThis year's graduation speaker was Darius Johnson, a member of the KCHS class of 2011 and now the Digital Justice Fellow at Washington College's Starr Center for the Study if the American Experience.\nHe spoke to the students about the importance of finding their own paths to success. He said that if he had followed other people's vision of success, he wouldn't be happy.\n\"In this next chapter, each of you must define what success means for you,\" he said. \"Write your plans in pencil, embrace change and walk with certainty, even if people doubt you, or if you doubt yourself. I'm here to tell you that you'll be alright.\"\nIn addition to being salutatorian, Messick has served as a student member of the Kent County Board of Education and the Citizen Advisory Committee as well as in the Maryland Student Page Program of General Assembly.\nShe spoke about how the Class of 2024 \"navigated through a whirlwind of experiences, challenges and triumphs\" and persevered in the face of hardships.\nShe said each member of the class has unique talents and urged them to use those \"to build a future that reflects the values of compassion, empathy and equality.\"\n\"May your futures be as bold and brilliant as the people I know you are today,\" Messick told her classmates. \"Together, let us continue to change the world by simply being ourselves.\"\nLoller, who among his extra-curricular activities also has served on the Citizen Advisory Committee and been a member of the KCHS Coding Team, used a metaphor about three skiers in his speech.\nHe said the first skier is focused on the trees and ice patches \u2014 the obstacles in the way to success. For the second skier, he said it is all about the path. He said the third skier failed to set the alarm and never made it to the mountain.\n\"I believe there have been times when we could all relate to him,\" Loller quipped.\nHe encouraged his classmates to be like the second skier, saying that by focusing on the path they will naturally overcome the obstacles and hardships along the way.\n\"Stay focused on your goals, stay focused on the destination, stay focused on your experiences. And keep your path forever clear,\" Loller said.\nClass of 2024 Secretary Jessica Rosanova served as the hostess of ceremonies. Jaeda Hoxter, class of 2024 vice president, introduced the platform guests. Guadalupe Duarte Arellano, Student Government Association president, gave the Senior Welcome and Ryan Myers, class of 2024 president, delivered the Message to Seniors. Class Historian Melissa Landon introduced Johnson as the guest speaker.\nCapping off the commencement ceremony, SGA Secretary Addisyn Litton led her classmates through the turning of their class rings and tassels, announcing them as graduates of KCHS.\nAs parents and family members and teachers, staff and administrators cheered, mortarboards went flying into the air and the class of 2024 showed their 24-karat shine, celebrating their graduation from Kent County High School. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County talks Blueprint with MACo\n\n June 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 776\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Maryland Association of Counties President Johnny Olszewski told the Dorchester County Council at a council meeting June 4 that Dorchester County is not alone in \"feeling the pinch\" from the Blueprint for Maryland's Future requirements.\"It's large counties too,\" said Olszewski, who is also the county executive for Baltimore County and the Democratic nominee Maryland's 2nd congressional district. \"I think we're seeing, every year, a few more jurisdictions of varying sizes as sort of hitting that point where it's like 'Oh man, how are we going to actually make this all work?'\"\nAt the June 4 meeting, which Olszewski and MACo Executive Director Michael Sanderson attended to present on the association's efforts and hear from the county, council members talked about their concerns with being able to fund Blueprint.\nBlueprint is a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state through increasing education funding by $3.8 billion over a 10 year period.\n\"I'm not against education, I'm not against teachers,\" council member Ricky Travers said. \"I want to see the kids get a great education. But is throwing money at it going to do it?\"\nTravers said that funding the Blueprint requirements is forcing the county to strip its other services.\n\"They want to buy a Lamborghini on a Toyota budget, and they want to pay for it in a really short time,\" he said.\nSanderson told the council that it's not lost on him that income taxes and property taxes are the main revenue sources for county governments. He said that because two-thirds of Marylanders are at the \"absolute cap\" on the income tax, property taxes are the only way counties are going to be able to pay for their share of the Blueprint.\n\"It's exactly the wrong way to try and fund it,\" Sanderson said. \"Even if you're a big fan of the progressive policies in the Blueprint.\"\nThose policies include expanding full-day pre-K for children in families with incomes up to 300% of the federal poverty line, increasing teacher starting salaries to $60,000 by 2026, implementing a new college and career readiness standard and increasing funding for special education and multilingual learner students.\nIn November, MACo sent a letter to Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson and Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne Jones writing that \"in many ways,\" the Blueprint is a one-size-fits-all approach to investing in education in a state with \"diverse local government capacities, processes and abilities.\"\nThe letter says that record county funding and additional mandated funding for Blueprint will make it difficult for counties to fund other things in their jurisdiction.\nIn the letter, MACo makes a variety of requests \u2014 including a more comprehensive cost analysis of the Blueprint, an increase in state aid for the renovation and construction of pre-K facilities and more time for the development of educator career ladder models \u2014 to ensure the Blueprint's success.\nAt the meeting, council member Rob Kramer pointed out that 72% of Dorchester County is considered critical area, like wetlands, and cannot be built on. He said that under the new critical areas map, that percentage will increase to 78%. With only so much space that can be built on, how much the county's property tax revenues, which pay for Blueprint requirements, can increase without raising taxes is limited.\n\"We're a small county and we basically rely on property taxes to operate,\" Kramer said. \"So that makes it tough on the ones that do own property here.\"\nCouncil member William Nichols said he refuses to raise taxes on seniors. He said their are a lot of seniors in his district, and they can't afford higher taxes.\nDuring his presentation to the council, Sanderson brought up the Cade Funding Formula for community colleges, which received a reduction from the state for fiscal year 2025, and highway user revenues, which Sanderson said could receive cuts in the future.\nOlszewski said talked about how this affects counties, especially when they have to meet Blueprint requirements.\n\"It sort of becomes, well we can't fund community colleges and roads and all the other things and meet their obligations,\" he said about the Blueprint requirements.\nSanderson said that for any county governing body that doesn't meet Blueprint requirements, its county income taxes will be sent directly to the schools, rather than to the county.\nAt the end of the conversation, Olszewski talked about the importance of facilitating these conversations between MACo and Maryland counties.\n\"They're so helpful because they us sort of inform the legwork (we're) heading into,\" he said. \"And it's already sounding like Blueprint is going to be another major issue that we are going to be taking up in the year ahead.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Children struggling to read (for any reason), can request a session with a canine and handler at the library. It is proven that canines open many doors for children struggling emotionally and physically. Children feel comfortable with a canine. Canines break down barriers, do not judge, are fluffy, motivate and create trust.I have been visiting special needs classrooms in Talbot and Queen Anne's counties, as well as hospitals, nursing homes, physical therapy centers, doctors' offices and psychological sessions since 2012 with my canines. I have had four canines, all female rottweilers, approved as therapy dogs. My current dog, and previous dog, were members of Alliance of Therapy Dogs and Crisis Response Canines.\nThe requirements for both groups are strict. Dogs and handlers have a background check and must pass handling tests. My dogs are desensitized to loud noises, children yelling, falling on them, sirens, etc. They are obedient and trust me. My dogs have over 1,000 visits, and have earned National Recognition for their Therapy Work.\nLast August, I set up my calendar with visits to seven classrooms at Easton Elementary School, for the September-December session. A few weeks before the session began, I was forwarded a letter by one of the teachers, saying that no dogs were allowed at school. My first thought was that this decision would hurt the many children we help.\nI never received any updates. Nothing. After a few months, I was told (anonymously) that the decision was based on \"policy change,\" I was told Jovie and I would be back in classrooms before 2024. Not to be. It is now too late in the school year to start visiting classrooms. I'm not sure if, or when we will be allowed back in Talbot County Public Schools.\nIn 12 years, my dogs have never had an issue. We have excellent insurance coverage through our therapy groups. We do all of this without compensation. We do this for the children. I am deeply saddened by this. I can't believe this would happen in Talbot County. My hope is that we will be back visiting children in need, at Easton Elementary School, next September.\nBARBARA LEE JEFFERSON\nEaston \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Aiman, 54, of Rising Sun, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault, a misdemeanor that is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. In exchange, prosecutors dismissed related charges of reckless endangerment and false imprisonment.\nAiman's defense lawyer, Thomas C. Morrow of Towson, told the judge that Aiman is on administrative leave, a status that school officials assigned Aiman shortly after a Rising Sun Police Department officer filed criminal charges against him in the wake of the early-May incident.\nJoseph Buckley, who is the Cecil County Public Schools associate superintendent for administrative services, told the Cecil Whig on Thursday that the situation is under review.\n\"We are aware of the legal matter that's facing one of our employees, and we're going to follow all of our human resources processes to access the situation to address the matter,\" he said. \"We'll be working with the employee to address the matter. Other than that, at this point, we really have no further comment.\"\nAiman chased the two boys in the early evening of May 4, which was a Saturday, after they rang the doorbell at his residence in the 200 block of Turtleneck Court and ran away \u2014 a prank known as \"ding dong ditch.\"\nAfter catching the teens across the street from his home, Aiman forced them back to his front porch, where he made the boys wait for police officers to respond after calling authorities and making a harassment complaint, according to court records.\nOfficers responded to the scene at 7:32 p.m., and Aiman told them that he \"gripped one up,\" referring to one of the teens. Aiman maintained that he gave chase after the second time that the ding-dong-ditch prank had been pulled at his residence that evening.\nIn the courtroom Wednesday, Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Verratti reported that Aiman grabbed one of the boys by his sweatshirt, lifted him up by the garment and kneed him in the ribs. Verratti said that Aiman handled the situation in \"an aggressive manner,\" which included him yelling at the boys.\nPolice informed Aiman that \"he could not put his hands on juveniles and that it does classify as an assault,\" according to court records.\n\"(Aiman) did not seem to understand, asking what he was supposed to do \u2014 let them run away. (Aiman) continually stated that he just held the kids on his front porch until the police arrived,\" court records show.\nAiman did not know the boys, who live in his neighborhood, according to the defense.\nInvestigators filed charges of second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and false imprisonment against Aiman on May 5, a day after the incident, and served him the criminal summons on May 6, court records show. He was released on personal recognizance. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

In front of a packed Buccaneer's stadium, several representatives from the class gave parting words of advice to their classmates.Darcy Lynn, the Class of 2024 valedictorian, welcomed family, friends, faculty, and her fellow graduates. She acknowledged the significance of the day and the importance of the decisions the graduates would make about their future. Lynn emphasized that while major life decisions, like choosing a college or career path, are daunting, it is the small, everyday choices that truly define a person's character.\nShe stressed that these minor actions, from how one interacts with others to behaviors when no one is watching, are the true indicators of who a person is. Lynn reminded her classmates, \"These actions make up who you are inside and reveal your true character.\"\nLynn paid tribute to Jacob Sloan, a classmate who died during their seventh grade year. She said that many graduates were wearing red heart pins in his honor. Sloan was known for his kindness and his habit of making others smile through small acts of generosity, like sitting with someone who was alone at lunch or making someone laugh when they were feeling down.\nIn an emotional tribute, Lynn continued, \"Jake always went out of his way to brighten someone else's day by performing small acts of kindness.\"\nSloan's lasting impact on their class, and his memory continues to inspire them to be kind and supportive of others. She encouraged her peers to carry on Sloan's legacy by making the world a better place through their everyday actions.\n\"While Jake may not be with us today, the mark he left on many of us remains,\" Lynn said. \"It is our job to carry on his kindness through our next steps in life.\"\nIn concluding her speech, Lynn urged her classmates to consider who they wanted to be as they moved forward in life. She reminded them that small choices, such as giving a compliment or helping someone, could significantly impact others.\nQuoting Taylor Swift, Lynn said, \"No matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind.\"\nShe ended by congratulating her classmates and encouraging them to embrace their future with the same spirit of kindness and community that Jake Sloan had exemplified.\nJake Sloan's message endures in Queen Anne's through the foundation set up to honor him.

He said he is most excited about the opportunity to serve the community and be a part of something bigger than himself.\n\"(As superintendent) you're just one small piece,\" he said. \"But I think you can be the catalyst to help change a school system and ultimately change the community.\"\nThompson hopes to bring the district's ranking up from 23rd to 15th in the state. To do that, he said the district will need to improve its instructional practices as well as the climate and culture within its schools.\nBefore taking on the role of interim superintendent, Thompson served as the district's assistant superintendent. Thompson previously served as assistant principal and principal of Mace's Lane Middle School.\nBoard President Mike Diaz said in a news release the board was fortunate to attract \"well-qualified candidates\" to the open position, but Thompson \"stood out as the best fit.\"\n\"The entire board looks forward to working alongside Dr. Thompson to ensure that all Dorchester County children have the opportunity to reach their full potential,\" Diaz said.\nThompson's official start date as superintendent is July 1. According to the news release, the board will vote to approve Thompson's contract at its regular meeting Thursday.\nThompson said he is \"all about the students\" and wants to ensure the district is producing kids that can compete in all fields at a national and global level.\n\"Right now I don't think we've done too good of a job of that,\" he said. \"So we've got room to grow, and that's what we plan on doing over the next five years.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Students are chosen according to the practices of their individual schools and are responsible for providing information about activities and events occurring at their school and the elementary and middle schools in their area.\nSimmons introduced both students and their extensive leadership roles and accomplishments.\nOdidika is a senior at Colonel Richardson High School. She is treasurer of the Straight Gay Alliance, a member of the National Honor Society and the Technical Honor Society, and a member of the LEO Club, orchestra and chorus.\nAfter graduation, Odidika plans to be a pediatric emergency physician.\nBelle is a junior at North Caroline High School. She is treasurer of the class of 2026, as well as treasurer of the Student Government Association, student ambassador for the Maryland Business Roundtable, co-director of the Regional Policy Director of the Eastern Shore of Maryland AYA and a member of TRIO Upward Bound. She is involved in the intensive law trial program at Stanford University and plans to study law after graduation.\nSimmons described the students as outstanding representatives of their schools and said he looked forward to the leadership they will bring as student representatives to the board.\n\"We are thrilled to have you guys, and we're looking forward to a great year together next year, so thank you all for being here tonight,\" Simmons said. \"This is the only night where you won't be sitting up here at a table for a while and contributing and being a part of it, but we are thrilled to have you here tonight and being able to come out.\"\nA former student representative was in the crowd as well, and she advised Odidika and Belle to take time to visit the other schools, including the elementary and middle schools in the county. She also encouraged them to check out any events happening in those schools and engage with the community so they have a better understanding of the community they will help make decisions for.\nAt the end of the introductions, Simmons also gave the student representatives a piece of advice.\n\"Feel free to make the most of it and be part of it and help provide your voice when we're at board meetings and feedback and those things as well,\" Simmons said.\nThe student representatives will begin their responsibilities in September. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "DCPS approves fiscal year 2025 budget in 3 to 1 vote\n\n June 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1386\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Although the Dorchester County Board of Education approved the district's fiscal year 2025 budget on June 3, not everyone felt what was proposed was ready for approval.On social media, county residents shared their concerns, and board member Chris Wheedleton, who could not be at the meeting due to a work conflict, said he was shocked when he found out the budget had been approved.\n\"I as a board member then should have had the opportunity to receive feedback from the community (and) talk with the community about some of the ideas that we should have around that budget so that, by the time we voted, I was equipped to have all that feedback,\" he said.\nOne aspect of the balanced $88.5 million operating budget that drew particular concern \u2014 and has since been reversed \u2014 was the decision to remove media specialists from libraries, redistributing them to other positions in the school system and putting instructional assistants in the libraries.\nThis would have contributed to the district saving over $313,000, or 32.3%, in salaries and wages expenditures compared to fiscal year 2024, according to board documents.\nBoard member Talibah Chikwendu, who voted against approving the budget, said during the meeting that she thought the board needed to look harder at the budget to find other ways to save that money.\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat Thursday, Chikwendu said she did not like some of the ways that the district's financial concerns were being resolved.\n\"I like the fact that we got a chance to work to resolve them,\" she said, later adding, \"It wasn't about media specialists as much as it was about any frontline staff.\"\nChikwendu said if another category of staff had been moved around like that, \"the objection would have been the same.\"\nAt the meeting, North Dorchester High School librarian Jacqueline Bennett talked about the impact of her role in the school and asked that the district not remove media specialists from libraries.\n\"I understand that you have to make tough decisions, but I've devoted my life to this,\" she said.\nBoard member Sheri Hubbard, who voted in favor of the budget, said she agreed that \"it would be a shame\" to move media specialists to other positions in the district, and clarified that approval of the budget did not mean they couldn't amend it.\nIn an interview Friday, Board President Mike Diaz, who also voted to approve the budget, said Dorchester County Public Schools Interim Superintendent Jymil Thompson made a decision later in the week to not redistribute its media specialists to other positions in the school system.\nOn Wednesday morning, DCPS communications and community outreach specialist Valerie Goff said in an email that the district is \"looking at other means to mitigate the budget shortfalls.\" Goff said Thompson met with district media specialists June 6 to reassure them that their positions are secure.\nLeading up to the district announcing Thompson's decision, multiple took to social media expressing frustrations. Some called on residents to reach out to the Board of Education.\nLucas Thorpe, who ran for Diaz's board seat in the May primaries and lost, took to social media to express his discontent.\nThorpe said in an interview that he doesn't think taking librarians out of the libraries would benefit literacy scores. He said the entire situation points to a larger issue of elected officials trying to run the school system like a business, without considering students and staff.\nThorpe brought up the district's alternative education contract with Vision Quest, which the district is paying more than $93,000 per month for, as well as two alternative education programs with Transforming Lives for elementary and middle schools that the board approved at the June 3 meeting. He said that although alternative education is important, the public needs to draw concern to these contracts.\nDiaz said in an interview that alternative education is something DCPS has used for many years. He said the Board felt Vision Quest was \"best poised\" to provide services to the district, and mentioned there are services built into the program like family functional therapy.\nUNANSWERED QUESTIONS\nAlthough Wheedleton was aware the budget had been included on the agenda for the meeting, he said he communicated with the Finance Committee \u2014 made up of Diaz, board Vice President Susan Morgan, Thompson and DCPS Assistant Comptroller Laurie Dale \u2014 ahead of the meeting to say he didn't think the board was ready to approve the budget.\nWheedleton told them he still needed answers to some \"significant questions\" related to the budget approval process so that he could support the budget moving forward.\n\"I asked, both verbally and in writing, when we would be having a community meeting to share both the challenges and the priorities that we were working through, when we would have a meeting where we were expected to vote and what needed to be submitted to either the state or the county,\" Wheedleton said in an interview with the Star Democrat on Friday. \"And I still have yet to receive answers to those questions.\"\nIn the interview, Wheedleton spoke about the importance of receiving community feedback in the budget process. He said that, instead, the board made a decision at a meeting they knew he wouldn't be able to attend and gave no time for community feedback on Thompson's budget presentation.\nWheedleton said that although he is expressing his concerns publicly, he remains committed to working with the board to find \"productive solutions.\"\n\"I really do want us to learn from this and move forward in a way that we can all work together to make the best possible decisions for the schools and our students,\" he said.\nAt the meeting, Diaz said unlike previous years where it would take about two months of work to get the budget to the finish line, the fiscal year 2025 budget process started in January.\n\"I can't tell you how many meetings we did and the hours that we committed to really getting into this thing to make it what it is right now,\" Diaz said at the meeting. \"Nobody's ever going to be perfect, and I think there's probably still some more work to do ongoing as we move through this thing.\"\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat Friday, Diaz said there are some things the board will agree on and others that it won't. He said it's inevitable that there are times when board members can't attend a meeting.\n'FISCAL CLIFF'\nThe balanced $88.5 million operating budget is a $7.4 million increase from fiscal year 2024.\nState revenue sources total $59.9 million, an increase of $4.6 million from fiscal year 2024. County revenue sources total $23.7 million, a decrease of $265,200 from fiscal year 2024. The remaining revenue comes from fund balance carryover from prior years and other funding sources, like investment income and building use income.\nCompared to the fiscal year 2024 budget, fixed charges expenditures increased 22%, from $17.8 million. Pupil services had the second largest increase between fiscal year 2024 and 2025 budgets, increasing 7.8%, from $2.7 million to $6.8 million.\nIn his budget presentation at the June 3 meeting, Thompson talked about the \"fiscal cliff\" that is coming with COVID-19-related Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funding and Maryland Leads grant funding coming to an end.\nDiaz said the district is trying to dial it back when it comes to spending. In January, the board asked for an audit trail so it could look at every financial transaction the district makes.\n\"We had an overspending problem,\" Diaz said. \"And to get the house back in order, we've got to do certain things to right that ship. And it's painful sometimes. And they're hard decisions to make.\"\nBoard members also talked about costs that are out of the district's control. Diaz mentioned inflation and Morgan, who voted to approve the budget, brought up a requirement of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future that the district will need to increase teacher starting salaries to $60,000 by 2026.\n\"That's not an easy thing to do,\" she said. \"And that's causing a lot of money to be poured into personnel.\"\nThompson warned that it's possible more cuts will need to be made down the road.\n\"We really have to look at our financial situation,\" he said, later adding, \"Our financial situation hasn't improved, and we've made a lot of poor decisions that have gotten us into this situation that we're in currently.\"\nThis story has been updated to include the district's response. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore had decided to postpone implementing the experimental Blueprint for Maryland in our schools, due to the $2.7 billion deficit accrued by the state of Maryland.The Blueprint has been described as follows:\n\"It has taken the focus of schools off teaching students the academic and content knowledge they need to be successful adults in our society and made them 'one stop shopping' for services like medical, dental, nutritional, social engineering and mental health. It has promoted the implementation of 'restorative discipline' which has created a generation of students who are out of control and violent since there are no consequences for bad behavior. It has drained our schools of teachers as they flee to other states where working conditions are better even if the salaries are lower. These are just some of the negative impacts.\" (Easton Gazette, Dec. 20, 2024)\nHow disappointed was I to read in The Star Democrat (Jan. 15, 2025) that the Talbot Board of Education wishes to implement the Blueprint anyway, especially equity in math, with an $8.6 million increase to the school budget. With nearly 60% of Talbot County students (grades 3-8) showing a lack of proficiency in basic English language skills, while mathematics proficiency for Talbot County students stands at a dismal 17.2%, the last thing we need is for our children to be guinea pigs in yet another social experiment.\nWhat is equity in math? According to Edutopia: \"Math teachers can use short activities based on student goals related to equity in order to make classes feel more inclusive and accessible.\" The key words are \"feel\" \"inclusive\" and \"accessible.\"\nI was a sixth grader once, a sixth grader who hated math class. We had a strict teacher, of whom most of us were afraid. But we all learned to multiply and divide, in spite of the negative feelings, unlike, it appears, many of today's children who are not even being encouraged to memorize their times tables.\nThose negative feelings can give way to feelings of confidence and assurance when a subject has been mastered. I beg our educators to return to basics and stop making our children the latest casualties of yet another half-baked, ill-conceived progressive scheme for remaking society according to the designs of Karl Marx or Saul Alinsky.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
